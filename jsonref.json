Aged three or four, he was left in a car in a supermarket car park not for long, maybe a few minutes, but long enough to wonder if his parents might not come back. The feeling never left him: “In a child’s mind, it is possible to be alone for ever.”Somehow, in his subconscious, that feeling of potential abandonment attached itself to animals. He was disturbed by the way humans might silence or confine animals, in zoos or on farms, even at home. Years later, he wanted to find a harmless way of photographing that feeling.How to do it? First, he wandered around his neighbourhood in east London looking for cars with a bit of cinematic glamour, then he left a note on the windscreen saying: “Can I photograph your car and put a dog in it?” To get the dogs, he sidled up to their owners in parks and asked them if he could put their dog in a car at night and photograph it in the name of art. He was astonished that most said yes.His new book contains nearly 50 of these set-ups. There are dalmatians in the back of Citroëns and jack russells in ice-cream vans Prospero, pictured here, weighs up his options in the driver’s seat of a Mini. Usborne had imagined the pictures would share a kind of noir-ish dread to match his infant fears. Some did, but in others the dogs relaxed or just settled down to nap. The variety of response adds to the sense of strangeness.

He reels backwards, mouth open, eyebrows raised in amazement at your startling arrival. You can see the whites of his eyes.This is the one-two action – you appear, he reacts – of this tremendous etching, made in 1630 when Rembrandt was around 24. It is a portrait of the artist as a young star. All of its quicksilver whorls and curlicues are put to the service of theatre: the image as incident, as mutual encounter. It takes the convention of eye-to-eye contact and transforms it into vital drama.But 24 is not precocious, in terms of art history. Raphael and Dürer were virtuosos before the age of 10. Picasso, in his own words, could draw like Raphael as a child. Rembrandt is not regarded as a prodigy. Indeed, it is the very novel aim of this exhibition – the largest ever devoted to the first decade of his career, 1624-34 – to show just how hard Rembrandt had to work to become Rembrandt.Young Rembrandt is filled with unexpected curiosities and rarely seen masterworks. It follows the artist from his teenage beginnings in Leiden to the glory days of Amsterdam, with riches and a thriving workshop. You see him faltering, practising, correcting and even junking work en route. There are duff portraits, where the sitters all look the same, and unfulfilled drawings. The curators do not stint on his failures.It is unusual enough to see some of Rembrandt’s early Bible paintings, over-coloured and hyperbolic in their melodrama. But it is odder still to have a museum draw deliberate attention to his faults. In an etching circa 1625, The Circumcision, baby Jesus is a stiff toy, the bystanders are badly drawn dolls, and there is no sense of depth or perspective. Look closer and you can see that the artist felt the same. He made several attempts to erase botched lines.Early Rembrandt can be blockish, crude and clumsy. Figures may be out of proportion, the composition skewed. He is so variable that attributions remain contentious. A painting called Let the Little Children Come to Me was sold at auction as Dutch School as recently as 2014. It is shown here for the first time as a Rembrandt, and while the artist seems to be here in person, as a compelling self-portrait at the top of an ungainly pyramid of parents and children, the painting is such a pile-up of idioms it is hard to believe that it is not by several different artists.The shocked self-portrait is reprised in a painting of Delilah shearing off Samson’s hair. Rembrandt’s face is everywhere. Something of him appears not once but twice in the background of a 1626 work called The Baptism of the Eunuch, seriously drawing attention away from the holy moment itself. And there is a dark-eyed and tousle-haired self-portrait – as recognisable as it is flagrantly unexplained – in the mysterious image known only as History Painting. This is the young Rembrandt as you first see him at the Ashmolean.Three self-portraits greet you at the door: each surprisingly small (fame seems to enlarge them in mind) and equally astonishing. From Munich comes the haunting young artist as a lone soul in the forests of the night, eyes blacker than the shadow falling over them. He is perfectly positioned at the boundary between darkness and light as to seem almost unreachable – until you notice the eyes look straight back at you.An ink drawing, watchful and open-mouthed, and an etching of the artist with a tangled lovelock and wild eyes come from the same phase, circa 1629. Painting, drawing, print: Rembrandt is working in all three media at once – and in hybrid. He used a split-tipped drawing quill to work the copper plate (nobody had done it before, and he never did it again). His experiments are so extensive and radical.What is wonderful about this presentation is the way it takes your eye directly into his shifting thoughts. Rembrandt uses an etching plate like a sketchbook, working all over it, turning it round and round to get a good clear patch for a new and better vignette. If he doesn’t like a drawing, he cuts it up and recycles the pieces. One captivating sequence of prints shows the artist changing his mind on the plate as he goes. A portrait of his father starts as a head and shoulders, expands to include the body and finally closes right in on the head, deleting all the rest: the mind is what matters.A red chalk sketch of this elderly parent, deeply asleep, seems to have received a brown wash when his father died in 1630. It acquires a memorial solemnity. And the several portraits of Rembrandt’s ageing mother, so lined and creased, with her distinctive nose, are equally affecting.She is doing exactly what her son asks of her – sitting very still, quietly waiting while he depicts her in all her humility. Her character is revealed in these passing moments as much as her appearance: the patience she gives to her son.Rembrandt worked incredibly hard to become an artist of Shakespearean dimensions. The 140 works here are barely a fraction from a decade of continuous revolution, in which he is constantly finding new ways to convey the profundity of our human drama. By the third gallery of this exhibition, he is painting himself as a potentate of theatrical grandeur, with fancy dress costume and props to match. The paint – lavish, darting, radiant – rises at every level to the performance.There are too many works by his friend Jan Lievens in this show. And you arrive at Rembrandt’s “mature” style via a room full of his students’ homages, before seeing what it was that actually inspired them. (The National Gallery, coincidentally, has a show by one of those pupils, Nicolaes Maes, inventor of an eavesdropping scenario in which one character in a painting urges you to listen to another in the next door room: piquant rather than profound.)By 1634, Rembrandt had painted The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp and other renowned masterworks that are not in this show. The object is to follow the steps, and missteps, of his journey along the way. You will have the strongest sense of the streets around him – of hawkers and beggars, comical dogs and overfed burghers copiously peeing – as much as the imaginative empathy of his visions Jeremiah lamenting the destruction of Jerusalem as in some floating nightmare of grief a later print of The Circumcision, now condensed to the scale of a sonnet, in which the Christ child screams.What this show reveals, too, is an exceptional sympathy with old people in one so young. A nearly life-size portrait of a woman aged 83 shows the marks of woe as much as experience. And perhaps most magnificent of all is the painting long known as The Noble Slav, on loan from New York’s politan Museum. It shows an elderly man in a feathered turban and oriental costume. The brushwork is dazzling, mimicking the glitter of his gold chain, the translucent sheen of pearls and the shimmer of silk with a thousand different strokes. But rising out of all this is Rembrandt’s monument to the man himself: proud and resolute, even as the light fails.• Young Rembrandt is at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, until 7 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c31c2eb931cc028f473cc6ce9585d525b7421dd1/400_438_4504_2702/master/4504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f86905bf5622d2d54844ec5447bd8d19","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"The coronavirus outbreak, refugees in Lesbos, a memorial for Kobe Bryant and Paris fashion week – the best photography from around the world in news, culture and sport"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4c916f636f7dd233b7a66a7daf35659fab1899b/0_0_1125_1500/master/1125.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b4e9ea829f81c625cd12c17fcc8efce 720w","title":"jan morris thinking again interview youre talking to someone at the very end of things","story":"From her reporting on the first ascent of Everest to her acclaimed career as writer and historian, Jan Morris – who transitioned from male to female in the 70s – has led an extraordinary life. Now, at 93, she is publishing what may be her last bookTrefan Morys is a low 18th-century barn, stone-built, slate-roofed, topped with a weather vane and surrounded by a dense tangle of garden beneath a towering elm tree. Jan Morris has lived here, halfway up a hill in the top-left corner of Wales, with Elizabeth, once her wife, now her civil partner, for the past 30 years. Before that they had raised their four children in the big manor house a little further down the lane toward Criccieth and the coast. Like everything about Jan Morris’s long and unique life there is a kind of storytellers’ magic to Trefan Morys. Last week, I drove up through Snowdonia and down toward the Irish Sea, to listen to some of Morris’s myths and legends, while the last of storm Dennis rattled outside.Hearing about most lives you have a sense of beginnings and middles and ends, but Morris’s 93 years resist very much in the way of this-led-to-that. It is a life that forms instead around improbable adventures a million miles from here – Morris, at 26, was the only journalist to accompany Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay on their 1953 ascent of Everest at other times she wrote about living on Field Marshal Montgomery’s family houseboat on the Nile, and in a palazzo on the Grand Canal she met Che Guevara in Cuba she visited Hiroshima after the bomb, and reported on the trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961. In her dreamy books about cities – most memorably Venice and Trieste – the world can seem a permanent Xanadu.These unlikely journeys are nothing, though, in some ways, beside the defining romantic quest of her life. Jan Morris was born James Humphrey Morris on 2 October 1926, in Somerset. As she recalled in her memoir, Conundrum, “I was three or perhaps four when I realised that I had been born into the wrong body, and should really be a girl.” She was under a piano at the time, listening to her mother play Sibelius. Conundrum detailed a pioneering journey across a perilous internal border. A journey that involved years of hormone therapy and culminated in reassignment surgery in Casablanca in 1972, before a return here, to Llanystumdwy, to Elizabeth and to their children.From the vantage of 93, some of this life has started to seem like a foreign country to Morris. She still lives with Elizabeth, who suffers from dementia. Their youngest son, Twm, a poet, writing in Welsh, lives in a cottage across the road and “is a miracle”, Morris says, in the help he gives them. Jan does not travel very far these days, though her trusty Honda Sport R still sits ready for action on the gravel outside. Her books have shrunk in scope, too. The last two, the bestselling In My Mind’s Eye and her new book, Thinking Again, are composed of daily diary entries that unlock Morris’s storehouse of memory as they describe children in coffee shops or dogs on the beach at Pwllheli. The pace of those books is set by the 1,000 daily steps up and down the lane outside that she commits to as an exercise regime, and the marching tunes that she whistles as she goes. The tone is of someone who has seen the whole world and decided on this place as an ending.In the long, beamed sitting room of Trefan Morys, we talk first about the house itself. When they all lived down the road, the kids used to come and play here in the stables, overgrown with bramble. Later Jan and Elizabeth felt the big house was unmanageable, so they found a buyer, cleared out the horse stalls here, brought the books and bookcases from the other place, along with the weather vane, renovated and moved in.In the final diary entry of Thinking Again, Morris dwells on “hiraeth” that Welsh word that is often translated as nostalgia, but which she – half-Welsh, half-English, another hybrid – feels more like a national addiction to longing. “It is a different thing for Twm, for example,” she says. “I don’t have his instinct for Welshness, with him it is more basic, it comes out of the soil, for me it is more an idea.”While we talk, from time to time a small fluttering bird taps its beak on the window as if to gain entry. “Do you hear the bird tapping?” Morris asks. “It used to portend death didn’t it? We have it every day at different windows.”The tapping of the bird leads Morris into the first of a few apologies that she no longer has the eloquence she once did as an interviewee. “Sometimes I fear I am not exactly compos mentis,” she says. “It comes and goes. Like with Elizabeth. The other morning I was taking her breakfast on a tray and I fell, and there were cornflakes everywhere, and marmalade. I thought, well no good asking Elizabeth to help with this. But she came out, and miraculously was transformed into the real Elizabeth, and briskly helped me clear it all up beautifully. I said to her a few minutes later how encouraging she can still do that, but she could not remember what had happened.”Morris looks around her bookshelves, the thousands of books that line this long room floor to ceiling. “People always say: ‘Have you read them all?’” she says. “No. but I have an emotional attachment to them all. I pick an old book out and if it is interesting I read a few pages. I put letters and photographs and cards in them to find later.”Does she still get a lot of correspondence?“Mostly from people who go to Trieste or Venice and read my books, and say ‘What did you mean by that’? To be honest I’m not always sure.”As a wandering writer – she is widely acclaimed for inventing a way of writing about cities that blends history and imaginative description and a sort of psychology of place – Morris made much of herself being an outsider. In Conundrum she wondered whether her “incessant wandering” as a journalist for the Times and the  and freelance “had been an outward expression of my inner journey”. She has resisted the idea of biography, though she allowed Derek Johns, her former agent, to write her literary life, Ariel. In it he notes at one point how “it is interesting to consider that the move from male to female and the move from Englishness to Welshness were roughly concurrent”. She herself has suggested that she always favoured the “soft side” of her character more than “the hard side”, and that Wales was closer to that softness. She is reluctant to talk much about her adventure in gender, since she has said so much before. But I wonder simply if she has a sense of a before and after in the voice of her writing?“I don’t think my writing changed that much,” she says. “Except that perhaps I became a little more relaxed about it.”She gets up from her chair, remembering something.“I found a book the other day, which I thought might interest you. It was about the trilogy of books which was the centrepiece of my life really, I hesitate to say intellectually, but certainly emotionally.”This was the trilogy about the rise and fall of the British empire, which Morris wrote over a period of 10 years, beginning in 1968. The recently discovered notebook she shows me, is full of all her – or James Morris’s – original plans and schemes for the books: a carefully handwritten catalogue of dates and events, with sections on ideologies, politics, wars, cross-referenced to every nation under British rule. “I look at something like this and I think ‘Can that really have been me?’” she says.It feels like somebody else’s work?“It certainly does! I can’t fathom it. My tendency has been to jump in and tell stories. I had forgotten all of this.”The Pax Britannica trilogy demands the adjective “magisterial” more readily than just about any other series of books I can think of. It begins with the birth of Victorian ambition and ends with the death of Churchill. Written with all Morris’s characteristic brio it is a compulsive exploration of patriotism, of manly endeavour, which ends in elegiac retreat and submission. Morris began the books as James and ended them as Jan I wonder if that trajectory of tone in her history reflected that great change in her own life?Perhaps, Morris suggests, and shrugs. “But I should say I would never use the word change, as in “sex-change” for what happened to me. I did not change sex, I really absorbed one into the other. I’m a bit of each now. I freely admit it. There is obviously all of this debate about it all at the moment, but for me it was never a black and white thing. Never could be. It was a sort of instinct. A question of spirit almost. But that’s all in that book I wrote, isn’t it?”At one point in Conundrum, written in 1974, Morris wonders whether she might be simply ahead of her time, a premonition of gender fluidity to come. Whatever the case, she had a certainty about her “slow motion Jekyll and Hyde” that was all her own. When the transformation was complete in Casablanca, she writes “I had reached Identity” with a capital I. (Elsewhere she described it as “At-one-ment”). She pictures herself as Ariel, “a figure of fable and allegory” in pursuit of the “higher ideal that there is neither man nor woman”. Had the possibility of safe surgery not existed, she had no doubt she would “bribe barbers or abortionists, I would take a knife and do it myself, without fear, without qualms, without a second thought”.There is a wonderful moment in that book when she returned to Wales and went to the local shop for the first time as Jan. No one who knew her batted an eyelid, and very few have done since. Has she been surprised?Morris’s recent diaries are too wise to get bogged down in identity politics, and the disruptions of Brexit and Trump only rarely invade her thoughts. Once again, she offers a simple solution.“If you are not sure what you think about something, the most useful questions are these,” she says. “Are you being kind? Are they being kind? That usually gives you the answer.”She gets up from the sofa, inviting me to come and see the rest of the house. On bookcases and on desks and tables there are wooden scale models of ships from all over the world – those on the bookshelves relate to the books behind them – a sampan for books about south-east Asia and so on. On either side of the doorway are two bardic chairs awarded to Twm at Eisteddfods. On the ceiling there is the painted “eye of a poet” looking down.Propped against one wall is a photograph of the summit of Everest taken by the Indian air force who flew over the expedition as it made its last assault on the summit. Morris points out the place she climbed to at 22,000 feet. “That wasn’t a bad story was it?”I get her to remind me of the bones of it just to hear her tell it. When she was assigned by the Times, which sponsored the ascent, she had never climbed any mountain before. They had to work out a way of protecting their scoop and get it into the paper in time for the Queen’s coronation. Having hugged Hillary in congratulation, Morris scrambled down an ice field and sent a wire overnight with a pre-coded message. It read: “Snow conditions bad stop advanced base abandoned yesterday stop awaiting improvement.” This meant: “Summit of Everest reached on 29 May by Hillary and Tenzing.” Morris made a lot of friendships on the mountain and they all stayed in touch for the rest of their lives. She is now the last survivor from that last camp.Upstairs, we are joined once again by the tap-tapping bird at the window. Morris points out the huge pen-and-ink drawing she did of the islands of Venice, on which if you look very closely you can see their eldest son, Henry, heading back from school over the Accademia bridge, in the days when they lived in the city.In one corner of the loft room is Morris’s desk – “where the magic happens” – and behind it on the wall a portrait of a man in naval uniform. “Jack Fisher,” Morris says. “I am going to have an affair with him in the afterlife. I love him dearly.”Over the years, ever since Sir Robin Day bluntly asked Morris about her sex life in an interview on the BBC (about which she formally complained), she has batted away questions of lust, which she suggests has never been her thing. Part of that deflection has centred on her lifelong crush on the most unattainable of pin-ups: Admiral Jack Fisher, charismatic First Sea Lord of the British fleet in the Great War, a man who died six years before Morris was born.Morris wrote a book about Fisher in 2007, in which she noted that “I first set eyes on him in a photograph some time in the late 1940s, and knew at once that he was the man for me.” That image went with her up Everest in 1953 and on every adventure that followed. She ushers me into her bedroom where there is a poster-sized photograph of Fisher on the back of the wardrobe door and points outside to a small balcony where there are twin sculpted busts – one of her head, one of the admiral’s.“He is devilishly handsome,” I suggest.“No it’s not that,” she says. “But we will have our affair.”As she describes her writing life Morris admits to the selfishness that made it possible to undertake her great voyages of self-discovery. In a less than kind review of Conundrum when it came out in 1974, Germaine Greer, essaying misgivings about gender change that persist, wrote that “as Jan Morris plucks at your sleeve for a girlish heart to heart, you wonder about Elizabeth. Her unbroken silence is the truest measure of Jan Morris’s enduring masculinity.”Elizabeth was moved to respond to Greer, writing: “I am not very silent and certainly not anguished. The children and I not only love Jan very dearly but are very proud of her.”Jan and Elizabeth reaffirmed that love in a civil union ceremony in Pwllheli in 2008, witnessed by a local couple who invited them to tea at their house afterwards. “I made my marriage vows 59 years ago and still have them,” Elizabeth said at the time. “After Jan had a sex change we had to orce. It did not make any difference to me. We still had our family. We just carried on.”When they sold the big house the couple retained a small island in the neighbouring Dwyfor river where, in the manner of Welsh princes and poets, their ashes will be scattered together. The place will be marked with a slate headstone that is currently stored in a cupboard under the stairs, reading: “Here lie two friends, at the end of one life.”We walk around the house in order to see the statues of Admiral Jack and Jan staring into eternity on their pedestals, and Morris apologises for a fleeting lapse in memory as I question her a bit more about her fantasy man.“I am sorry to be so indistinct,” she says. “The truth is, you are talking to someone at the very end of things. I felt that first about two years ago. I felt it creeping up, and now I know I am approaching the end.” She has written elsewhere about how her spirit will haunt two places in particular – the banks of the river Dwyfor and the seafront in Trieste. I wonder whether she still thinks that. “Death?” she says. “I think of it as a blank.”Apart from Jack Fisher?“Apart from Jack Fisher!”We sit inside for a while at the long table that dominates the kitchen, eating some sandwiches for lunch that Twm has left under tinfoil. There is an Aga, and a Welsh dresser and a low shelf on which are arranged seven pots of homemade marmalade, a different one for each day of the week, which now represent Morris’s principal vice (up until two years ago she claimed to have drunk at least a glass of wine every day since the second world war, but has lapsed a little now).I suggest that there must be a part of her restless soul that misses the travel. Can she revisit those worlds by reading her own books?“I ashamed to say I do read my own books quite a bit,” she says, and laughs. “There are one or two good things. But then you also feel, oh do please stop going on…”Does she ever feel hemmed in here?“Never, no. The sea is just over there. I wouldn’t want to be entirely in the mountains. I go down to the sea most days. I suppose the day will come when I cannot drive the Honda. Then I suppose I will have to walk it.”Is she still managing to do her thousand daily steps?“I try. Quite often now it is a bit too much for me. But I try to do some exercise every day, the gods insist on it.”There is a lovely diary entry in the current book in which, with the weather raging outside, she determines to do her thousand steps indoors: “round and about the sofas I whistled my way, never pausing, left, right, left right… counting the paces on my fingers and sometimes bursting into song, until at last, breathless but triumphant, I reached the millennium on my thumb.”She is whistling an old show tune now while she is making coffee. I am reminded of the fact that for her Desert Island Discs with Sue Lawley all of Morris’s choices were songs by Irving Berlin. This went back to Morris’s first job as a trainee reporter on the Western Daily Press aged 16. She was sent to Bristol docks to meet a big band sent to entertain the US troops stationed there during the war. Berlin was with them. “He was terribly kind to me. So I have always thought of him ever since as the ideal American. I’ve always loved his songs anyway.”To prove the point, standing at the kitchen sink, Morris breaks into one of them. The voice that won her a choral scholarship to Oxford as a boy is cracked a bit now, but she can still carry a tune. The song is from the film This Is the Army, and she cuts to the rousing chorus, in marching time:Someday I’m going to murder the bugler!Someday they’re going to find him dead!And then I’ll get that other pupThe guy who wakes the bugler upAnd then spend the rest of my life in bed!“I find myself whistling that many mornings these days,” Morris says, “but then I always get up, of course.” She pauses for a bit, and concentrates on sorting out the kettle and the coffee and the mugs and the milk and takes care in bringing all of it over to the table. “Life has its problems,” she says, with a half-smile. “But it also has its delights.”• Thinking Again by Jan Morris is published by Faber, £16.99.

She replied emphatically: “Yes,” almost before he had finished the question. Ghosts have peopled her fiction from her first novel, Every Day Is Mother’s Day, and her memoir, Giving Up the Ghost, made clear how permeable the boundary between the living and the dead can seem.“St Augustine says the dead are invisible, they are not absent.” Mantel opened her first lecture with this quotation, and her historical novels are such towering achievements partly because she appears to inhabit the thoughts and sensory experience of her characters so fully – not so much as if she is channelling Thomas Cromwell, but as if she, disembodied, has projected herself back into his mind and drawn the reader with her as if we are, in effect, ghosts at his shoulder, seeing through his eyes. This effect is particularly noticeable in The Mirror and the Light, the long-awaited third instalment of her trilogy about the blacksmith’s son from Putney who became Henry VIII’s right-hand man and the architect of much Tudor policy that reverberates down to the present.It’s been eight years since the publication of Bring Up the Bodies, for which Mantel won a second Booker prize, but we find Cromwell exactly where we left him, in May 1536, at the moment the French executioner has struck off Anne Boleyn’s head with his sword. Cromwell is much taken with this sword: Toledo steel, incised with the words of a prayer. It is only later in the book that we learn the words on the blade: Speculum justiciae, ora pro nobis. Mirror of justice, pray for us. It’s one of many references to both mirrors and light stitched subtly throughout the book, though the title comes directly from a line Cromwell offers Henry:The question of whether Anne and the men executed for adultery with her received justice is one that haunts many of the characters in the novel, not least the king and Cromwell himself.But the dead are not absent. In the Tower of London, Cromwell sees shades of the men whose deaths he contrived, and feels their company when he steps into his barge at night, he hears footsteps in his bedroom and dreams of Anne’s execution as if it’s part of a series of altar paintings. The answer he gives Henry – “Go forward, sir. It’s the one direction God permits” – might be taken as his personal credo, but Cromwell’s path forward takes him along a knife’s edge. Anne’s death has not made his own position more secure – if anything, the reverse, as the imperial ambassador Chapuys gleefully reminds him: “For when all is said, you are a blacksmith’s son. Your whole life depends on the next beat of Henry’s heart, and your future on his smile or frown.”The reference harks back to the vivid scene in Bring Up the Bodies when Henry is injured in a tournament and believed dead. Cromwell’s instinct is to flee, but in the event he is the only one who dares lay hands on the king and thump him back to life (his French servant Christophe claims he grabbed the king and bellowed into his face: “Breathe, you fucker, breathe!”). But Chapuys’s words also offer a grim dramatic irony, one instance of many throughout the novel.Because we all know how the story ends. And this is where Mantel’s supreme artistry is most evident: she creates suspense and apprehension where none should exist. “You succeed not despite the fact that your reader knows what happens, but because of it,” she has said. The present-tense, Cromwell’s-eye narrative means we walk with him towards an outcome that we know but he does not, so that we are both with him and at a distance, helpless to warn him. When, iding up the spoils of the dissolution, he picks out the monastery of Launde as a modest, pleasant place he might claim for his own retirement, we remember Francis Bryan’s prediction: “If the king turns on you, it will not be like when old Henry Guildford quit and went off to the country to prune his fruit trees and enjoy the birdsong. Remember how Wolsey fell.”One reviewer complained of Wolf Hall that it had no plot, which strikes me as a wilfully obtuse failure of reading. These books are precision-engineered, and none more so than The Mirror and the Light. It may be less obviously dramatically focused than Bring Up the Bodies, which ned less than a year and concentrated almost exclusively on events leading up to Anne’s death, but the plot here is shaped as meticulously as any thriller. Chekhov’s gun is there on every page: words spoken carelessly or in jest are later repeated in a court of law, their meaning twisted gifts given in innocence are produced with new motives ascribed. The technical skill required to marshall the events of these four years between 1536 and 1540 – which include the dissolution of the monasteries, the northern uprising known as the Pilgrimage of Grace, and the political manoeuvring that resulted in Henry’s short-lived fourth marriage to Anna of Cleves – while rendering those events comprehensible and dramatic to contemporary readers, is breathtaking.It’s impossible not to miss Anne Boleyn the force of her ambition, and the savage verbal sparring that she enjoyed with Cromwell. Mary, Henry’s daughter by Katherine of Aragon, is a pale substitute, though she, too, attempts to pit her will against Cromwell. Mantel portrays her as a lonely, stubborn young woman, inviting pity but not sympathy, one moment giving in to emotional outbursts, the next desperately trying to assume the lofty dignity of a princess. Her half sister, Anne’s toddler daughter Elizabeth – now known as My Lady Bastard – is most often encountered furiously screaming. The only other woman who comes close to Anne’s vitality on the page is her sister-in-law, the waspish and conniving Jane Rochford, who allows Mantel’s foreshadowing to reach even beyond the limit of this book. “He thinks, you have destroyed one queen, is one enough?” Later, we meet flirty, teenage Katherine Howard, destined to become the second of Henry’s wives to be beheaded, along with Lady Rochford, who arranged her adulterous trysts.Despite the absence of Anne’s glittering wit, the novel is shot through with wry comedy. There is a glorious scene in which the innocent, literal-minded new queen, Jane Seymour, is cornered by her family and Cromwell, all anxious to inquire, delicately, how the wedding night went. Jane earnestly expresses some consternation: “My difficulty is, he wants me to do some very strange things. Things I never imagined a wife had to do.”The frantic glances exchanged over her head are so visually perfect – “Edward looks desperate. Tom begs, “Master Secretary?” – that the scene makes you long for the next instalment of the TV adaptation. Edward manages to ask: “… does it conduce to getting a child?” “I wouldn’t have thought so,” Jane says. It is left to Cromwell to coax from the queen what exactly the king asked of her in the bedchamber – which is, of course, the punchline to the scene.But Jane does not last long, and the quest to find Henry’s next wife provides Cromwell – promoted first to baron and then to earl – with an opportunity to continue his project of remaking England. The nation’s founding myths have permeated all three books, and Cromwell is uniquely placed to select how much of that is useful, and how much can be erased, like the entwined initials of Henry and Anne that must now be painted over in every royal palace. But ultimately his fate is to discover that the past – both his own and his country’s – insists on reappearing.“Can you make a new England? You can write a new story. You can write new texts and destroy the old ones, set the torn leaves of Duns Scotus sailing about the quadrangles, and place the gospels in every church. You can write on England, but what was written before keeps showing through…”Cromwell’s desire to forge a political alliance with the German Protestant states through a marriage with Anna of Cleves, thereby creating an alternative power bloc in Europe, proves his downfall. Henry takes a dislike to his bride, though Mantel challenges the received idea that it was because Anna was unattractive in her version, it is the young woman’s unguarded reaction to Henry’s bloated, ageing appearance that wounds the king’s pride and turns him against her. Inevitably, blame falls on Cromwell.We have always known where it would end. From the first page of Wolf Hall, when we saw through the eyes of 15-year-old Thomas as he lay bleeding on the Putney cobbles, watching his father’s boot as Walter yelled “So now get up”, we were always going to share that perspective again as his head rested on the executioner’s block. Anyone who has read Mantel’s masterly novel of the French Revolution, A Place of Greater Safety, will know that she can lead her characters to the scaffold with such fine and telling detail that the reader experiences a visceral reaction to the terror of death. She did it again in Bring Up the Bodies with the execution of Anne Boleyn the small detail of Anne, blindfold, reaching up to adjust her cap, and Cromwell in the wings, willing her to get her hand out of the way so the headsman can make a clean strike. There is nothing sentimental in Cromwell’s end, only the most devastating humanity, leaving the reader with stopped breath and a sense of amazement, after closing the book, that the real world is continuing outside.It feels redundant to state that The Mirror and the Light is a masterpiece. With this trilogy, Mantel has redefined what the historical novel is capable of she has given it muscle and sinew, enlarged its scope, and created a prose style that is lyrical and colloquial, at once faithful to its time and entirely recognisable to us. Taken together, her Cromwell novels are, for my money, the greatest English novels of this century.

They, were paid depending on the weight of beans they picked, with sacks weighing up to 45kg.

Child labour was found on all the farms.A human rights lawyer who viewed some of the programme’s evidence suggested both companies were in breach of international labour regulations laid down by the UN’s International Labour Organization.“The conventions are very clear in that they don’t want children’s education to be compromised,” said Oliver Holland of solicitors Leigh Day. “If children are working 40 hours a week, there is no way they can also be having a proper education.“These are all unsafe conditions for children essentially, and in those conditions children simply shouldn’t be working.”Dispatches calculated that of £2.50 spent on a typical cup of coffee on the high street, the shop receives 88p. Staff receive 63p and 38p goes on tax. A profit of 25p goes to the coffee company – such as Starbucks, which has an annual global revenue of more than £20bn, and has nearly 1,000 shops in the UK alone.After other costs are accounted for, 10p is left for the coffee suppliers, of which 1p goes to the farmer, who uses a fraction of this to pay coffee pickers.Dispatches reporter Antony Barnett shared some of the evidence with Clooney. Last week, the Hollywood star, who sits on Nespresso’s sustainability advisory board, said: “I was surprised and saddened to see this story. Clearly this board and this company still have work to do. And that work will be done. I would hope that this reporter will continue to investigate these conditions and report accurately if they do not improve.“The check and balance of good corporate responsibility lies not just with the company itself but also independent journalists like Mr Barnett to hold everyone’s promise to account.”Nespresso’s chief executive, Guillaume Le Cunff, said: “Nespresso has zero tolerance of child labour. It is unacceptable. Where there are claims that our high standards are not met, we act immediately. In this case, we’ve launched a thorough investigation to find out which farms were filmed and whether they supply Nespresso. We will not resume purchases of coffee from farms in this area until the investigation is closed. Any issues we uncover will be dealt with diligently and firm action will be taken.”Starbucks also said it had a “zero tolerance for child labour anywhere in our supply chain”. It told Dispatches: “We’ve launched a full investigation into the claims brought by Channel 4, carried out in partnership with a leading third-party auditor.”Barnett said: “It’s great that George Clooney supports our investigation but if he is serious about sorting out this issue, he needs to make sure Nespresso puts its money where its mouth is. It’s far too easy to announce an investigation and halt supplies from these regions but this will further punish the farmers and desperately poor families who rely on them. The reason these kids are working is that their parents – and the farms they work on – are not paid enough.“Dispatches will air on Monday at 8pm.

The government is trying to convince the EU it is serious about its red lines and prepared to walk away from negotiations if the UK’s “regulatory freedom” is not accepted – a no-deal scenario that would result in tariffs between the EU and the UK. Yet at the same time the government is telling the world that the country is “re-emerging after decades of hibernation as a campaigner for global free trade”, as Boris Johnson put it a few weeks ago.The EU is understandably confused. It’s odd to claim to be campaigning for free trade at the exact moment you are creating new barriers to trade. If we were so committed to frictionless trade, we wouldn’t have left the EU and having decided to leave, we would have sought to maintain a close economic relationship with the EU, like that of Norway, rather than seek a basic trade deal like Canada’s.As well as creating confusion, the narrative also absurdly idealises free trade. Johnson invoked Richard Cobden and the idea that free trade is “God’s diplomacy – the only certain way of uniting people in the bonds of peace since the more freely goods cross borders the less likely it is that troops will ever cross borders”. But the idea that free trade prevents war was shattered by the outbreak of the First World War, which brought to an end the first era of globalisation.We also know that the domestic effects of free trade are more complex and problematic than Johnson suggested. Economic liberalisation increases efficiency by removing friction but also creates disruption and has huge distributional consequences – that is, it creates winners and losers. In a democracy, these consequences need to be mitigated.The world is not the same as in Cobden’s time. Tariffs are at a historically low level – and many non-tariff barriers have also been removed. Most of the possible gains from trade liberalisation have been realised. Johnson talked about the dangers of a new wave of protectionism. But as the economist Dani Rodrik argues, the big problem in the global economy is no longer a lack of openness, it is a lack of democratic legitimacy.The UK should abandon this confusing narrative and own the way it is creating new barriers to trade – and do a better job of explaining the legitimate reasons for doing so. We should be talking about the need to balance openness and economic efficiency with democracy and a sense of control, which is ultimately what Brexit was all about. Instead of claiming to be a “catalyst for free trade”, as Johnson put it, we should be talking about how the UK is trying to recalibrate globalisation and, in doing so, make it sustainable.In the three decades after the end of the cold war, globalisation got out of control as barriers to the movement of capital and goods were progressively removed – what Rodrik called “hyper-globalisation” to distinguish it from the earlier, more moderate phase of globalisation. This kind of deep integration necessitated the development of a system of rules that have constrained the ability of states to pursue the economic policy, particularly industrial policy, they want, and undermined democracy.Hyper-globalisation created a sense that “the nation state has fundamentally lost control of its destiny, surrendering to anonymous global forces”, as the economist Barry Eichengreen said. Throughout the west, we are all struggling with the same dilemma – how to reconcile openness and deep integration on the one hand, and democracy, sovereignty and a sense of control on the other.Within the EU, however, economic integration and the abolition of barriers to the movement of capital and goods went further than in the rest of the world – and the evolution of the principle of freedom of movement after the Maastricht treaty meant that barriers to the internal movement of people were also taken away as the EU was enlarged. What happened within the EU might be thought of as “hyper-regionalisation” – an extreme example, in a regional context, of a global trend.EU member states have lost control to an even greater extent than other nation states – albeit to anonymous regional rather than global forces – and this loss of control was felt intensely within the EU. It is therefore logical that this led to an increase in Euroscepticism. Whereas the left wants to restore some barriers to the movement of capital and goods, the right wants to restore barriers to the movement of people.However, having left the EU, the UK is uniquely well placed to find a new equilibrium. The UK has an ideological commitment to free trade that goes back to the abolition of the Corn Laws in the 1840s – which Johnson’s speech expressed. It is difficult to imagine the UK becoming protectionist in any meaningful sense, but at the same time, it has a well-developed sense of national and popular sovereignty, and the sense that the two go together – which is why it was so sensitive to the erosion of them through the EU. This means that Britain is unlikely to go to one extreme or the other.In other words, the UK may be the ideal country to find a new balance between openness and integration on the one hand, and a sense of control on the other. If we can find this balance – if we can make Brexit work – the UK could be a model for a wider recalibration of sustainable globalisation. That, rather than fetishising free trade, is the real contribution the UK can make.• Hans Kundnani is a senior research fellow at Chatham House"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5aaf532bbe1795ef6f3eaf6231875612fa01bc41/0_0_2691_1615/master/2691.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce467f255607f1cc40f73c6d095ac5f7","title":"faced with coronavirus covid 19 boris johnston must stop playing invisible man","story":"People want reliable information and reassurance that their government has got a grip: the prime minister must be seen to leadThe coronavirus crisis has sparked a worldwide race against time to try to understand its nature, contain its spread and develop a vaccine. Only in a few remote corners of the planet do people appear to be nonchalantly confident that it can’t get to them. One of those cut-off places is Downing Street. On Friday, Number 10 announced that the prime minister would finally chair a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee, but not until Monday. Nothing must get in the way of Boris Johnson’s weekend. This is of a piece with his behaviour as the spread of the virus has escalated. He has elected to self-isolate indoors rather than take visible charge of the government’s planning and public messaging.Those rebuking his vanishing act include the prime minister’s old frenemy George Osborne, who complained: “The British government now needs to go on to a ‘war footing’ with the coronavirus: daily NHS press briefings, regular Cobra meetings chaired by the PM, ministers on all major media shows. The public is fearful, wants information and needs to know their leaders have got a grip.” You know you are in trouble when the former chancellor is giving advice on crisis management.I think he’s wrong to suggest that most of the public are “fearful”, but he’s right to say that they want reassurance that their government has “got a grip”. In times like these, people have two main demands of their rulers. They crave reliable information that they can act on with confidence. And they want evidence that the government has a plan, or is at least diligently and urgently working on a plan, to deal with the crisis. What they don’t expect is for the occupant of Number 10 to turn himself into the invisible man.The criticism that he has gone absent without leave appears to have stung Mr Johnson at least a little bit. Because he then did pop up to make a brief appearance before TV cameras on Friday evening, after the first fatality of a British citizen had been announced, to declare that responding to Covid-19 was now the government’s “top priority”. Its plan for containment and mitigation will be published early this week.This crisis is testing the resilience of peoples, the competence of their governments and the mettle of leaders around the world. The best find the right balance between giving the public trustworthy guidance and not stoking panic. The challenges to leadership are the greater because the coronavirus presents an unusual cocktail of threats. It is a health hazard accompanied by a menace to the world economy. Financial markets were initially complacent that the contagion would be mostly contained to China, and world growth would quickly rebound in a V-shaped recovery from any setback. Markets are now shaking with fright that the virus will trigger a chain reaction with severe consequences for global growth. Belatedly pricing in the potential hit to trade and company earnings, American and European stock markets have just lurched through their steepest falls since the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered the great crash of 2008. There is a rising chance that the disruption to international supply chains and the suppression of economic activity will tip us into a global recession. Central banks can try to stimulate demand, but they can’t do much to soften a supply shock. This is a threat to this country even if the UK itself manages to avoid an epidemic. For an open economy that is especially dependent on trade flows and finance, there is no vaccine to protect us from economic influenza. If the world catches that cold, Britain will be sneezing with it.Few members of this government know much about viruses. Nearly all do understand the link between the economic climate and how the public feel about their leaders. I detect rising anxiety within ministerial ranks about a global contraction and the havoc that would wreak on their plans and their popularity. Talking to one cabinet minister recently about what might derail this government, he confided: “A recession. That’s what I fear most.” A downturn will make it much harder for the government to deliver on its end-to-austerity spending promises and its pledges not to raise any of the main forms of personal taxation. Damage would be inflicted on living standards, not least among those voters in what we used to call the Labour heartlands who turned to the Tories for the first time at the election.The menace of a virus-induced recession infecting the British economy has large implications for the budget that is due in just 10 days. This had been planned as a boldly defining event in the early life of the Johnson government. Now it will be a budget built on very wobbly foundations. Ministers simply don’t know – and will admit as much in private – what sort of hit there will be on the British economy. Estimates range from the light to the seriously nasty. The neophyte chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and his officials face what one calls “the nightmare” of presenting a budget when all the underpinning assumptions about growth, borrowing, spending and tax revenues have been rendered even more flaky than usual.The spread of the coronavirus also has significant implications for Mr Johnson’s attempt to secure a decent trade deal with the EU. Since London and Brussels published their negotiating strategies, there has been a lot of sabre-rattling from both sides. That was to be expected, but the crisis places a much darker complexion on this Brexit brinkmanship. The spectre of a virus-induced global recession greatly elevates the hazards if the talks fail and will make the price of a no-deal outcome that much more punishing for the British economy.This points us to another thing required of political leadership: a capacity to make tough choices, some of which will be very hard indeed should the UK face a coronavirus epidemic. The constant ministerial mantra is that they are relying on clinical advice to formulate a response that is designed to be both effective and proportionate. Expect to hear a lot more of that when the government publishes its plan. But some decisions are ultimately for the politicians to make and the most testing of them will land on the prime minister’s desk.Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, has delicately hinted at the difficulty of the choices in the worst scenarios. The prime minister and his cabinet will have to make some large decisions about the extent to which normal life is curtailed. Following Japan’s example and closing all schools will take many adults out of the workforce to look after their children. Emulating the Chinese model of shutting down factories, offices, shops, restaurants and transport networks in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus will mean hurting many businesses and the livelihoods of those who work for them. Some firms will go bust. The Swiss have prohibited all gatherings of more than 1,000 people, cancelling the Geneva motor show. The Saudis are banning foreign travellers from visiting the two holiest sites in Islam. Italy has placed several towns in the north under police-controlled quarantine. Other measures can include closing all museums, theatres and cinemas, and cancelling music festivals and sporting fixtures. All of which have knock-on economic effects.As Professor Whitty observes, the prohibition of so many human activities that we normally take for granted would have “non-trivial implications”. The experience of previous viral outbreaks suggests that the biggest impact on economies and incomes will come not from the disease itself but from the responses. There are trade-offs between doing everything a government can to stop the spread of contagion, and the disruption that containment strategies will inflict on economic and social life. The chief medical officer is right to suggest that “we are going to have to have, as a society, a serious discussion about how we manage the trade-offs”.I am going to put the choice more bluntly than he does – or any politician is ever likely to be brave enough to spell out. Should we take every measure available to try to counter the virus and at whatever economic and social cost? Or are we better advised to take less stringent steps to minimise the impact on society, at the price of increasing the risk of infection and, for those most vulnerable to the virus, elevating the risk of death?This is the critical dilemma that is lurking behind many of the calculations and pronouncements by politicians and their advisers. The debate needs to be had honestly and openly. It is a conversation that will need to be led. To govern is to choose. One choice no leader can make at a time of crisis is to hide.• Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0d1ec5788c10333a3e0e6919e4e87c847f0be06/33_188_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=306b8db1b548bb060dfc314c4143bfdd","title":"house of lords debate bbc future director general am dram tate britain british baroque","story":"The House of Lords debate on saving the Beeb is currently a Tory-free zone. Plus, the former lives of Glenda Jackson and Brenda BlethynScrap the licence fee make viewers pay for BBC TV by subscription and sell off most radio stations, excluding Radios 3 and 4. This, according to a page one story of another Sunday broadsheet two weekends ago, is what Downing Street wants. Since then online petitions have been set up to “save” the BBC, and, on 5 March, the Lords will discuss the future of the corporation in a debate initiated by Labour peer Tony Young. Speakers will include Joan Bakewell, Melvyn Bragg and David Puttnam. Two crossbenchers, John Birt, director general from 1992-2000, and historian Peter Hennessy, will also speak, as will a few Lib Dems. But they must avoid sounding like an echo chamber in the upper chamber, simply mouthing niceties about Auntie. And, up to Thursday evening, not a single Tory had put their name down except for the minister for culture and media in the Lords, the appropriately named Baroness Barran, to wind up. Do Conservative peers fear upsetting Boris Johnson? Surely vast numbers of older Tory voters listen to Radio 2 and local radio – all proposed for the chop. One peer interested in the debate is outgoing DG Tony Hall, who tells me he will go to hear the discussion. “But I can’t, of course, speak.”Closing date for applications to succeed Hall is 11 March. Tim Davie, boss of BBC Studios, the Beeb’s commercial arm, is the internal front runner. Charlotte Moore, the very personable “head of content”, will probably throw her hat in. Jay Hunt, once BBC One controller, then head of programmes at Channel 4, and now chief creative officer at Apple, Europe, is an outside probable. If the BBC wants a “disrupter”, the abrasive Hunt is perfect. I also expect that Carolyn Fairbairn, DG of the CBI and a former senior BBC exec, will apply. She could cope, too, with the “low” salary of £450,000 as her husband is a multimillionaire property developer. Her only problem might be that the CBI itself was very pro-Remain, which might go against her. Interestingly, the chair of the company recruiting for the DG job is the former Tory cabinet minister Virginia Bottomley.Glenda Jackson once worked in a pharmacy while a member of a Cheshire amateur dramatics society Brenda Blethyn was a secretary as well as one of British Rail’s Euston Players and Anthony Hopkins attended a Welsh YMCA acting group.

Ian McKellen is quoted in Questors, Jesters and Renegades, to be published by Methuen on 5 March, on am-dram’s importance in local communities. “There is something honourable too about people giving their spare time after work to put on a play,” he says.Two weeks ago I wrote of a new notice outside Tate Britain’s British Baroque exhibition, warning that some paintings “depict black people in a demeaning way. For more information, ask a visitor assistant.” It has now been altered to: “There are some distressing images of enslaved people. If you prefer not to see them, speak to a visitor assistant, who will show you an alternative route.” Why?

First comes disbelief and denial. Next, progressive revelation that the threat is real and that it’s spreading. The final act is crisis, followed by recrimination and the search for scapegoats.Judging by the events of the past seven days, we are now in full coronavirus crisis mode. On Wednesday, as some British schools sent pupils who had recently visited Italy home while others elected to stay open, headteachers accused Public Health England of issuing “confusing and contradictory” advice to parents.And there is panic too. Almost £100bn was wiped off the value of the FTSE 100 in just two days of trading on Monday and Tuesday. And on Wednesday the oil giant Chevron instructed 300 staff to stay away from its Canary Wharf headquarters after an employee developed flu-like symptoms following his return from Italy, even though the official government advice is that there is no need to close workplaces. Meanwhile, in Milan, which lies outside the quarantine zone, supermarket shelves have been stripped of pasta and fresh vegetables by worried shoppers, and museums and other public buildings are shut.So how concerned should we be about Sars-CoV-2, as the virus is formally known? Does the government have a coherent plan to mitigate the worst impacts of what increasingly looks like a pandemic? And what can the experience of previous pandemics tell us about how best to respond to this one? Fifteen years ago, while researching my book Living With Enza, I asked similar questions. Then, south-east Asia was in the midst of a major outbreak of bird flu and there was a panic about a possible pandemic of H5N1 avian influenza.The last time a species of bird flu had triggered a major pandemic was in 1918-19 when the so-called Spanish flu had encircled the globe, killing 50 million people worldwide, the majority of the victims being adults between the ages of 20 and 40. In 1918 there were no antibiotics or antiviral drugs to mitigate the severity of the infection, and no vaccine to prevent the virus’s transmission, so deaths were off the scale. Nevertheless, in 2005, David Nabarro, the United Nations coordinator for avian and human influenza, warned that the H5N1 virus might result in the loss of anywhere “from 5 million to 150 million lives” globally.In the event, the pandemic never happened and by 2009 just 282 people worldwide had died of H5N1. Instead, it was a novel strain of swine flu, emerging unexpectedly in Mexico in the spring of 2009, that sparked the next pandemic. Then as now, there was panic: in response to a statement from England’s then chief medical officer that as many as 65,000 Britons might die, the National Pandemic Flu service crashed. We also saw the same debates about the utility of face masks and the same public health messages about the importance of covering one’s mouth when coughing and sneezing. And while some schools closed, others remained open.Just 457 Britons died in the swine flu pandemic. While that is about twice as many who die in a normal winter flu season, it prompted many people to ask what all the fuss had been about. Some politicians, noting how the World Health Organization’s pandemic declaration had been a windfall for vaccine manufacturers, even described swine flu as a “fake pandemic”.It is to avoid being accused of provoking a similar “scare” that the WHO is being so careful this time round. Hence, the refusal of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director general, to use the p-word, even as the coronavirus threatens to overwhelm global supply chains and send stock markets plunging to new lows. Instead, we have had talk of “a potential pandemic” and of windows “narrowing”.At a press briefing in London on Tuesday, infectious disease experts, many of whom advise the government, were similarly close-lipped. There was no point getting “hung up” on the term pandemic, said one. The important thing was for PHE and other national bodies to continue with measures to mitigate and contain the spread of the virus. Nor would anyone comment on how many Britons might be infected should the coronavirus begin spreading more widely, much less how many might die.In 1918, as now, British health officials adopted a laissez-faire attitude to the Spanish flu. Then, as now, the official advice was to cover your mouth when coughing and sneezing, and isolate yourself at home if sick. The question of whether or not to close schools was left to the discretion of local authorities. Keen to reinforce morale on the home front, British newspapers also underplayed the threat, with the Times telling its readers that fear was “the mother of infection” and that “to go about expecting influenza is to invite it”. Meanwhile, Arthur Newsholme, the head of the Local Government Board and the highest medical officer in the land, said the needs of war demanded that Britons “carry on”.Expect a similar business-as-usual message this week when the government unveils its public awareness campaign. People will be urged to cover up sneezes and coughs, wash their hands for up to 20 seconds and self-isolate at home and dial 111 if sick. To reduce the burden on GPs, the NHS is trialling “drive-through” coronavirus testing at select London health centres. The key message will be “protect yourself and protect others”.What you won’t hear is any reference to projected casualties or whether the NHS has sufficient critical care beds if mitigation fails and we have to step up the response to Chinese levels. The good news is that while the virus has spread to at least 50 countries worldwide, cases in China are declining, suggesting that the draconian quarantines in place in Wuhan and other Chinese cities since January are working. The bad news is that, unlike influenza, to which everyone has some immunity, no one has immunity to Covid-19. And we still don’t know whether it can be spread by people without symptoms or what percentage of those who require hospitalisation for severe respiratory illness will die.What we do know is that despite quarantines and travel bans, the coronavirus has spread to every continent on the globe with the exception of Antarctica in just three months. In many ways, it’s the perfect predator: most people do not know they’re infected until it’s too late. And while the elderly appear to be more susceptible to severe illness and death than people in younger age ranges, some of the victims have been in their 30s. That is not necessarily a reason to be afraid, but it is reason to take the coronavirus seriously.• Mark Honigsbaum is a medical historian and author of The Pandemic Century: One Hundred Years of Panic, Hysteria and Hubris"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b8242e1431d995834904c6d3f4f85bf66616f7b/0_315_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed5d4327dd5e56a33b19a95e27794034","title":"rishi sunak free ports thatcherism","story":"Instead of ‘levelling up’ the economy, they would entrench the power of corporations and deepen market competitionIn 2016, a little-known Conservative MP authored a paper for the Centre for Policy Studies, the free-market thinktank founded by Keith Joseph and Margaret Thatcher. Looking ahead to Britain’s post-Brexit future, the report argued, the government should seize the opportunity to create a string of free ports across the country to revive manufacturing. These engines of economic growth would reconnect Britain with its “proud maritime history” and act as a “beacon of British values”. The MP in question was Rishi Sunak.Four years later, Britain has left the EU, Sunak has been promoted to chancellor of the exchequer, and Boris Johnson is shaping the direction of Britain’s economy. If Johnsonism, as Ferdinand Mount writes, “is not a continuation of Thatcherism at all”, Sunak’s 2016 proposal should make us wonder. His recent plan for free ports, based on the 2016 report, reheats an idea that first gained prominence under Thatcher’s government, and reeks of precisely the free-market ideas from which the new government is supposedly distancing itself.Though the Conservative party’s post-Brexit economic worldview has often been likened to “Singapore-on-Thames”, Sunak’s vision is more Tennessee-on-Tyne. Free ports most resemble the foreign trade zones that have existed in the US since the 1930s, where goods aren’t subject to tariffs until (and if) they cross over into the domestic market. US free trade zones work because of conditions the UK doesn’t share, including higher tariffs on car parts that make it cheaper for companies to manufacture finished cars in US free trade zones.Sober observers of the free port policy realise the difficulties that the UK would have in making a success of it. One consultant, Neil Davidson, reminded MPs in 2019 that the UK actually had five free ports until 2012. It allowed them to lapse because there was no advantage to be gained beyond the considerable advantages the UK already enjoyed from its EU membership.But the real utility of free ports may in fact be ideological. They are reminiscent of the free-market enterprise zones policy that first gained popularity during the Thatcher era, the unlikely brainchild of anarchist city planner Peter Hall and Thatcher’s longest-serving cabinet minister, Geoffrey Howe. Michael Heseltine helped set up enterprise zones in places such as Corby, Wakefield, Liverpool and the Isle of Dogs in London. By freeing discrete areas of the city from regulations and taxes, they were ostensibly intended to cut red tape and unleash grassroots entrepreneurship – exposing the limitations of top-down state investment in the process. Yet their legacy was mixed. Total net employment benefits were small, and the policy was costly.Speaking to the US libertarian thinktank the Heritage Foundation in 1980, the historian Paul Johnson described the zones as a “dagger aimed at the heart of socialism”. The “localised freedom” of low taxes and deregulation, wrote Stuart Butler, a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, can “act like a benign cancer”, rotting “the foundations of the unfree state around it”. In 1980s Britain, the benefits of enterprise zones flowed largely to property investors. One of their success stories was the Isle of Dogs, an area that exemplifies the lopsided growth and extremes of inequality that Johnson’s government seeks to level out.A slowdown in the global economy since 2008 has led nation states across the world to offer ever-more inducements to would-be corporate investors. The world is full of zones designed for this purpose – nearly 5,400 by the latest estimates, with 1,000 new zones appearing in the last five years. In many cases, the zonification of the Earth has led to what critics long feared: a race to the bottom. Free trade zones splinter the world into jurisdictions engaged in a constant competition to attract multinational companies, locking nations into a global “place war” to offer businesses the most enticing incentives and the lowest labour costs.In some places, the exemptions granted to businesses in free trade zones have ripped important rules to ribbons. In Bangladesh, the Chittagong free zone banned strikes and reportedly paid workers less than the minimum wage, while in a free zone in the Philippines, state police battled with private security guards over government plans to enact health and safety regulations. The attraction of free zones for corporations is clear: trade state bureaucracy for your own rules. Free zones make tax, labour law and health and safety regulations into a service that companies can opt out of.This is perhaps the most plausible way to understand the free ports strategy. Rather than “level up” the UK as a tool of economic policy, their real agenda may be to deepen an ethos of market competition, entrench the power of corporations and reinvent Thatcherism, Johnson-style, for the 2020s.• Quinn Slobodian is a historian and author of Globalists: The End of Empire and the Birth of Neoliberalism"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cc4784cd15ac5570a5a96c642014efb2836d980/96_0_2307_1384/master/2307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61a080c7b7367de6dc59328bde91b640","title":"children reading less says new research","story":"Just a quarter of under-18s read each day, study shows in run-up to World Book DayChildren today read less frequently than any previous generation and enjoy reading less than young people did in the past, according to new research.World Book Day, a charity event held annually in the UK and Ireland, will this year call on readers of all ages to “share a million stories” by reading aloud or listening to a story for at least 10 minutes a day with friends and family.World Book Day chief executive Cassie Chadderton said this activity can turn a reluctant reader into a child who reads for pleasure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95a64e7b7214eddc131437b776daf39de3e97c89/0_170_5241_3146/master/5241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d38cd206813c94207a18672ade226ebe","title":"teachers call action state nursery schools","story":"Critics say years of neglect and indecision by the government have left a funding deficitState nurseries in Britain are facing a financial crisis after years of “unjustifiable neglect” and indecision by the government, teachers warn as they prepare to petition the prime minister to “save maintained nursery schools”.Headteachers, parents and children will gather at Downing Street on Monday to hand in a petition calling for increased state funding for nurseries to secure their long-term future.Maintained nurseries are run and inspected like schools, with qualified teachers leading a team of early years specialists, but do not have the same funding entitlements as schools and are therefore facing a funding deficit.The National Education Union (NEU) says these nurseries will lose an estimated third of their budget when short-term funding commitments – a “stopgap” measure started in 2017 – expire in April 2021.Mary Bousted, NEU joint general secretary, said the lack of clarity about long-term funding meant nurseries were in crisis. “Heads of maintained nurseries are hanging on by their fingernails,” she said.She added that the majority of maintained nurseries are “beacons of excellence” in deprived areas, and their closure would hit vulnerable and disadvantaged families. “These are exactly the areas that Boris Johnson and this government talk about in terms of levelling up. Well, one of the best ways they can level up is by keeping these nurseries going and well-funded ... I think it’s an act of unjustifiable neglect.”Rachel Gillet, head of two maintained nurseries in Warwickshire, said: “I have moments when I’m looking at a deficit I can’t close because I’ve taken all the measures I can to cut costs. I have to sit in the sandpit and watch the children, and remember exactly what I’m fighting for.”She added that it is difficult to recruit high-quality staff because she can only offer temporary contracts. “It’s frustrating. I’m passionate about early education, and I do wonder why I’m still having to make the argument for it.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We recognise the importance of maintained nursery schools … particularly in disadvantaged areas. We are providing around £60m of supplementary funding during the 2020-21 financial year.”The government was committed to funding maintained nurseries in the longer term, she said, but declined to comment on how much funding the government will provide beyond the 2020-21 financial year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/801574d804e937a790ae5a1f322bea82c96afbb6/540_142_1474_884/master/1474.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86a2a9d204b593e0712ba2db28495e54","title":"50 ways to green up your life save the planet","story":"Expert tips on how to be kinder to the planet – from cooking and cleaning to fashion and financeLove your leftoversLook at what basics you’re binning. “Chefs talk about what to do with carrot tops or whey from cheese, but that’s not where we need to make changes,” says Feast food writer Anna Jones. “It’s the milk poured down the sink and stale bread – the items we don’t put as much value on.” Jones tears up bread to freeze for instant croutons, or whizzes it into breadcrumbs for adding to croustades, pastas and salads. If oats have already been made into porridge, follow Claire Thomson, chef and author of The Art Of The Larder (Quadrille, £25), and substitute for some of the flour and water in bread dough.Treat “food waste” as ingredients, says Ollie Hunter, chef and author of 30 Easy Ways To Join The Food Revolution (Pavilion, £14.99). “It’s easy to turn it into something else aquafaba (chickpea water) can be made into a vegan mayonnaise fry squash seeds in oil and sprinkle with salt for a snack cut courgette stalks into penne shapes and cook like pasta. You need to find creative ways to use everything up wasting food is down to a lack of imagination.”Use tech for goodApps are taking the fight to food waste. Olio connects neighbours and local retailers so surplus food can be shared Too Good To Go enables cafes and restaurants to sell uneaten meals at reduced rates while Farmdrop connects you with sustainable local farmers. To recycle kitchen scraps, find neighbours with a compost bin (or chickens) at sharewaste.Shop little and oftenA lot of waste comes from doing big shops, putting two-for-one “bargains” in the trolley and buying on repeat rather than planning meals. “I’m always clear about what we will eat at home and when,” says Skye Gyngell, chef and founder of Spring in London, which runs a “scratch menu” using waste. She shops little and often, supported by a store cupboard of wholegrains, olive oil, vinegars and mustards to bolster meals. “Working out what kind of cook you are is also useful,” says Jones, “then reverse engineer how you shop. There is no point doing a weekly shop if you like to decide what you’re going to make for dinner at 6pm, like me. I shop in small increments, and I find I waste less this way, too.”Pick your own“Foraging solves many problems,” Hunter says. “You’re getting into the countryside, engaging with nature and the community, and finding food that has a different flavour.” Start with herbs, grasses, berries, wild garlic and, a favourite of Hunter’s, nettles (“They’re so underrated”). Use to garnish pies, in risottos and soups wear gloves to avoid stings and wash thoroughly in salted water. Ensure foraged ingredients are identifiable before eating – check woodlandtrust.org or wildfooduk.Switch your floursCrops can’t be grown every year in the same soil without replacing nutrients taken by the plants, and switching the flour you use can help. “Spelt or wheat is often grown in rotation with rye and clover to replace lost nitrogen,” says Hunter. “Eating rye supports the farmers’ rotation I use spelt and emmer flour as an alternative to wheat because they have similar baking properties, while being beneficial to the soil.”Befriend a butcher“There is no way around it, eating meat sustainably requires a little more effort on our part,” says Fergus Henderson, chef and godfather of nose-to-tail eating. His first rule is to “hug” your butcher: “Support them and ask questions – they are your way in to a positive supply chain. They will also give you access to the insides and extremities, such as kidneys, shanks, feet and glands, which offer so much more possibility and flavour than the fillet.” Whole-animal eating is not about blood and guts, but “respecting the animal enough to realise that, if it has died for you, the least you can do is make use of every part”. Compost on the goCompost isn’t just for the garden – think about reducing your food waste when you’re on the go, too, says Lindsay Miles, whose book Less Waste, No Fuss Kitchen: Simple Steps To Shop, Cook And Eat Sustainably (Hardie Grant, £12.99) is out in June. “A reusable coffee cup makes a great impromptu container for your lunch scraps – take apple cores or bread crusts home to compost.”Plan aheadMake the most of seasonal gluts and preserve vegetables in oils, vinegars, chutneys, ketchup and marinades, or freeze them. “Blitz and freeze tomatoes in containers for passata all year round make kimchi from cauliflower stalks and leaves use beetroot in jams, vinegars and oil, then chop stalks and leaves to top pastas, pizzas, curries and dal,” says Hunter.Minimise packagingLook for loose fruit and vegetables, and take your own containers to shops and markets. “If you are buying packaged food,” says Miles, “look at where the product comes from and try to choose the more local option – oat milk from Scotland will have a lower carbon footprint than almond milk from California, even if they have the same packaging.” The most recyclable plastics are PET, found in drinks bottles and fruit punnets, and HDPE, in milk bottles and cereal box liners so if you can’t avoid it, go for these, then reuse or recycle what you can.Clean with castileBy making cleaning products (from polish to detergent) you can reduce the amount of plastic entering your home and the level of harmful VOCs (volatile organic compounds), such as formaldehyde, that are released. “Of all the green cleaning ingredients I use, liquid castile soap is by far my favourite,” writes Jen Chillingsworth in Clean Green (Quadrille, £7.55). “Originating from Spain, castile soap was traditionally made with pure olive oil, but is now more commonly produced by mixing vegetable oils such as hemp, avocado, jojoba and coconut.” For a simple, multipurpose kitchen spray, add 50ml of castile soap to 800ml tap water in a spray bottle. Add a few drops of essential oils (tea tree is antibacterial). Spray and wipe with a clean cloth.Go for plastic-free personal careThere is a world of waste-free sanitary protection to explore, and Chillingsworth suggests buying a reusable tampon applicator. “The reusable version fits every size of tampon, is antimicrobial and easy to insert. After use, give it a wipe, rinse and return to the storage box that fits in your handbag. Sterilise in hot water between periods.”Recycle as much as you can“Most major supermarkets provide plastic recycling collection points in store for stretchy plastic (such as frozen food bags, carrier bags and bread bags) which normally can’t be recycled from home,” says Helen Bird, plastics expert at government waste advisory body Wrap.TerraCycle rescues hard-to-recycle waste that is not processed by councils. It has free national recycling programmes and also sells zero-waste boxes, which you can fill with most non-hazardous, non-recyclable and non-organic waste, and return for recycling. Search its website for a scheme near you, or set one up. Look after your electrical appliancesThe Restart Project is a social enterprise that aims to fix our relationship with electricals and electronics. Cofounder Janet Gunter says the first step in keeping household appliances for longer is regular cleaning. “By simply cleaning and maintaining your white goods, laptop or mobile, you will prolong its life.” Restart runs a nationwide network of skill-sharing workshops as well as promoting a directory of commercial repair options in London. (See also repaircafe.org for events in your area.) “If we don’t have access to spare parts,” says Gunter, “these appliances will be thrown away, which has a huge carbon impact.” If your electrical appliance really is beyond repair, Rhoads suggests you “call the manufacturer or company of purchase to see if they will take back items or packaging for reuse or recycling”. Not all charity shops accept electrical items, but the homelessness charity Emmaus accepts working items. These are tested before being resold, which makes it a good place to purchase secondhand electrical goods, too.Create clean air“You can never have enough house plants,” says Oliver Heath, who runs a sustainable architecture practice. Certain plants are best for certain rooms: “Mother-in-law’s tongue gives off oxygen at night, which makes it best suited to the bedroom.” According to Chillingsworth, peace lilies and boston ferns thrive in rooms with high humidity and can reduce the mould spores in the air, making them ideal for bathrooms weeping figs have been found to be the best plant for removing formaldehyde released from carpets and furniture, making them good for living areas.Change your shower head“Investing in an aerated shower head will make a significant difference to energy and water consumption,” says Brian Horne at the Energy Saving Trust (EST). They inject air into the water stream, limiting water usage. “A water-efficient shower head could save a four-person household £70 a year on gas for water heating, and a further £115 on water bills if they have a meter,” says Horne. Opt for green energy suppliersThere are “shades of green” when it comes to choosing an energy supplier, says Horne. The EST identified four suppliers who clearly listed the renewable sources of their energy on their websites last year: Green Energy UK, Good Energy, Ecotricity and Octopus Energy. “But just because you’re on a green tariff, it doesn’t mean you should stop worrying about how much energy you use,” says Horne.Draught-proof your homeOne of the cheapest, most effective ways to save energy and money at home is to draught-proof windows, doors, letterbox, fireplaces and loft hatches, says Dr Sarah Price, head of building physics at Enhabit, a consultancy specialising in low-energy design. Done professionally, it costs about £200, or do it yourself with products such as Gap Seal.Buy vintage furniture“Reusing furniture is the best thing to do, and so much more fun than buying new,” says Nicola Harding, founder of interior design studio Harding and Read. “Secondhand items come with interesting stories and force you to think creatively, and give you have something far more unique.” To keep mileage down, start at your local auction houses and charity shops (the British Heart Foundation has dedicated home stores and a free collection service), followed by a targeted trawl through Freecycle and Facebook Marketplace. Alternatively, grow your own flowers to bring indoors. Gardener Sarah Raven suggests going for “annuals which are cut and come again: pick above a pair of leaves and the plant will spring back and produce more flowers – and keep on doing so as long as you keep picking”. Sow cosmos, snapdragons, zinnias and rudbeckias on a sunny window ledge in March, pot on and plant out after the last frosts.Encourage beesHoneybees visit only one type of flower in any one foraging trip, says Sarah Wyndham Lewis, author of Planting For Honeybees: The Grower’s Guide To Creating A Buzz. “This is called ‘flower fidelity’ and is what makes them such effective pollinators. So plant large clumps or ‘drifts’ of single species and optimise each of the bees’ trips.” Think swathes of catmint, field scabious and hyssop. “March to September are the key months for honeybees – they will fly whenever the temperature is above 10C, even in winter, so early- and late-flowering plants are especially valuable,” she says. Spend less, propagate moreYour own plot is the best garden centre there is: collect seed, learn to take cuttings and ide plants to stock your own backup nursery. Gaps can then be filled with home‑propagated stock plants. Increase what does well in your garden to build a healthy community of plants. If you do go shopping, research a plant’s natural habitat to reduce failures. Lock up carbonIn The Garden Jungle, Or Gardening To Save The Planet (out in paperback 2 April, Vintage, £9.99), Dave Goulson explains that although many gardeners don’t have room for large trees, “The basic rule is that the more vegetation you have, the more carbon you are storing.” So the fuller the planting in your garden, the better, even if it verges on overgrown. Don’t be too tidy, either. “Log piles also lock up carbon for as long as it takes them to decay, which can be many years.” Let the grass growLetting your grass grow longer between cuts not only saves petrol or electricity, and therefore reduces carbon dioxide emissions, but also encourages more wildlife into your garden. Longer grass is more drought-resistant, too. Try cutting every three or four weeks and let dandelions, daisies and violets bloom in spring, followed by buttercups, clovers and selfheal in summer.Encourage hedgehogsHedgehogs have a voracious appetite for pests such as caterpillars, slugs and snails. They need easy access in and out of gardens, say Helen Bostock and Sophie Collins, authors of How Can I Help Hedgehogs? (Octopus, £14.99). They recommend that neighbours get together to arrange hedgehog holes between gardens. “This is simply a hole cut into the bottom of a fence – it should be around 13cm high and at least as wide, preferably in a sheltered corner.”Set a barIf a year without buying anything new seems too big a challenge, try a month, or buy only secondhand. Livia Firth, founder of sustainability consultancy Eco-Age, follows the “30 wears rule”: ask, “Will I wear it at least 30 times?” before buying.Find a secondhand that works for youOpting for vintage or secondhand is one of the easiest ways to shop sustainably, but while some fans will extol the virtues of rifling through giant warehouses, this approach is not for everyone. Thankfully, there are other ways. Smaller stores with a curated selection may not offer quite the same bargains as a car boot sale, but they can be less intimidating. Many, such as Paper Dress Vintage or Cow, also have websites.Shop in person – and aloneThat said, shopping in person – especially if you walk there – is usually greener than online. Clothes shipped across the world have a significant carbon footprint, and often come packaged in plastic. You are also less likely to return things you have tried on.It can help to ditch your friends. “When you ask a friend if you should buy something, you already know the answer will be yes,” writes Lauren Bravo in How To Break Up With Fast Fashion (Headline, £12.99). “It’s an unwritten rule of sisterhood.” Think of it as the new version of not going supermarket shopping when you’re hungry.Choose materials wiselySome fabrics age better than others the ’s styling editor, Melanie Wilkinson, recommends looking for leather when shopping secondhand. Leather jackets, shoes and belts last for years and often look and feel better once they have been worn in. The environmental impact of denim – another durable fabric – means jeans are also best bought secondhand.Unsubscribe and unfollow“If someone wants to quit fast fashion, I recommend unsubscribing from all the emails,” says writer and fashion consultant Aja Barber. “A brand that is constantly introducing new products might be sustainable in name only. Sending emails and pressuring consumers to buy, buy, buy is not sustainability – that’s fast fashion.” The same goes for influencers and brands on social platforms such as Instagram. Deleting fast-fashion shopping apps can help, too.Get swishingClothes swaps – known as swishing – are one of the greenest ways to refresh your wardrobe. They offer credits based on the value of the items you bring, which can be swapped for items brought by others. Avoid trends and hunt for quality pieces you’ll wear for years. Find one near you at swishing.Make your clothes fitLayla Sargent, founder of The Seam, a website to connect you with local tailors, seamstresses and embroidery artists, says: “If it doesn’t fit well, you’re never going to wear it. Even by making trousers just the right length, or altering a waistband slightly, we will be inclined to wear them more.” The service is currently only in the London area, but coming to Manchester and Birmingham this year. Meanwhile, start with your local dry cleaner.Make your own apron from a pair of old jeansTurn a pair of old jeans into a denim work apron by unpicking the inside leg seams and stitching them together. This is one of many hacks from The Great British Sewing Bee’s book on Sustainable Style (Quadrille, £27, published on 26 March).Darn your socks“Once a life skill, darning has skipped a generation (or two),” says Emma Mathews of Socko (socko.shop), which makes socks from repurposed yarn. “But we can learn a lot from the way things were done in the past.” Sew small running stitches up and down the area around the hole and then turn the repair around and stitch perpendicular to them, weaving the thread together until you have covered the hole. Highly therapeutic.Primp your trainersThis is a growing service industry. Gråel in Liverpool is a small business that specialises in cleaning “coveted footwear”, offering laces cleaning (£3), a deep clean (£15) and the meticulous premium package from undersole to insole (£35). Meanwhile, Jason Markk offers premium shoe care from branches in LA and Carnaby Street in London, where your trainers will be brought back to life by the brand’s sneaker-care technicians.Lose the disposablesA staggering 20,000 litres of water are needed to create only 1kg of cotton – that’s enough to make just one T-shirt and a pair of jeans, so any cotton you buy should count. Replacing cotton wool is a good start. Remove the initial bulk of makeup with a reusable disc, such as Face Halo (£7), soaked in plain water. These do an astoundingly good job, even on waterproof mascara. Follow with a cleanser and a wet terry-cotton flannel both flannel and disc should last for hundreds of washing machine cycles. For toners, exfoliants and nail polish remover, use washable bamboo pads. A pack of 18, plus washbag, costs about £10.Don’t be tempted by minisThose pick’n’mix bars of travel-sized beauty products are so alluring, but cause a huge amount of waste for no reason and very little product. Instead, make a one-off investment in refillable travel bottles and pots from Muji (from 95p) or any high street chemist, and decant your favourite full sizes – or, even better, wash out and reuse any mini bottles you already have. Remember that active skincare such as vitamin C or retinol serums are best left in their original packaging to safeguard their stability, but anything else can be decanted for travel. And if you have so many minis left over from flights and hotel stays that you won’t use them all, take them to your nearest homeless shelter, where their clients need them.Embrace bathsBaths have long been seen as more wasteful and less responsible than showering, but some research shows that modern, pumped power showers can use more, not less, water than bathing. It is possible to enjoy a luxurious, but environmentally considerate, bath. Use sulphate-free oils, salts or foams and relax (I’ve even been known to wash posh, delicate bras while I soak). You can save more water by washing hair over the bath before climbing in, allowing the water to fill the tub – the shampoo will create bubbles, too.Save water and lower your billsConsider switching to a water meter, so you pay for only the water you use. Invest the money you save into water-saving devices and plumbing, such as rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling systems. Get free water-saving products from savewatersavemoney. If you live in England and Wales, you can get a water meter fitted for free, but you may need to pay £300 if you live in Scotland. A number of investment funds have clean water and sanitation as their dominant theme, says Becky O’Connor of Royal London. For example, Parvest Aqua and RobecoSam Sustainable Water are recommended by ethical financial website good-with-money.Get a loan to improve your home’s energy efficiencySome lenders provide cheap green mortgages and loans for energy-efficient improvements. Ecology Building Society offers discounts to customers borrowing for this. Nationwide says it will start offering low-interest loans of up to £25,000 to homeowners who want to retrofit existing properties with energy-efficiency measures.Choose an environmentally friendly current accountNearly £150bn has been invested in fossil fuels by UK banks since the Paris climate agreement was adopted in 2016. Ethical bank Triodos, which has the backing of Friends of the Earth, invests only in projects that create positive cultural, social and environmental outcomes. To review your bank’s track record, see lobbying organisation BankTrack, which reports on the activities that banks finance worldwide.Invest wisely“Look at funds with sustainability in mind,” says Alice Evans, co-head of the BMO Global Investment’s responsible investment team. “Invest in funds that are described as ‘responsible’, ‘SRI’ (socially responsible investment), ‘ethical’ or ‘dark green’. These have the strictest criteria and avoid investing in any company that may have a poor record on environmental, human rights or other ethical grounds.” Evaluate your pension“For many people, their workplace pension will be their largest investment,” says Rich Mayor of research and analysis company Fundscape. You have the right to know where your money is being invested. “Ask your HR department or pension provider what funds you’re invested in and whether there is a sustainable or ethical option,” says Jon Dean, head of retirement strategy for financial services consultancy Altus.Get a green financial adviserLast year, a new financial advice firm called The Path was set up to invest only in portfolios that have a positive impact on the planet. “You don’t need to be a millionaire to invest your money wisely,” says founder David MacDonald. “With very little effort you can make a significant difference, moving from harming the planet with your money to sustaining it.” Some research suggests that making sure your investments are sustainable has 27 times more impact than all the other things you could do to reduce your carbon footprint added together. “If you put the maximum annual ISA contribution of £20,000 into a positive-impact fund, it would be the carbon equivalent of taking one car off the road,” MacDonald says.• If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2df1cee657f19b4c6c008a5109cccbac19ae83ff/0_0_2800_1654/master/2800.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7a0deca2a8cf431d7777174a84f6867d 1760w","title":"tell us have you not bought clothes for more than 10 years","story":"We’re interested in hearing from people who haven’t bought any clothes for the last 10 years Konnie Huq has revealed that she hasn’t bought any clothes in 10 years.

Based on Peter Carey’s 2001 Booker prize-winning novel, it splits Kelly’s story into three parts: “Boy”, “Man” and “Monitor”, the third chapter referring to his time as a self-appointed bush ranger. Orlando Schwerdt plays the young Kelly, innocence soured having seen too much, while British actor George MacKay is his unruly adult counterpart.Kurzel begins the film with an image of Kelly writing a letter to his unborn child (it was a myth that Kelly was illiterate). “Every man should be the author of his own history,” instructs his mentor, Harry Power (Russell Crowe). And so the Adelaide-born Kurzel playfully rewrites one of his country’s most persistent cultural figures, adding a homoerotic subtext that undermines the idea of Kelly as a macho folk hero. This Kelly is motivated by an oedipal complex and wears dresses to distract his opponents The Babadook’s Essie Davis is equal parts fearsome and magnetic as his enterprising sex worker mother.

Instead it was devastation for Arsenal on the final whistle, though they may take a little consolation from the words of the opposing manager.Emma Hayes said: “The better team did not win the game the most resilient team won the game, and I value defending, and I value resilience.”Sloppy Arsenal defending had allowed England to give Chelsea the lead inside 10 minutes, but Williamson sent the Arsenal bench wild when their heavy spell of pressure looked to have paid off and delivered extra time. This, though, is a Chelsea team that never say die, having come from behind nine times in the Women’s Super League, and up popped England to earn them their first ever League Cup.“We knew that this would be a dominant Arsenal, so to win the game knowing that shows what a great team we really are,” said Hayes, who also singled out Chelsea’s goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger for praise.“She was unbelievable,” said Hayes. “We always talk about attacking being the most dominant feature of a football match instead of saying why don’t Chelsea deserve to win the game on the basis of an outstanding goalkeeping performance. It’s not often we have to defend like that.”When the team sheet arrived there was concern for Arsenal fans. Joe Montemurro could name only four outfield players on his bench, including two 17-year-olds and a 16-year-old. Injuries to Beth Mead, Jen Beattie Lia Wälti and the captain, Kim Little, have devastated Arsenal’s squad.There was a sense of deja vu to the narrative. With Montemurro’s penchant for a small squad rocked by a freak injury crisis last season, Arsenal travelled to Bramall Lane for a backs-against-the-wall battle with Manchester City. Then, the unfit Vivianne Miedema was the only senior outfield player seated alongside the manager. This time it was the defender Leonie Maier who could provide the best depth from the dugout.Arsenal were hit by an eighth-minute sucker-punch as left-back Jonna Andersson found right-back Maren Mjelde at the far post. Mjelde headed down to England, who swivelled and struck low past Manuela Zinsberger.However, this was not an Arsenal side likely to buckle as easily as they did at Borehamwood in January, where a 4-1 bruising was kickstarted by a flurry of three goals inside 20 minutes. In a chilly City Ground, Montemurro had ditched his attempt to outfox Hayes by dropping his wingers for a more centrally focused attack, instead restoring much more familiar width to their forward play. It worked.“It could have been a different story,” said Montemurro. “We were badly beaten at Borehamwood. And look at the mental attitude to come back and completely dominate a team that did what they did to us.”Despite their lead, Chelsea looked to be losing the midfield battle. So much so that Hayes could be seen passing notes to Mjelde late in the first half.Perhaps it was emotions getting in the way. This was Chelsea’s first League Cup final and, with Hayes donning a green coat in tribute to idol Brian Clough as promised, it was a title they badly wanted. “The players haven’t got a clue who he is. My sister sent me lists of quotes this morning, my favourite one being this one, she sent me it twice so clearly she wanted me to read it out to you guys: ‘I wouldn’t say I’m the best manager in the business but I’m in the top one.’ Well, I’m there today. I’ll take that,” said Hayes.This is a competition that has been kind to five-time winners Arsenal, and to Montemurro, who lifted it within three months of taking over in 2017. “There are no second chances,” he had said in his programme notes. “The team that controls their emotions and tempo the best will make the least mistakes and most likely win.”They would be words to haunt the manager. Despite the Arsenal forward line flooding the Chelsea half over and over again, the equaliser that would amend for the ropey defending that had allowed England in early on seemed elusive.However, after a lengthy pause for an injury to Berger, Arsenal bounced the resulting corner into the box for Williamson to ert from six yards. It was a short-lived celebration though, with England poking in Mjelde’s cross to kill the Arsenal comeback.“A lot of coaches say: we should have, could have, would have,” said Montemurro. “But in the end, you have to do it. We created chances, we created opportunities, and in the end they scored the ones they created and we didn’t. This team will keep fighting – we showed that today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e5ca6d7260a2ae3320d8e7a70bb1ae271e2df7a/111_0_4225_2536/master/4225.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=922c000be6dec2efffe746d46bb52257","title":"watford liverpool premier league match report","story":"A sense of inevitability characterises Liverpool’s pursuit of the title but no longer is it one cloaked in invincibility. Yes, that’s right, Jürgen Klopp’s men have lost a Premier League game, 423 days since they last did so, and in a manner that was so complete that its unfolding felt like an almighty trick of the mind. Was this really happening? Was a side that had won their last 18 league games and maintained a 22-point lead at the top of the table really utterly out-thought, outfought and outplayed by opponents fighting relegation? Indeed they were, and then some.Quite simply Liverpool were battered. From first minute until last Watford refused to display any sense of an inferiority complex against esteemed opponents and instead delivered a display of great togetherness, aggression and potency. They scored three and could have had more on a night that will be spoken about in these parts for years to come. That much could be taken from the thunderous roar that greeted the final whistle from the majority of those in attendance. A famous victory for Watford’s supporters to celebrate and one that also lifts their side out of the bottom three on goal difference and gives them renewed belief they can avoid the drop after all.There was no doubting their best performer, either. Making his first start since 18 January having been sidelined with a hamstring injury, Ismaïla Sarr was sensational, scoring Watford’s first two goals, assisting Troy Deeney for the third and generally tormenting Liverpool with his pace, skill and intent from the right wing. The 22-year-old, who joined Watford from Rennes for £25m in the summer, earned a standing ovation from the home fans when substituted on 82 minutes as well as praise from his manager. “He’s a really good player,” said Nigel Pearson in his typically understated manner.Others in yellow and black also caught the eye, most notably Will Hughes and Abdoulaye Doucouré in midfield and Gerard Deulofeu up until he had to be substituted on 37 minutes after twisting his knee while challenging Virgil van Dijk for possession.The Spaniard had to be carried off on a stretcher before being taken to hospital. Pearson suggested the 25-year-old could be out for a very lengthy period of time.Deulofeu’s injury aside this was a perfect night for Watford on the back of their best display of what has been a difficult season. Equally, however, there is no denying they were helped towards a first win in seven games by the manner of their opponents’ showing. Liverpool were incredibly poor, playing with a complete lack of cohesion and purpose in attack, while defensively they were, quite frankly, shocking.No one more so in defence than Dejan Lovren who, having been surprisingly selected over Joël Matip in place of the injured Joe Gomez, did little to dispute the idea that he is an accident waiting to happen with the manner in which he let Adam Mesina’s throw-in bounce over his head in the buildup to Watford’s opening goal on 54 minutes.The Croat allowed himself to be put off by Deeney’s presence and it severely cost Liverpool as Doucouré collected possession and put in Sarr who sent the ball past Alisson.Watford’s third goal also came from a Liverpool defensive error as Sarr pounced on Trent Alexander-Arnold’s weak back pass and, under pressure from Alisson, played a pass to Deeney which he placed into a gaping net. For Alexander-Arnold it was a harrowing moment and also a case of going from the sublime to the ridiculous given the excellent display he had delivered in Monday’s win over West Ham.That goal was also the moment the hosts knew they had wrapped up the three points having gone 2-0 up on the hour after Sarr had collected Deeney’s cute pass and, having sped through on goal, coolly lifted the ball over the out‑rushing Alisson.It was a wonderful moment during a wonderful display by the Senegal international whose only regret was that he failed to secure a hat-trick after dragging a relatively easy chance wide of the far post before he was substituted.Liverpool’s threat was all but nonexistent. Adam Lallana hit the post with a long-range strike soon after coming on and, overall, they produced only one shot on target – Andy Robertson’s second-half strike that Ben Foster saved with ease.That, ultimately, was that for the visitors. And while they will no doubt recover and go on to win that first championship in 30 years – they require 12 points from their remaining 10 games to do so – there was no record-breaking 19th consecutive top-flight victory to celebrate here, nor the chance of going the entire campaign unbeaten, something that will no doubt be savoured in the red half of north London in particular.Arsenal’s class of 2004 will not be superseded by Liverpool’s class of 2020 following a night of genuine shock and awe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d0df865fd2985827dbf848be96eb884660ce409/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d44a0f524e7514f29b2966b704dc98c","title":"harry dunn lawyers urge papers disclosure","story":"Family of teenager who died after collision with car driven by Anne Sacoolas hope documents will bolster case for extraditionLawyers acting for a teenager who died after a collision with a car allegedly driven by an American woman want the High Court to publish a secret document protecting her from prosecution.Harry Dunn, 19, died last summer after his motorbike collided with a car near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US agent who worked at the base, has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving and has apologised to Dunn’s family, but is refusing to return to Britain.US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has rejected the UK’s request for her extradition, claiming that at the time of the collision she had immunity from criminal prosecution, even though her husband did not.The Foreign Office has confirmed the existence of a secret agreement between the UK and the US, signed in 1995, granting US staff working at the base diplomatic immunity, though they are still subject to criminal prosecution under UK law.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab has told parliament that in his view an anomaly in the agreement meant that, while the US staff had waived their rights to be protected against criminal prosecution in the UK, this did not extend to their families. He has pledged to redraft the agreement after learning about the loophole.But lawyers acting for the Dunn family said there were grave doubts over whether the anomaly existed or, if it did, afforded the legal protection Raab has claimed. They want the document setting out the secret agreement – which has been disclosed in the High Court, where the lawyers are challenging the immunity claim – made public.“The Dunn family, backed by senior diplomats and international lawyers, say there is no such thing in international law as an ‘independent immunity’ for partners – their immunity is derived only from the diplomatic agent, and when the agent has none, nor does his wife or family,” said Mark Stephens, the family’s solicitor. “The USRaab argument means that if a diplomat kills his wife, he can, under the 1995 agreement, be prosecuted for murder. If she kills him, however, she will be immune from prosecution.”The Dunns’ legal team suggested the anomaly “could leave over 1,000 partners and friends of all the US agents in Britain entitled to commit criminal offences without trial or punishment”. It has been reported that there have been three cases of American vehicles being driven on the wrong side of the roads outside Croughton since Dunn’s death.The agreement was apparently signed off as the US looked to bolster its spying operations at the Northamptonshire base.“It would have been astonishingly negligent for Foreign Office lawyers to draft documents that created an anomaly which was not in the public interest, and negligent for the Foreign Office not to reveal this so that parliament could debate whether hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Americans should be free from punishment for any crime they might commit,” Stephens said. “Mr Raab not only insists that this is what was done by the previous government but opposes the Dunn family in their wish to have a court clarify the law. He has hired a number of expensive lawyers to argue in favour of the anomaly and has refused to help the Dunn family with their legal costs.”Stephens said it was vital for a court to decide whether Sacoolas genuinely enjoyed immunity from prosecution at the time of her crime. “If she was not, that would pull the rug from Pompeo’s refusal to extradite her,” he said.It is unclear how Sacoolas and her family were able to leave the UK in the days after the crash, but the US government insists it notified the Foreign Office that they were leaving.There have been claims that she herself was a spy. The Foreign Office has said only that: “Anne Sacoolas was notified to us as a spouse with no official role.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f43870d9f63d9ae90d5fe52e816e286391d6215/0_129_3865_2318/master/3865.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc1abc94d7e3d20e4e864f8de2418356","title":"tell us do you have an inner voice","story":"We’d like to find out how you express thoughts in your head?

And how would they stop the colleague with the winning ticket running off? Eva Wiseman contemplates hitting the jackpotA big week. A big big week for Eva Wiseman, as for the first time, she bought a lottery ticket. It wasn’t that I was feeling lucky, no, luck has no place in this lumpen body I’m forced to heave around from seat to seat, the baby playing my innards like a harp. And it wasn’t that I was financially sinking into new depths of desperation, nor am I dying with nothing to lose. I bought a lottery ticket because everyone else did. It started in a typically muted way, the person who sits opposite me at work noting that this week’s jackpot was £34m. Not a showy £100m just a modest, accessible, dignified sum – the kind of money that, split across the desk say, could change all of our lives just the right amount. Everybody in earshot put in £2.50, and the job was done.Except, it had only just begun. In quiet moments between genius and deadlines, a colleague would ask a question. What happens when we win, and all of us get £3m except the person who’s off sick? Do we need to agree on an appropriate sum each, a handful of £1,000s say, to donate to her? Opinion was split. A familiar ugliness emerged. Should the person who held the tickets perhaps share her phone’s location with another colleague, just in case she felt compelled to fly to Mexico when the numbers come in? I proposed a buddy system, the details of which I’m happy to share via email, but be prepared – they are elaborate and cynical. Who would play each of us in the feel-good movie, out next summer? Is it cleaner, perhaps, to dump our current partners now, to avoid messiness on Monday?Normally, I wouldn’t even have registered a lottery, but once the conversation had begun, with all its delicious meanderings through estate agent websites and charitable ventures with our names loudly inserted in the title, I would not be left out. Imagine if I was the lone rational voice, whispering monotone statistics about the impossibilities of winning while my longtime colleagues loudly dreamed? I can be a knob, sure, but I always try not to be a dick. Also, I would like lots of money.No, I would like exactly the right amount of money. I would like the opportunity to do a Michael Carroll, the problematic legend of our time, the man who burned through his £9.7m lottery win with “Roman-style orgies”, bail bonds for his mates, Big Macs that he purchased as missiles to throw at strangers from a Mercedes van painted with the phrase “King of Chavs”, and lots of cocaine. My version would be gentler, of course. “Friends-style orgies”, perhaps, nail bars for my mates, etc. Instead of a Mercedes van, a party bus, the kind that can transform into a boat, and lots of cocaine. No, I jest! I jest. A small amount of cocaine.It became immediately clear, as we discussed our intentions, that money meant different things to each of my colleagues. For some the inevitable win offered a weary respite from worrying about rent, or the cracks in the roof, for others an opportunity to buy something extremely shiny that would display their new successful lives. For me, it is a combination of guilt and padding, guilt because it feels vaguely sickening to fantasise about millions three minutes after reading that rough sleepers are sheltering in bins, “with surging homelessness in the UK blamed for a rising number of deaths by crushing”, and padding, because awareness of how close each of us could be to losing everything means I treat money with a grand, respectful reverence, knowing each new £1 offers another fraction of security.It also became clear that the reasons we were each playing the lottery were different, too. Some colleagues led with superstition – that twinkling drunkenness that offers new answers to old sums. Some enjoyed the rough maths involving calculations of probability that their gentle brains were not evolved enough to process. The optimistic ones were my favourites – the ones that heard we had a one in a million chance as, “We have a chance!” Some weighed up the investment of £2.50, and decided to forego their morning’s coffees in favour of joining in.As evening fell on Friday, the questions had become more meditative, darker. Would our friends feel patronised by our generous gifts? Would our win be a curse, neither enough to change the world, nor too little for it not to change our lives? If we all gave up our jobs, what would life be like with nothing to strive for? Leaving the office in the rain, we nodded to each other with great seriousness, aware now of the golden chains in which we were bound. I made an effort to look carefully at my surroundings, in order to ground myself later – the valiant hand sanitisers, the intricate map made by spilled coffee on the carpet, last week’s newspapers, not even good enough for chips.That night I refreshed my screen alone as the lottery was drawn, my sombre excitement having required silence and a hat. Sixteen tickets we bought, not a single one came in. For the best, I think. For the best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a970d8efc2aaa513855a9800fcc311dcbf51c71/0_984_2577_1546/master/2577.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b76026565f358ad0b0d238410634f43b","title":"funmi fetto winged eyeliner eyeshadow goop cleanser retinol","story":"Exaggerate your eyes only for a bold look, plus gel retinols to smooth and even skin, and a Goop product without the hypeThe exaggerated winged eye – as per Halpern SS20 – makes such a statement that to add anything else is just attention seeking.

I feel very bad in fact. It is a strange cold. Not like usual. I know the kinds of cold I normally have, how my body reacts.“This is different. I am just as bad as I was. I often get better after three days. But with this there is no improvement. I haven’t got one bit better.”She said she had had a severely sore throat for more than five days, after first experiencing a runny nose and a cough.“Now I have this continual cold sweat, I have a temperature, though not all the time,” she said, telling of shivering every night for the past couple of days and feeling nauseous.“I have difficulty breathing and pain in my muscles, and fatigue. I do not pant, but I am finding it hard to breathe. And I am just very, very tired. I have a real tiredness, and a heavy head. I am too tired to do anything.“For a long time this has not felt like a normal cold. These symptoms have lasted almost a week. I know I need to get medicine to get better. This does not go magically.”Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 41, is serving a five-year sentence for espionage, a charge she has consistently denied. She called her family on Saturday to update them on her health, the wider conditions in the prison ward and the reluctance of the prison to test her for the virus.Her husband Richard Ratcliffe had earlier raised concerns at Evin prison’s “refusal to test her” for the virus, which has spread rapidly in Iran.The Foreign Office (FCO) has called on the Iranian government to “immediately allow” health officials into the prison .The FCO said: “We are urgently seeking information from the Iranian authorities on reports that coronavirus is spreading in Evin prison, including to British-Iranian dual nationals.“We call on the Iranian government to immediately allow health professionals into Evin prison to assess the situation of British-Iranian dual nationals there.” So far 43 people in Iran have died from coronavirus – the most in any country besides China. Schools and universities have been closed and concerts and sports events cancelled.Iran confirmed 205 new cases of the coronavirus over the past day, bringing the total number of confirmed infections to 593, The family of another imprisoned British-Iranian national, Anoosheh Ashoori, 65, warned this week of plans to transfer him to the prison’s ward 4, where at least three people are suspected to have the virus.The Iranian judiciary spokesman, Gholam Hossein Ismaili, has responded to growing political pressure over the risk of contagion in prisons by putting prison staff on high alert for signs of the disease.He said he was activating a range of preventive measures including cutting the number of people being sent to jail and allowing some inmates out on temporary early release.Several high-ranking officials, including a vice-minister, deputy health minister and five lawmakers, have tested positive for the coronavirus. The rapid spread of the outbreak prompted the government to call on people to stay at home on Saturday.Iran is preparing for the possibility of testing tens of thousands of people for the coronavirus as the number of confirmed cases in the country rose again, according to an official quoted by the Associated Press.Tehran has dismissed a BBC Persian report that cited unnamed sources in the country’s health system who claimed at least 210 people in Iran had died in the outbreak – about five times as many as officially acknowledged.Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained in April 2016 while trying to depart Iran with her daughter. She was also accused spreading propaganda against the Islamic Republic, charges she denies.

He also demanded that the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, launch an immediate investigation into the reasons for Rutnam’s departure, adding: “Over recent weeks, there has been growing evidence of a serious breakdown of government. The prime minister’s handling of the flooding and coronavirus has been woeful, advisers in No 10 are out of control, and attacks on the civil service are growing.”Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA – the trade union for senior civil servants, which will back Rutnam’s legal case – said Rutnam had been offered the chance to “resign and go quietly with financial compensation” but had instead chosen to speak out against “attacks on civil servants”. It is expected that Rutnam will demand a public hearing at which he can outline his case against Patel.Penman added: “The Home Office now needs to find new leadership at a time when it needs stability. Those who engage in anonymous briefings need to bear the responsibility for this destructive behaviour.”Doubts over the home secretary’s ability to survive come less than three weeks after Sajid Javid’s resignation as chancellor, when he refused to bow to demands from Boris Johnson and the PM’s most senior aide, Dominic Cummings, to sack all his advisers.It also emerged recently that a former adviser to Javid, Sonia Khan, is pursuing a case for unfair dismissal and sex discrimination after she was sacked by Cummings and marched out of Downing Street by an armed police officer last September.Patel has already resigned once from the cabinet, when in 2017 she had to quit as international development secretary, having failed to be candid about unofficial meetings with Israeli ministers, business executives and a senior lobbyist.Lord Kerslake, who was head of the civil service from the end of 2011 until September 2014, said he knew Rutnam well and had been involved in appointing him to his first post as permanent secretary at the Department for Transport in 2012.“For him to do this means he must have been driven to the limit and beyond,” Kerslake said. “To resign is serious enough, but then to take legal action is quite extraordinary. I think it will send bad signals through the civil service. It speaks of some very toxic relationships at the heart of government.”Kerslake said he would expect Patel to resign if Rutnam won his case for constructive dismissal.Lord Turnbull, a former cabinet secretary, said such personnel disputes were normally settled quietly behind the scenes. “When there is an issue, a way would normally be found to secure a judicious job swap or some other route would be found to resolve the difficulty,” he said. “For this to have got to this stage is extraordinary and potentially extremely damaging for the civil service.”When asked if Johnson retained full confidence in his home secretary, a Downing Street official said: “The prime minister has complete confidence in all of his cabinet.”Labour MP Stephen Doughty, a member of the home affairs select committee, said Patel’s position was now in doubt “following this chaos”. He added: “This utterly extraordinary statement by a senior civil servant is clear evidence of just how dangerously dysfunctional relationships are becoming at the heart of this government – driven by a toxic culture at the very top.”The tensions between Patel and her permanent secretary surfaced last weekend. Reports suggested she had clashed with senior officials, belittled colleagues and was distrusted by intelligence chiefs. One report suggested Patel had tried to move Rutnam from her department after the rows.Labour’s Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, said the row reflected “extremely badly on the government”.She said: “To end up with one of the most senior public servants in the country taking court action against one of the great offices of state shows a shocking level of breakdown in the normal functioning of government.“For the home secretary and prime minister to have allowed things to reach this point is appalling, especially at a time when the Home Office faces crucial challenges with rising violent crime, forthcoming counter-terror legislation, new immigration laws, and sensitive negotiations on post-Brexit security cooperation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a62b56da0fe8a676faef4220d76d8dfe7ce282d/0_233_5370_3222/master/5370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce069c505e10061ca57ce169819cc164","title":"uk turning security into eu trade talks bargaining chip","story":"Boris Johnson has been accused of playing politics with the safety of Europeans after rejecting an EU proposal for future defence and foreign policy coordination.At No 10’s insistence, the issue has been left out of negotiations starting in Brussels on Monday on the post-Brexit relationship.EU sources accused the UK of trying to create leverage in the talks by rejecting Brussels’s suggestion in its negotiating mandate of an “ambitious, close and lasting cooperation on external action to protect citizens from external threats”.“On paper London’s vision of global Britain looks increasingly isolationist,” an EU diplomat added.The EU concern is that Johnson is attempting to put a “sword of Damocles” over the head of member states, particularly in the east of Europe where there are continued concerns about Russian aggression.Yan St-Pierre, a counter-terrorism expert, said the UK was “playing politics with Europe’s security”. With the US, it was “light years ahead” of the EU in electronic security capability – the online monitoring of terrorist activity, electronic surveillance, drone and satellite technology, he said.St-Pierre, head of the Berlin firm Modern Security Consulting, which advises EU governments, said: “The UK knows, especially when it comes to its electronic security capability, that it has a major bargaining chip.”The UK’s approach was effectively holding Europe hostage over its needs to protect itself. “The Germans, the French, a lot of other European countries, don’t have the capabilities that the UK has. It’s a very real bargaining chip compounded by the fact that US foreign policy is unreliable in the era of Trump,” said St-Pierre. “The EU countries are extremely dependent both on the UK and the US for electronic security and the sharing of electronic information.”The security of Europe, added St-Pierre, operated on a two-tier basis. The first was a formal, structured arrangement bound by official agreements and the second, a more informal arrangement built on human relationships and trusted sources.A government spokesman rejected the claims: “We expect foreign policy cooperation to be substantial but we don’t think we need a clunky institutional framework to deliver it. “We are already working closely with the EU on a wide range of issues including Iran, Libya and Russia absent such a framework, and see no reason why this cannot continue. We are open to discussing technical agreements where genuinely needed, such as a security of information agreement so we can share classified information, and are of course interested to hear the EU’s views.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2566709f9c4a924fa0b205927bec620eebe1e496/0_200_7042_4225/master/7042.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c7aa3ed7ef09120aec41d39c37649f5","title":"treasury adviser farming and fisheries are not important","story":"Tim Leunig, who advises Rishi Sunak, has suggested ministers could look to be like SingaporeOne of the most senior government advisers has said the UK does not need its farming or fishing industries, according to reports.In comments seen by the Mail on Sunday, Dr Tim Leunig is understood to have said the food sector was “not critically important” to the country’s economy – and that agriculture and fisheries “certainly isn’t”.The economic adviser to the chancellor, in his leaked emails, is reported to have said that ministers could follow the example of Singapore, which is “rich without having its own agricultural sector”.Leunig’s opinions are likely to propel industry fears that ministers could discard safeguards for farmers and fishermen in the forthcoming post-Brexit trade talks with the US and the European Union.The government has, however, distanced itself from the comments made by the Treasury adviser. A spokesman said: “We have made clear the comments are not in line with government policy.”Sources told the PA news agency that the remarks were made in personal emails and that Dr Leunig was not speaking in his Treasury role.But rural and coastal communities voted out in large numbers during the 2016 referendum after the Vote Leave campaign argued that farmers and fishermen would would be better off once free of EU rules.Food standards have proved to be a crux issue as negotiators prepare for trade talks with their US counterparts in the coming weeks.Last week, the environment secretary, George Eustice, came in for criticism after he refused to rule out chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef being imported from the US as part of a trade agreement with Washington.Allowing such treated and often cheaper foods into the UK could undermine British farmers who operate to higher standards.Fishermen also fear promises made to them on increased catch quotas and controlling who fishes in British waters could be traded in exchange for market access during the talks with the EU, which are due to begin next week.Brussels has made clear it wants little to change in terms of access for European boats and quota allocation once the transition period is over in December.Leunig’s comments would not be the first time a government figure has managed to upset UK industry.Boris Johnson is said to have made controversial comments on the topic of Brexit, having reportedly said “fuck business” when questioned about the sector’s concerns over a no-deal exit from the EU in 2018.Treasury adviser and academic Dr Leunig is said to be close to Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s chief adviser in Downing Street.Cummings has called for “weirdos and misfits” to join the civil service in an effort to break the mould of current Whitehall thinking.Whitehall saw a huge rupture at the head of the Home Office on Saturday when Sir Philip Rutnam, the department’s most senior civil servant, quit and launched a tirade against the home secretary.Sir Philip accused Priti Patel of orchestrating a “vicious” campaign against him, of lying about her involvement in it and of creating a climate of fear in her department.He told the BBC he planned to sue for constructive dismissal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/003128bc972dfe8ca695b4e65bd1602f55cf665e/0_70_5725_3435/master/5725.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81b52cdb9de8c2bb78adf43aee58cf93","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youIf you’ve been affected by the coronavirus, we’d like to hear from you.A British man who was quarantined on Diamond Princess cruise ship has died, Japanese media reports.

The lead had changed hands throughout, especially in a second half that featured turn after turn. Exeter faced one passage of play, well after time and down to 13 men, but the final deed – a penalty try at the umpteenth chaotic scrum – settled the game in the home team’s favour five minutes after the clock had turned red.“It was one of our more important wins,” said Harlequins director of rugby Paul Gustard. “I was really impressed with the character of the team to keep going for the win when they could have settled for the draw.”Repeatedly, Quins opted to scrum penalties, several after normal time with a three-point deficit and the posts beckoning. It was an all-out assault, which came off with that climactic penalty try. The bonus-point win takes Quins into the top six, from ninth, but Exeter remain clear at the top. Curiously, it was at the scrum they were found out, even as they ran in three fine tries with an aplomb more associated with Harlequins.It looked as if they would do no more than pick up where they left off the weekend before, when they had put 50 past fellow play-off contenders Northampton. With pretty much their first stretch of possession, Phil Dollman dummied and broke inside Marcus Smith for a fine inidual try in the third minute.The home side rode that indignity and started to flex their muscles. To begin with, the Quins scrum could do no wrong. Having won an early penalty, they won another within range, which Smith landed. Joe Simmonds replied almost immediately with a penalty before Harlequins levelled, again the points stemming from another scrum. They were scrumming penalties as early as the 20th minute, but at the site of the latest scrum penalty Danny Care, in his 200th Premiership appearance, tapped and fed the formidable Paul Lasike.There is not much arguing with the American on the charge and his path to the line was unbroken. Very direct, very Exeter.A penalty apiece, albeit with Exeter’s scrum starting to win favour for no obvious reason, maintained parity at the break. Neither Exeter’s ascendancy at the scrum nor the parity was to last long. Quins repeated the scrum-Care-Lasike routine to set up Tevita Cavubati from close range.Cue the Simmonds brothers. Sam cut inside Lasike like the centre he might have been in another life for a dazzling break, which was improved when brother Joe ghosted past four more tacklers to the line to draw Exeter level. Three minutes later, and Sam broke again, Elvis Taione charged deep into Quins territory, before Joe ghosted through again, past three this time, for Exeter’s third.Quins levelled on the hour. Another scrum (instead of a simple shot at goal), and Alex Dombrandt fed Care who sent Smith on an arc round the Exeter midfield. Nick Auterac was shown the first of three late yellow cards, when he deliberately knocked-on after Joe Simmonds had split Quins’ defence once more. The latter landed the penalty that put Exeter ahead with quarter of an hour to go.The drama was only just beginning. Ollie Devoto’s high tackle on Smith meant he was next to go to the bin, with six minutes to go. Quins continued to take scrums for each penalty. With a minute to go, the referee apologised for awarding one too quickly when Care cross-kicked to an unmarked Gabriel Ibitoye with what should have been the advantage. From then on, any benefit of the doubt would go to the home side.Alec Hepburn’s yellow card at the umpteenth scrum penalty reduced Exeter to 13 briefly, but there would be time for Devoto to return before the game was finally settled. The scrum splintered into chaos, and the referee marched to the sticks. An unsatisfactory way to win, perhaps, but appropriately dramatic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f7e633dc4d46754b0aa008cb05042ce39852f1f/0_170_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63e88a0fd17b93bcb527a985f91a9c2b","title":"wales time adapt new coach alun wyn jones","story":"The defending champions never lost three successive Six Nations matches under Warren Gatland but, with Twickenham next, it could happen in Wayne Pivac’s first campaignThe Six Nations launch is an occasion when hope tends to outscrummage expectation but Alun Wyn Jones was one at this year’s event who did not allow himself to be transported by fancy. The 12-year reign of Warren Gatland, when a success-starved nation was transported back to the 1970s, had ended 10 weeks before and his successor, Wayne Pivac, was coming to terms with replacing a legend.“There has been a lot of change and, to a point, we have to cut ties with the past,” said the Wales captain back then. “If you continue to look over your shoulder, you will slow yourself down. If you are going to evolve, you have to adapt. It is going to be a bumpy road and we cannot shy away from that.”Three rounds in, Wales have been bumped off as champions despite a five-try victory over Italy in the opening round. This was followed by a mistake-soaked display in Dublin as Storm Ciara started to blow in, although they showed the characteristics honed by Gatland of hanging on in a game when they were a distant second, and then a first home defeat by France in 10 years, after which Pivac resisted the very great temptation to blame three instances of the officials failing to apply the rules as a factor in the result.“The performances have been pleasing in patches but there is no consolation in a certain amount,” says Jones now. “It is only pleasing when you win. We made a decent start but our errors against Ireland compounded themselves and we created opportunities against France but did not take enough of them. Test rugby is about winning and we have not done that.”Wales never lost three successive championship matches under Gatland, who marked his first campaign in charge in 2008 with a grand slam, but that fate is on the cards on Saturday when they travel to Twickenham, the ground where they have enjoyed the least success in the Six Nations, their two victories coming in that slam season and in 2012.“I have played there a few times and we know what is coming,” says Jones. “It is always a big week. England are building after a disappointing start and they are putting the pieces together to be the complete team they showed they were in the World Cup. They are pretty rudimentary, in the way they impose themselves rather than the way they play.“It is uncharted territory for us after two defeats but I do not think you can compare this season with the 12 Warren had. The level is here and now and I do not think it is about looking at the two coaches. Warren established himself over a long period of time and everyone became used to what he was about and what he did. It is unfair to compare an experienced writer with one who is new to the job,” he says, turning it back on his questioners.Pivac, who spent five years with the Scarlets, was appointed with a brief to evolve Wales’s attacking game. There has been a distinct change in emphasis with kicking more strategic than a means of setting up the defence and inviting a catcher to break it down and players such as Nick Tompkins have been used to attack shoulders rather than take contact, but understanding takes time, with pressure in the Six Nations unrelenting and the new coach started at a time when a number of his first-choice backs and a couple of forwards were unavailable.“We can be reactionary and throw the baby out with the bathwater or we can step back and reflect that there is change,” says Jones. “I said from the outset that the fact we were changing was no excuse, but we are adapting. People asked for that in the past and it is about getting more out of our performances and turning them into results rather than stepping back and pointing fingers. That way you can come out on the other side.”Pivac and his management team are contracted until the next World Cup but they all have break clauses in 2021, one reason why Shaun Edwards declined to extend his 12 years with the Welsh Rugby Union and instead move to France where his deal runs to the end of 2023. The WRU could not afford to lumber itself financially but it accepted there would be a period of transition.While Gatland won the Six Nations at the first attempt, his next three years in the tournament were unexceptional, with eight victories and seven defeats. It changed in 2011 when he blooded a number of young players and made Sam Warburton captain. Wales made the World Cup semi-finals that year and won the championship in 2012 and 2013.Time, Jones argues, is what Pivac needs. “We are trying to play with our heads up and develop the style Wayne wants, which is anything but robotic,” he says. “Change is the most difficult thing whatever line of work you are in. We have to stay strong and not be shackled by fear.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39c510d50227249488bfe3b804fd0c732d43c17d/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d9697bf85fcdc8d9a01396b869a633b","title":"the breadwinners of barishal how women in bangladesh are starting their own businesses","story":"Women in this flood-hit area are supporting their families through small businesses backed by the British Red Cross. From tailoring to tea making, the success of these enterprises is inspiring other young women to follow suitby  Thaslima Begum in BarishalIn the sprawling urban slums of Barishal, where monsoons and flooding are inescapable, life for women is hard. They are more likely to miss out on getting an education, and without the proper knowledge and skill set, many struggle to make a living. As they are more likely to live in poverty, they are more affected by disasters. But despite these challenges, with the help of livelihood grants from the Red Cross, many women in Barishal are finding innovative ways to eke out a living.Rina, 37, from Palashpur, wakes up early every day to start preparing for work. From a side road of a small slum with heavy foot traffic, she has been running a successful tea stall for the last two years. Brightly coloured crisp packets hang like a banner across her shopfront, where Rina sells roughly 160 cups of tea a day at 5 taka (under 5p) a cup.She uses the money to pay for her children’s education and managed to save enough to buy a small TV, which kept her busy during the World Cup. “Everyone here loves football, so I thought it would be a good investment,” she says proudly. “Not everyone in the slums owns a TV, so when they stop to watch, they also buy tea.”Married at 12, Rina now has five children and is the sole breadwinner of her family. Her husband suffered a stroke seven years ago and is no longer able to work. “I had no money to feed my children. I’d already taken out loans and was worried about our financial situation.” But in 2018, she received a small grant, which enabled her to kickstart her own business.Rina’s customers are mostly men labourers who come to drink chai during their breaks and catch up with their friends. Though they don’t speak to Rina much, she has learned a lot from listening in on their conversations. “They discuss everything – sports, politics, economics and the weather – information I never had access to while sitting at home.”Knowledge about the weather is particularly important for Rina as flooding hampers her business. “When the water comes in, people aren’t interested in sitting around drinking tea.”As she buys her tea wholesale, grown in north-eastern districts such as Sylhet, it’s important for Rina to know of incoming natural disasters that might affect her supply, so that she can plan ahead.Mahmuda, 36, has just had a baby and is making plans on how to balance her tailoring business with motherhood. After receiving a small business loan, Mahmuda was able to establish her tailoring business, which has been going from strength to strength. Dressed in a traditional shalwar kameez she made herself, Mahmuda gently rocks baby Diya back and forth.After going into labour early and losing a lot of blood, the doctors thought both mother and baby wouldn’t make it. Mahmuda was able to use the money she generated from her business to pay for hospital fees and basic necessities for her premature baby.“My business is slowly expanding, and I am able to feed my children,” she says. Mahmuda buys materials and sews clothes for the women in her community. She recently bought a wardrobe to safely store her clothing and protect it from flooding and the smell of the draining system outside her home.Mahmuda lives with her baby and two young sons, sick husband and elderly mother – all of whom she supports financially. Her father left when she was small, so Mahmuda’s mother raised her on her own. She is happy to now be able to take care of her in return. “I am also able to maintain my sons’ educational expenses, which I couldn’t do before – it was a real struggle to pay their tuition fees every month.”Every morning, before the sun rises, Mukhal, 28, sets off on a small dinghy to the local fish market. Dressed in a black burka and face veil so as not to draw attention, Mukhal is one of the few women who can be found in a market mostly dominated by men. Over time she has been able to develop her negotiation skills, so she gets a better price for the catch. She then fills her basket and carries it back to her village, where she sells the fish to her neighbours.Mukhal has led a difficult life. Forced into marriage at the age of 12 when her father died, she became pregnant at 15, and was beaten then abandoned by her husband who took another wife. Her home is on the banks of the river and prone to flooding. “Everything I do is for my son. My only hope is to be the best mother that I can be. I don’t want my son to live this kind of life – I want him to be educated and to have a good job. He wants to be an engineer! I work hard to pay for his education, so he doesn’t have to struggle like me.”Also driven by a strong desire to help her family, Chompa, 15, currently works in an electronics factory. Her father was a rickshaw puller, but because of his old age and the flooding from heavy rain, such arduous work has become difficult. So Chompa is now the main breadwinner in her family, spending all day at a factory where she uses her small hands to put together electronic goods destined for faraway places worlds she catches brief glimpses of through the TV screens that she helps assemble.Chompa earns approximately 4,000 taka (£36.30) a month, which she puts towards rent, food and her parents’ medicines. But a few months ago, while building a fan, it suddenly switched on and the blades sliced off three of her fingers. “There was blood everywhere,” she says. “After a few seconds, I passed out.” Though the factory covered her hospital bill, and at this time she is still receiving her monthly salary, a future without able hands feels uncertain – she says she is likely to be downgraded or dismissed from her role.“What can I expect from this life?” she asks. “I have many dreams, but there are no opportunities.” She wishes she could attend school, but like many young girls from Barishal, this isn’t always an option. One day, when she is old enough, Chompa wants to own a business. She has seen the examples of other women in her community achieving success providing her with glimmers of hope that another reality is not only possible, it is within reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffc97ec81e899ccbd809c169bd9fec88fc1d89e0/0_169_5073_3044/master/5073.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c4e25aa19d87de4dbf457cbd7d1f169","title":"south carolina primary voters joe biden bernie sanders","story":"Joe Biden delivered a landslide victory in the South Carolina primary vote on Saturday, breathing new life into his presidential campaign and establishing himself as the main moderate competitor to Bernie Sanders in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.“We are very much alive,” a visibly elated Biden said at a victory rally in Columbia, the state capital. “For all of you who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind this is your campaign.”“Just days ago, the press and the pundits had declared this candidacy dead,” he added.The victory, brought by a surge in support among African American voters, comes at a turning point in the campaign. There are just two days before Super Tuesday, when 14 states and two other constituencies will go to the polls to award a third of the total number of presidential delegates, which eventually determine that Democratic nominee.Biden will be hoping to ride the momentum out of South Carolina to a strong showing next week, where he faces an aggressive Sanders campaign that continues to surge in the critical states of California, Texas and Virginia, and when billionaire and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg will be on the ballot for the first time.The win marks the first time that Biden – who ran unsuccessful campaigns for president in 2008 and 1988 – has ever claimed victory in a presidential primary.Biden, Barack Obama’s former vice-president, used his victory speech to present himself as the Democrats’ most viable chance of defeating Donald Trump in November’s general election.“We have the option of winning big or losing big, that’s the choice” he said. “We need real changes, right now. Something I’ve done my whole career, and I’ll do as president.”In a thinly veiled criticism of Sanders, an independent senator who is running for president as a Democratic candidate, he urged voters to elect “a lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat”.“Tonight, we did not win in South Carolina. That will not be the only defeat. A lot of states in this country. Nobody wins them all,” Sanders told a crowd in Virginia, as he pivoted quickly to ballots next week. “Now we enter Super Tuesday.”Despite poor showings in both recent debates, Bloomberg’s campaign has indicated they will continue their campaign into Super Tuesday. On Saturday, Bloomberg announced he had bought an unprecedented three minute advertising slot to be broadcast on Sunday on a number of major TV networks. He has spent $500m of his personal fortune on the race.As news of Biden’s victory broke almost as soon as polls closed, Trump mocked Bloomberg on Twitter and called for him to leave the race.He said the outcome “should be the end of Mini Mike Bloomberg’s Joke of a campaign. After the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates, Mini Mike now has Biden split up his very few voters, taking many away!”The South Carolina primary did mark the end of the line for the contest’s other billionaire candidate, the former hedge fund manager and climate change activist Tom Steyer. After finishing third in a state where he had invested tens of millions of dollars, Steyer told supporters at a rally in Columbia: “We were disappointed with where we came out.”He added: “Honestly, I can’t see a path where I can win the presidency.”Steyer failed to win a single delegate in any of the early voting states.Clyburn, who had withheld his affirmation following Biden’s poor start to the primary season, introduced the former Delaware senator on Saturday evening. “This campaign, this year, is about the goodness of America. And we have, as our candidate, a real good man,” Clyburn said, as he played to the major messaging of Biden’s run, which has been to present himself in marked contrast to the shambolic and isive leadership of Donald Trump.But earlier in the day Clyburn had been frank about Biden’s need to reinvigorate his campaign and address the lack of organization that has characterized his ground game in early states and many of the major Super Tuesday locations.“We will have to sit down and get serious about how we retool this campaign,” told CNN. He added: “I’m not going to sit back idly and watch people mishandle this campaign.”Clyburn’s remarks are reflective of the uphill battle Biden still faces to surpass Sanders’ campaign in a race that is about scoring enough delegates, 1,991, to win the nomination.Biden’s win on Saturday takes his tally up to 41, just 12 behind Sanders, according to CNN. Pete Buttigieg is currently third with 26 delegates with Elizabeth Warren on eight and Amy Klobuchar on seven lagging behind.1,344 delegates will up for grabs on Tuesday, meaning a decisive victory for Sanders could make his lead an even higher mountain to climb."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/511a3cf847b9d8f2e11a19e6c5fc4cdeb7d67218/104_755_6208_3725/master/6208.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=009c7a667e698a9bc2248f4532f47793","title":"italy and france ban public gatherings as coronavirus cases spread","story":"The US recorded its first death from coronavirus yesterday, when a man in his 50s died in a care home. A further 21 residents were confirmed to be suffering from the virus, with four of them said to be very ill.The outbreak at the home in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland led to the vice president, Mike Pence, announcing a ban on travel to Iran and stronger warnings on travel to Italy and South Korea.The US president, Donald Trump, said that there were likely to be more cases and he would consider additional restrictions, including closing the US border with Mexico in response to the virus’s spread.The victim was said to be of a high medical risk and there was no evidence he had travelled abroad or had links to anyone who had. Washington state health officials said other residents and some staff were also showing “some sort of symptoms” but had not yet been diagnosed.About 60 cases have been confirmed in the US. Trump said healthy Americans should recover if they contract the virus, as he tried to reassure Americans and global markets. “We’ve taken the most aggressive actions to confront the coronavirus,” he said. “Our country is prepared for any circumstance. There is no reason to panic at all.”Elsewhere, Ireland reported its first case of the virus, as did Ecuador and Luxembourg. Mexico reported two more cases, bringing the country’s total to four, and Brazil announced its second.France and Italy imposed strict bans on public gatherings as numbers of coronavirus cases rose dramatically in both countries.One of the first casualties of the ban was Sunday’s Paris half-marathon, which has been cancelled, while a major four-day trade show in Cannes for property investors has been put back from March to June.In Italy, five key football matches were postponed this weekend. The games include the crunch top-of-the-table Serie A clash between Inter Milan and Juventus. The matches had been scheduled to take place behind closed doors after the Italian government banned public gatherings as part of its campaign to try to slow the spread of Covid-19. But now Serie-A officials have decided the matches will be played on 13 May – when fans will be able to attend.Nearly 900 people have tested positive for the virus in Italy, and authorities in northern regions – where Europe’s worst outbreak is centred – on Saturday ordered that schools and universities should stay closed for a second week, dashing any hopes of a swift return to normality.In France, authorities on Saturday reported 16 new cases of the virus. “All public gatherings of more than 5,000 people in a confined space are temporarily banned,” health minister Olivier Véran announced.He also advised people to cut back on la bise – the custom of greeting friends and relatives with kisses. As of Saturday, France had registered 73 virus cases, up from 57 on Friday and of these, 59 people remained in hospital, two had died and 12 had recovered, Véran added.More than 50 countries have now reported cases, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has upgraded the global risk of the outbreak to “very high” – its top level of risk assessment.Globally, there are an estimated 85,000 cases, and there have been 2,900 deaths. The virus has been detected in 58 countries, although the WHO said on Friday that there was still a chance of containing it if its chain of transmission were broken.South Korea has also reported a “critical moment” in its battle against transmission, after 813 new cases were detected in the country in a single day, while the Japanese island of Hokkaido announced a three-week state of emergency, part of a number of measures to slow the outbreak."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a1d34a3b3cf7e14e248b3e711ea1d39a2c57c7f/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d1987f1992e263cd52ba1008e653c7f","title":"its the last nail in the coffin venice empties as coronavirus spreads","story":"Outbreak triggers new crisis as city struggles to recover from November’s severe floodsIn St Mark’s Square last week, tables and chairs outside the famed Caffè Florian remained empty, with the few tourists spoiled for space as they posed for selfies. More white medical masks than carnival masks could be seen. Rows of empty gondolas seemed to rock impatiently.After Venice cancelled most of its annual celebrations amid Italy’s attempts to contain Europe’s worst coronavirus outbreak, most visitors ran for the hills, leaving the lagoon city a virtual ghost town.The Venetian tourism industry is still reeling after severe flooding in November left much of the city under water now it has a very different kind of crisis to face. More than 800 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in Italy, and 29 people have died.“We were waiting for the carnival to get the economy going again after the acqua alta, but now we have a new problem,” said Sabrina, a worker at fashion store Sartoria dei Dogi.“It’s completely dead: no one comes past, the streets are empty, and people are afraid,” said Paola Bertoldo, who sells her own Murano glass jewellery from a shop in the Santa Croce district. “I don’t know how we can manage this time. This is the last nail in the coffin.”The entire economy has been affected, said Simone Venturini, city councillor for economic development. The real damage would be long-term, he said, with few bookings for the usually busy periods of Easter and the Biennale arts festival starting in May. “In a few weeks, we believe the virus will be a distant memory like Sars, but we need to get the message out that it’s business as normal.”Venice, which receives 20-30 million holidaymakers a year, has a love-hate relationship with tourists. Overcrowding causes antagonism between those Venetians who make a living from tourism and those who feel suffocated. Some residents were finding the reduction in tourism liberating, said Jane Da Mosto, founder of the thinktank We Are Here Venice.“Of course it’s terrible that livelihoods are being affected, but now people can breathe,” she said. “It’s like being on a crammed subway and then being able to read your book and stretch.”As far as Da Mosto is concerned, the tourism timeout ought to be an opportunity to rethink and implement viral systemic changes, but it is unlikely to happen in a city where the needs of Venetians are ignored in favour of the tourism industry. “If this is a wake-up call,” she asked, “who is listening?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e4278ce158beb47c02d7c212c243245fd6deb77/0_31_4638_2784/master/4638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f42613411efb4735eb89a6be74a6e1e","title":"muhyiddin yassin named as malaysian prime minister","story":"Mahathir calls for urgent sitting of parliament, saying PM-designate Muhyiddin Yassin lacks majority support Malaysia’s 94-year-old former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad will ask for an urgent sitting of parliament to see if the man who surprisingly toppled him, Muhyiddin Yassin, has majority support.The former interior minister Muhyiddin was named prime minister by the king in a shock twist that returned a scandal-plagued party to power. Mahathir, who remains the interim PM, told a news conference on Sunday that he had support from a majority of lawmakers but the king would no longer see him.“We are going to see a man who does not have majority support become prime minister,” Mahathir said, adding that he felt betrayed by Muhyiddin, whom he accused of plotting for a long time to take the prime ministership.Muhyiddin Yassin was sworn in on Sunday, royal officials said, after a week of turmoil that followed the collapse of a reformist government and Mahathir’s resignation as PM. “The process to appoint the prime minister cannot be delayed because the country needs a government for the wellbeing of the people and the nation,” a palace statement said. The king appoints the prime minister, and rival candidates had this week been seeking to show they commanded majority support from MPs.As well as ending the reign of Mahathir, who was the world’s oldest prime minister, the developments mean there will be little hope of his designated successor, Anwar Ibrahim, taking.Muhyiddin’s coalition is dominated by the multi-ethnic country’s Muslim majority and includes the United Malays National Organisation (Umno), the scandal-plagued party of the disgraced former leader Najib Razak.Umno was the lynchpin of a long-ruling coalition that was toppled from power in elections in 2018 amid allegations that Najib and his cronies had looted the state fund 1MDB.Muhyiddin, a former Mahathir ally, joined forces with Umno in an attempt to win power. His coalition also includes a hardline Muslim party that is pushing for Islamic laws.The crisis began when Mahathir and Anwar’s ruling Pact of Hope alliance, which stormed to victory two years ago against Najib’s government, collapsed a week ago.A group of ruling coalition lawmakers had joined forces with opposition parties in an attempt to form a new government without Anwar and stop him becoming premier.After that effort failed, Mahathir and Anwar launched rival bids to win power, reviving a rivalry that has shaped politics in the country for more than two decades.But as Muhyiddin’s bid quickly gained support and it became clear he could get into power with Umno, Mahathir and Anwar did a volte-face and joined forces again on Saturday.The remaining parties from the Pact of Hope alliance threw their support behind Mahathir to become prime minister, and there had been hopes he could stop Muhyiddin.The Pact of Hope, a band of opposition groups that included a party dominated by the country’s ethnic Chinese minority, Anwar’s People’s Justice party and Mahathir’s Malay-dominated outfit, was uneasy from the start.Mahathir had pledged to eventually hand the prime ministership to Anwar, but many were sceptical he wanted to give power to his old rival, and rival factions were seeking to push Anwar out.Muhyiddin, 72, was a member of Umno for many decades and held a string of senior posts. He was deputy prime minister in Najib’s government, but Najib sacked him after he voiced criticism of the 1MDB scandal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78691b395f4f51b63c328c817d0678a88f39d71f/0_194_5787_3474/master/5787.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c376a09505f6eda6a1eeed4b5a117b8e","title":"weinstein british accusers hid identities to prevent intimidation","story":"British women allegedly raped or sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein took extraordinary steps to prevent the disgraced Hollywood producer from attempting to intimidate them and undermine their cases.Six British women were so concerned that Weinstein would leak their identities to the media before or during his rape trial in New York that they were granted a highly unusual court order granting them international anonymity.Last week Weinstein was found guilty of raping one woman and sexually assaulting another, a watershed victory for abuse victims more than two years after the first claims against the 67-year-old surfaced. He is awaiting sentence and is reportedly discussing an appeal.The London lawyer for British women bringing claims against the producer was worried that until Weinstein was convicted his team might have been tempted to leak the identities of the British women in a move to destabilise them and deter them from pursuing their cases.Unlike in the UK, there is no automatic anonymity for victims of sexual assault in the US. Jill Greenfield, a partner at law firm Fieldfisher, said her move had been made in order to protect victims from undue pressure. “We have made sure that key parties involved cannot disclose details of my clients. You’ve also got to think about the person who’s had the allegations made against them and who might want to put victims’ details in the press.“When you have someone so powerful in any walk of life, they may want to put those details out there”, she said.Greenfield, who lodged the first civil claim at London’s high court against Weinstein for alleged rape and sexual assault days after the allegations against the producer emerged in October 2017, said: “They are entitled to automatic anonymity here but the defendant lives abroad, and the concern is that they are not entitled to automatic anonymity in the US.”However, Weinstein’s guilty verdict is believed to have convinced at least one of his alleged British victims to speak publicly about her experience for the first time.Evidence exists that Weinsten and his team have previously attempted to target his alleged victims. In 2017, it emerged that he had tried to suppress allegations that he had sexually harassed or assaulted numerous women.Weinstein hired private security agencies to collect information on the women as part of a strategy to prevent accusers from going public with sexual assault claims against him.Most of the women Greenfield is representing are understood not to be high-profile like some of those involved in the New York trial, which featured actresses such as Annabella Sciorra. However, Greenfield added that fears of her clients’ identities being exposed escalated when they had liaised with the New York police department, making it difficult for UK victims to feel safe giving background information for the trial.“One of the real problems my clients had was they realised that stepping into a court in New York meant the flashbulbs would be going everything would be reported. Suddenly their lives would be an open book.”As well as the six cases, which list Weinstein companies in the UK and US as defendants, the politan Police is currently investigating 16 allegations against Weinstein of sexual assault. from 11 women.Analysis of Operation Kaguyak, the investigation into allegations involving Weinstein, reveal that the oldest claims date to the 1980s and concern an alleged attack in west London. One woman says she was sexually assualted three separate times, in Westminster in 2010 and 2011, and Camden in 2015. Seven of the alleged attacks took place in the policing area of Westminster, which covers the West End.Weinstein is facing up to 29 years in prison and is due to be sentenced on 11 March. The New York trial heard weeks of harrowing testimony from six women who claimed that Weinstein had attacked them.They included an actress who said that he injected something into his genitals to get an erection and raped her in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.Sciorra, best known for her work in The Sopranos, told the court that she was raped by Weinstein at her home almost 30 years ago. “My testimony was painful but necessary,” she said. Weinstein now faces an additional rape and sexual assault prosecution in Los Angeles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfc9a7419eeabf7e1b0293a66c288c136900f62a/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbb317aec19d603e151db53b22cf5caf","title":"israel limbo third election twelve months netanyahu gantz","story":"Neither Benjamin Netanyahu nor opponent Benny Gantz are likely to break political deadlockIsraelis are due to vote on Monday in the country’s third election in 12 months, with many worried the result will be just as inconclusive as previous rounds, extending a painful political stalemate deep into 2020.After two failed attempts to form a government, the country has been plunged into limbo, run by an interim administration without powers to pass significant legislation or even a budget.Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is – once again – facing off against his former army chief of staff, Benny Gantz. Polls still suggest that neither side will have enough seats in Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, to end the crisis. The country may be dragged into yet another months-long election cycle.While politicians bicker, Israel has remained on autopilot, and the stasis has already affected state-funded projects, not only building roads and classrooms, but also vital charity work.Lior Finkel Perl, who heads an umbrella organisation for non-profit organisations (NGOs), the Israeli Civic Leadership Association, said the lack of a 2020 budget meant that no new government contracts had been handed out, while ongoing projects were also facing severe delays in getting funds, even cancelling some services due to the unpredictability.“Basically, what happened is a lot of services that are very important are either being reduced or are being cut,” she said. “You can see it in different organisations that are dealing with important issues: those that are helping people in need shelters for women who suffer from violence organisations that are doing extra-curricular activities after school.”The biggest issue, she said, was that NGOs could not plan ahead as it was not clear when the political crisis would end. “It’s a lost year.”In one extreme case, 11,000 low-income families across Israel were told at the end of last year that they would stop receiving monthly coupons worth 500 shekels (around £112) for fruit and vegetables and other food, according to Avi Dabush, executive director of Rabbis for Human Rights, an organisation that helps run the project.While Israel’s economy remains strong, there are also growing concerns that ifthere is no concrete result this time, the country could see a dent in growth, and a larger-than-expected budget deficit could swell.Professor Avi Weiss, an economist and president of the Taub Center for Social Policy Studies in Israel, said the simple act of holding election after election also had a downside. Each one costs hundreds of millions of shekels to run, and in Israel, voting days are a national holiday, shutting down production.“There is really no reason it should be a holiday, especially when you are doing it three times a year,” he said. “It would be nice if this would come to an end at some point.”Meanwhile, new construction projects have been put on hold. Jewish religious seminaries, or Yeshivas, are also due to run out of money in several months, which could deeply affect the welfare-dependent religious community.Gideon Rahat, a political science professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, said the repeat elections also presented a more fundamental problem – they were beginning to test the very foundations of the entire Israeli political system. The logic of the parliamentary model, he said, was based on the presumption that politicians would not voluntarily oust themselves after winning a gruelling election. Instead – and as usually happens – enough of them back a candidate, who then becomes prime minister.In the past two elections, however, MPs have willingly pushed for the Knesset to be disbanded because they were convinced or pressed by party leaders that they could do better in the next round.“Just imagine, you have an election campaign. You run all over the country. You kiss babies you eat poor food, and then you oust yourself. It doesn’t make any sense,” he said. “But then one day we found out this convention is not valid any more. We kind of crossed the Rubicon. We crossed it twice. And what I’m afraid of is that we can much more easily cross it again. Once you realise the sky doesn’t fall, you can do it again and again.”While this cyclical show continues in the Knesset for months, Netanyahu continues running the country as an interim leader even though his previous term has ended and he faces three major criminal indictments, including the charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. The prime minister has denied all allegations.“No one can legitimately say he can replace him until there is someone who is elected. Netanyahu is kind of the default in this situation,” said Rahat. “Theoretically, it can go on for ever.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/982ce517c887c1f7390a710369dc58c51b4a95d0/110_0_2032_1219/master/2032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b9c6d7c083768e7a671aeb715411013","title":"li zehuajournalist wouldnt stay quiet covid 19 coronavirus","story":"Li Zehua is missing, presumed detained. He’s one of many for whom the coronavirus crisis has led to a political awakening and a demand for free speechLi Zehua, 25, a citizen journalist in Wuhan, is being chased. Wearing a facemask underneath a baseball cap, he quickly records a video while driving. “I’m on the road and someone, I don’t know, state security, has started chasing me,” he says breathlessly. “I’m driving very fast. Help me.”Later, Li posts a live stream of himself in an apartment, waiting for those same agents to knock on his door, probably to detain him. In an impassioned monologue, he explains why he quit a stable job at China’s state broadcaster, CCTV, and how he came to Wuhan on his own.“I don’t want to remain silent, or shut my eyes and ears. It’s not that I can’t have a nice life, with a wife and kids. I can. I’m doing this because I hope more young people can, like me, stand up,” he says. The live stream, posted on Weibo, where it was later deleted, and on YouTube, shows two men in plain clothes entering the apartment and then cuts out.As the number of new coronavirus infections inside China has slowed, authorities say the outbreak will reach its peak by the end of the month and any economic shock caused by an almost two-month nationwide shutdown will be limited. The propaganda machine has gone into overdrive, highlighting the government’s handling and the hard work of health workers and citizens.But for many, especially young people like Li, the damage is done. A growing number have not only become disenchanted with their government, ruled by the powerful Communist party, but are calling for changes such as free speech and government accountability. Some are calling it a political awakening – a provocative term in a country where any sign of dissent is quickly shut down.“In the past, I was afraid of running into trouble so I didn’t speak up much. Now I will speak out much more,” said Krejerk Liu, 30, who runs a bar in Beijing. He posts articles and opinions online and is increasingly critical of the government. “For me, being awake means I must keep speaking and keep seeing.”More than 2,000 people have died from the virus in China, which has infected almost 80,000. Almost every citizen has been affected whether in Wuhan struggling to save a family member amid overrun hospitals, labyrinthine bureaucracy and supply shortages, or quarantined at home, worried about the virus and when their lives can return to normal. Anger at the authorities has only solidified, helped by a steady stream of accounts of desperate families and health workers in Wuhan, allegations of corruption among state-run charities, and videos and photos of ordinary residents abused by local authorities in the name of epidemic prevention.The financial news outlet Caixin reported last week that authorities had ordered the destruction of samples collected from infected patients in December – and the loss of valuable information about the virus. Health commission officials also ordered scientists to stop testing, and institutions not to release information. “The epidemic has exposed this country completely in its corruption, bureaucracy, information control and censorship,” said Phillip Wu, 25, a freelance writer in Beijing. For many, the turning point came on 6 February, when Li Wenliang, a doctor-turned-whistleblower – and national hero – died from the virus that he had tried to warn colleagues about. Many see themselves in Li, a regular citizen who was punished by police for trying to speak out. One of his last comments – that “a healthy society should have more than one voice” – has become a mantra for continued calls for free speech.“Li Wenliang’s death was an earthquake that actually almost brought people out to the streets. It’s a shame we couldn’t,” said Meredith Yang, 27, who lives in Wuhan and commemorated him alone in a park, throwing a flower into a pond. “I thought: ‘Why are good, decent people treated this way and those who control this state machine are safe?’”Internet users have devised new ways to evade censors, including posting photographs of pieces of text and marking up the images. Some are teaching others about how to use virtual private networks (VPNs) to get over China’s Great Fire Wall and access blocked foreign sites. An army of volunteers has been preserving and organising videos, testimonies and reports by Chinese media.“Whenever you see a post that is at all critical of the government, your first instinct isn’t to read it but to immediately take a screenshot. I guess you could say this is the ‘weapon of the weak’ right now,” said Deng, 24, an anthropology student from Guiyang in the south-west.More are turning to encrypted platforms such as Telegram and Signal to voice opinions that would probably get their WeChat accounts shut down. A graphic passed around on WeChat included the QR codes for Telegram and Github, used to archive content censored within China, with the words: “Without free speech there is no point in speaking.” On Douban, a discussion forum, users frustrated with their posts being deleted called for a boycott under the hashtag: “I don’t understand, I don’t support” – a reference to the statement police forced Li Wenliang to sign, promising not to “spread rumours”.“Never before have I seen any other issue awaken ordinary people like this. People now know freedom of speech is the basis of protecting society. We can call this a seed – a formidable and vital seed,” said Hu Jia, a veteran civil rights activist based in Beijing.Episodes of public outrage are not uncommon in China, but criticism of the political system, which has become even more centralised under Xi Jinping, is normally rare among the public. Over the past month, a 2017 book called The Institutional Logic of Governance in China: An Organizational Approach by Zhou Xueguang, a professor at Stanford, has suddenly become popular.In an interview translated into Chinese but later blocked, Zhou blamed country’s top-down decision-making. “This is not only an outbreak of a novel virus it’s also a manifestation of the breakdown of China’s governance structures,” he said. “The crisis has exposed the cracks in the system.”Aware of these fissures, Zhao Kezhi, the minister of public security, said at a meeting last week that the country must “prioritise the maintenance of political security” during the epidemic and guard against “disruptive activities carried out by hostile forces at home and abroad”.Officials have launched a “positive energy” propaganda drive, ranging from pledges from senior leaders, including Xi, to donate personal funds to help fight the virus, to emotive stories about the sacrifices of frontline medics. The effort has fallen flat. Internet users responded with such scorn to two recent mascots created by the Communist Youth League that the campaign was dropped.“They feel deeply that this time really could lead to a bigger problem for them,” said Hu Jia, referring to China’s top leaders. “A thousand-mile dyke can collapse because of one ant-hole. They are afraid this will be the crack that causes the whole dam to break.” Activists and critics say the prospect of protests on the street is still remote, but China’s leaders, aware of the dangerous potential, are moving quickly to shut down this wave of public discontent. After a brief window of openness for Chinese media, censors have begun to crack down again. Two other citizen journalists in Wuhan, Chen Qiushi and Fang Bin, have gone missing while legal scholar Xu Zhiyong, who called Xi “clueless” in an open letter and asked him to step down, has been detained.But more repression may not work. “Public anger at the government is much bigger than in any earlier crises, and the anger could grow when the economic fallout of the epidemic fully unfolds,” said Ho-Fung Hung, a professor in political economy at Johns Hopkins University.“One thing for sure is that the social stability contract that has worked for so long – that the people tolerate the authoritarian rule so far as the government warrants economic prosperity and provides good governance – is broken in a big way,” he said.Li Zehua, who went to Wuhan in hopes of following in the footsteps of disappeared journalist Chen Qiushi, has yet to resurface. Li started a “self media” channel called Disobedience TV in 2018 and is sometimes criticised as naive or emotional. Yet he is also realistic. He says in his last video posting: “This isn’t about starting some kind of uprising.. That’s not it. I know idealism died that year, that spring” – an oblique reference to the wave of protests violently put down across China in 1989.Standing outside the door he asks whether the “two large guys” on the other side remember studying the Chinese writer Lu Xun in school. Quoting him, Li says: “There have always been those who fight for the people, who ram through obstacles and pursue truth at all costs … In these people we discover China’s backbone.”Additional reporting by Lillian Yang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58d3b969ba70831e9bacac5b029e22e68727365b/149_0_3630_2179/master/3630.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14bdd3673311e7052f1bfd89c15a4ffb","title":"coronavirus latest updates coronavirus live updates latest news china wuhan stock markets update china iran us australia south korea japan","story":"USA, Australia and Thailand report first deaths from coronavirus as two frontline doctors in China die and bans are put in place on large gatherings. Follow live newsThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the government is considering “all options” for tackling the spread of coronavirus.Speaking on Sky’s Sophy Ridge programme he described the outbreak as “a very, very significant challenge”.He said: “We are planning in case this gets much worse”. Hancock insisted ministers would put the safety of people first, but they did not want to unnecessarily hit the economy and society. We’re considering all options. At the moment the number of cases in this country is 23. And that means that so long as people are washing hands and taking the precautions that are set out that is the right thing to do. We don’t rule out taking any of these other measures. We will advice on those measures when it is right to take them because we want to minimise the economic and social disruption subject to keeping people safe.It’s a balancing act, where I place the greatest weight on keeping people safe. But there’s no point in doing things that aren’t clinically effective. We have to be guided by the science. The plan is very clear, firstly, to contain this virus, that’s the stage we’re in now. It means that every single case that is found here gets immediate treatment, but also we contact all of the people that that person has been in close contact with. Largely most of the cases so far, are from people who’ve caught the virus elsewhere and brought it here, and we’re then able to contain it.We’ve put £40m into trying to find a vaccine and also trying to improve the treatments for people who do have the disease. The experts say that a vaccine, even accelerated as fast as possible, is still many months off. But the potential for treatments that make the virus less of a problem if you’ve got it, they are more optimistic. The final plan is to prepare for mitigation should this become endemic in this country and making sure that not only the NHS is prepared, but also all parts of society. The government has got a huge role to play, but so does every single person.At the moment, the best thing people can do is make sure that they wash their hands for 20 seconds or more.

Hancock noted that stopping all flights from China, as pushed by some, had not proved successful for Italy, which is the worst affected country in Europe.Kuwait has confirmed a new case of coronavirus infection, bringing the total number of people diagnosed with the disease in the country to 46, a health ministry official told a press conference on Sunday, Reuters reports. The majority of the cases, including the one identified in the past 24 hours, are either people who had travelled to Iran or been in contact with people who were there, the official said.For the first time ever, Japan’s professional baseball teams staged pre-season opening games behind closed doors after the country dramatically escalated its response to coronavirus by closing schools and cancelling mass events.The condition of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman detained in Iran, is getting “worse and worse” but the Iranian authorities are still refusing to test her for coronavirus, her family has said.Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Richard said his wife’s guards were “keeping away” from her in case she has caught the disease. He said her “cold like symptoms that have got worse and worse and they’re not going away.” He said: “I’m sure the prison is not testing partly because there’s not many testing kits and partly because they don’t want to know”.The US, Australia and Thailand have reported their first deaths from coronavirus as two frontline doctors in China died and more countries put in place bans on large gatherings and travel restrictions.A 35-year-old male retail worker in Thailand died from Covid-19, according to the country’s department of disease control on Sunday. The man had also tested positive for dengue fever. In Australia, a 78-year-old man who was on the Diamond Princess cruise ship died in a hospital in western Australia. His wife has also contracted the virus.On Saturday, US officials said a man in his 50s in Washington state had died, after being tested for the disease on Thursday. Authorities said they did not know how he had contracted the virus because he did not have any history of travel to affected areas or contact with known Covid-19 cases.On Sunday, China reported its sharpest increase in new infections in a week with 573 new cases, the highest daily rise in a week. Chinese health authorities reported 35 new deaths on Sunday, a drop from the previous day’s toll of 47.A 32-year old doctor named Zhong Jinxing in the southern province of Guangxi who reportedly died from “overwork” on Friday after working for 33 consecutive days.

It comes after a further three people in England tested positive for the virus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the UK to 23. Two of the patients had recently travelled back from Italy, while the other had returned from Asia, according to the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty.You can get up to speed on all our coverage on the links below:A young woman in her 20s in Mexico has tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of cases for the country to four.

He’s one of many for whom the coronavirus crisis has led to a political awakening and a demand for free speech.“I don’t want to remain silent, or shut my eyes and ears. It’s not that I can’t have a nice life, with a wife and kids. I can. I’m doing this because I hope more young people can, like me, stand up,” he says. The live stream, posted on Weibo, where it was later deleted, and on YouTube, shows two men in plain clothes entering the apartment and then cuts out.An interesting report from Reuters, about Indonesia, which continues to say it has seen no cases, despite some infections around the world linked to travel to or through Bali:Indonesia has the resources to cope with a coronavirus outbreak, the director of its leading infectious diseases hospital said, defending detection procedures in the Southeast Asian nation of more than 260 million, where no cases have been reported. The world’s fourth most populous nation has tested 141 suspected cases, a small figure for its population, sparking concern among some medical professionals of a lack of vigilance and a risk of undetected cases. Neighbouring Malaysia has reportedly run about 1,000 tests, and Britain more than 10,000.“We can’t doubt our skills and the facts we gather,” said Muhammad Syahril, director of the Sulianti Saroso hospital in Jakarta, the capital, when asked why Indonesia had detected no cases. “If we don’t have cases, we don’t have cases,” he said in an interview at the hospital on Friday. “Why would we cover it up?” A man in his 70s died on Japan’s northernmost island of Hokkaido on Saturday night after testing positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, local authorities said on Sunday.The municipal government of Hokkaido said the patient was hospitalised on Jan. 17 for another disease, but started to show flu-like symptoms a few weeks later and tested positive for the coronavirus on Feb. 25. Public broadcaster NHK and other local media said authorities suspect the man may have caught the virus while in hospital. The man’s death marks the sixth fatality from Covid-19 in Japan, excluding six deaths among those aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess.The coronavirus outbreak in Hong Kong has not reached its peak yet, he Dean of the University of Hong Kong’s Faculty of Medicine, Professor Gabriel Leung, warned on Sunday.RTHK reports Leung said it was too soon to tell when the outbreak would be end, and people should remain vigilant.“The rest of the world actually views Hong Kong, along with Singapore, as the gold standard in epidemic control,” he said. “If you look at these two places, we have very similar absolute numbers of confirmed cases, yet we have a population that is one third bigger then Singapore, so - on a per capita basis - we’re not doing too badly.”Hong Kong has reported 95 cases and two deaths.Samsung Electronics has closed one of its factories in South Korea, according to Yonhap news agency.The mobile device factory in Gumni, near Davey, was closed after a worker tested positive for the coronavirus.It has been closed for a short time last month after an earlier case was discovered. Churches were closed in South Korea on Sunday with many holding online services instead, as authorities fought to rein in public gatherings, with 376 new coronavirus infections taking the tally to 3,526 cases.That came a day after the biggest daily jump of 813 cases in South Korea’s battle with the largest virus outbreak outside China, said the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), which will update numbers later in the day.The death toll of 17 was unchanged from Saturday, it added. In Seoul, the capital, about a dozen worshippers were turned away from the Yoido Full Gospel Church, which put a sermon for its 560,000 followers on YouTube, filmed with a small choir instead of all 200 members and 60-strong orchestra. “I had heard there would be no service, but just came to check as I live nearby, but yes, it is so empty,” said one of them, Song Young-koo, as he left South Korea’s biggest church. “It’s a wise decision to do it online, since the virus would easily spread at mass gatherings and churches can be no exception.” Some more details on that death in Thailand.Citing an unnamed health official, Reuters is reporting that Thailand has seen its first Covid-19 death.I’ll be handing over to my colleague, Helen Davidson, shortly, but before that, here’s a summary of the top points so far.Thailand now has 42 cases of Covid-19, after a 21-year-old man tested positive on Saturday, the Bangkok Post reports. Sukhum Kanchanaphimai, the permanent secretary for public health, said the man’s job brought him into contact with foreign tourists and he fell ill on 24 February, before seeking treatment the following day. He’s currently in hospital in Bangkok.The country has not reported any deaths from the virus but, as of Sunday, authorities will have greater powers to act after the Public Health Ministry designated Covid-19 a dangerous communicable disease.Tourism in many parts of Thailand has suffered, with travellers curtailing their journeys amid fears of the virus’s spread. American Airlines will suspend all US flights to Milan. It announced the move just hours after the US State Department said it was raising its travel warning for parts of Italy due to the coronavirus outbreak to Level 4 or “do not travel”. This covers travel to Lombardy and Veneto, in Italy’s north. American said it will suspend flights to and from Milan, from New York-JFK and Miami until 24 April, citing a reduction in demand. Vice President Mike Pence, who is heading the US response to the virus, said on Saturday that the State Department will work with Italy to coordinate medical screening of any iniduals coming to the United States.

How fair would it be to call the high, bare slopes of the hills “sheepwrecked”?This was a coinage from George Monbiot, radical columnist on ecological issues for the  newspaper. It headed a chapter in Feral, his book that urged “rewilding” of the upland ecosystems.Monbiot lived until recently at Machynlleth in Wales, below Cambrian mountains “grazed to destruction” and the source of both the Severn and Wye rivers. After previous Welsh floods, he dared to put the blame on the hill sheep. His comments on Countryfile raised a storm.This came to mind as I watched, appalled, the latest flooding of western UK. Both these islands share “extreme events” of unconscionable rainfall. An avalanche of soil unfurling on one Welsh hillside was so like the one that still scars the mountain round the corner in Killary harbour, opposite Leenane. Other Irish landslides have been far more damaging, and the Geological Survey has even mapped more potential sites.It has been three decades since I had to describe the severe overgrazing of western hills caused by the EU’s headage subsidies on unsustainable peatland. A great deal has changed since then, in reduction of sheep numbers, environmental grant schemes and enlightened local initiatives.The fabric of the hills has been slow to repair, as Nardus and Molinia grasses hold their grasp. Whole communities of mosses and liverworts have gone. Heather creeps back on the drier ground. but rarely to the height or luxuriance that once soaked up the rain and sheltered coveys of red grouse. For that, one has to visit, say, the protected slopes of Connemara National Park. Profound changeA different but equally profound change is the current exodus from hill farming. The toll of ageing aside, this is blamed on falling incomes. A study for the Irish Uplands Forum has found these well below the average industrial wage and almost wholly composed of basic EU farm payments. The bulk of sheep, however, are still held on the western seaboard and on uplands in the south and east. More than 800,000 head are mountain ewes. As ageing farmers drop out, their land is often annexed into neighbouring “ranches”.A concern expressed by Teagasc researchers is that “vast tracts of commonage will become . . . completely abandoned” because their condition is seen as agriculturally worthless. Neither the EU nor Teagasc can bear the thought of uplands smothered ungrazably with unmanaged heather, gorse, willow scrub or trees – all vegetation that might be expected to hold back the rain.For many ecological enthusiasts, leaving “vast tracts” of Irish hills to nature, or restoring them with native trees, would be ideal. New woodlands of Scots pine, birch and sessile oak flourish in their dreams.Before the postglacial climate change, many centuries ago, brought its own relentless rains, Scots pine was the dominant tree of the uplands, but there’s no chance of its unaided regeneration. One man in Co Wicklow carries a bunch of pine seedlings on his hill walks and plants them where he can, protected inside little barricades of rocks.Enduring fantasySome of the growing legion of hillwalkers might, perhaps, be moved to read The Man Who Planted Trees, Jean Giono’s enduring fantasy, and carry a pocketful of sprouted acorns of the native sessile oak. Prodded deep into any likely crevice of mineral soil, who knows? Until, I fear, the first snip from a passing sheep. Meanwhile, treeless blanket peat has absorbent values of its own, soaking up both water and atmospheric carbon. In his book Feral, Monbiot was irked to find the EU opposing upland tree planting on the grounds that it would release too much carbon from the soil. One of many objectives in a new “Wild Atlantic Nature” project, backed by the EU Life programme, is “removal of encroaching trees and shrubs” from blanket peatland in protected areas along the Wild Atlantic Way. These, no doubt, would include rhododendron and the lodgepole pines self-sown from ageing Coillte forestry.“Restoring” the bogs in 24 SACs along the Wild Atlantic Way faces a pessimistic description from the National Parks and Wildlife Service and a lack of any national conservation plan for blanket bogs, even in protected areas.The project lists the causes of damage: “Centuries of peat cutting, reclamation, burning, drainage and invasive species. In more recent decades afforestation, over- or under-grazing, recreation and infrastructural developments . . . ”Add in “low levels of public appreciation” of how peatland matters to climate change, or why communities should feel a caring ownership for the local bog, and you might wonder where to start."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing. Maybe they have done all of this but there isn’t enough information available, and if they haven’t done it, why not?”Keep awayMs Dubsky said despite local restrictions, efforts would be made by environmentalists to examine limpets, a marine mollusc, on rocks in the area to see if they are falling off.Members of the public have again been urged to stay away from the wreck which is on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and in an unstable condition.As part of the operation, access to a local cul-de-sac road has been restricted to residents. The council has also said that lands along the shoreline are private.Under law, it is an offence for anyone to interfere with a wreck or to attempt to board it.A Revenue official has been appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Department of Transport, a function necessary to manage the possession and disposal of vessels which wash ashore."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4189346.1583054131!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus health officials try to track down people in contact with republic s first case","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer of the  Department of Health during a press briefing on Friday. Photograph: CollinsThe first case of coronavirus has been confirmed in the Republic of Ireland, the Department of Health said on Saturday.The patient, a male in the eastern part of the country, is currently receiving “appropriate medical care”. “The patient was identified and tested in line with established protocols for the investigation of suspect cases of Covid-19,” the department said in a statement.“The case is associated with travel from an affected area in northern Italy, rather than contact with another confirmed case.”Speaking at a press briefing in Dublin on Saturday night, officials said the process of getting in touch with people who were in close contact with the man is just beginning.“This process will take some time, but the people who need to be contacted will be contacted,” said Dr John Cuddihy, director of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.The person who had contracted the disease followed the advice of public health authorities and identified himself, enabling the diagnosis to be made, chief medical officer at the Department of Health, Dr Tony Holohan said.“We are confident the systems we have in place, and that we’ve worked on for months, will work well,” he said.Officials declined to specify the nationality of the person, whether he travelled on public transport, what airport he used, whether he travelled alone and whether this case is connected to the case reported in the North several days ago.Dr Holohan said officials had to be careful about the amount of information provided. The reason for not providing more information was to protect the identity of the person affected and to avoid the person being identified publicly. This would lead to a feeling among the public that their privacy would not be protected in the event that they contacted the disease.Dr Holohan, said the case was not a surprise and had not changed the view of officials about containing the disease. “There is still a high likelihood of containing the spread of this disease. We still have a high degree of confidence. The change of developing the disease in this country is extremely low”.On Sunday morning the HSE said in a tweet that “the risk to the general public is still low. This risk may change. People may continue to go to work, school, as usual.”Up to last Friday, 115 tests had been carried out on suspected cases of the coronavirus, but all proved negative up to that point. The Department of health said Minister for Health Simon Harris had been informed of the case and has notified Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Speaking on Saturday, Mr Harris said: “This is not unexpected. We have been preparing for this since January. “I would strongly encourage people to follow the guidance and advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team, led by the chief medical officer.”Conference callMr Varadkar and Mr Harris earlier held a conference call with their counterparts in Northern Ireland on Saturday as the unidentified woman in Northern Ireland who recently came home from Italy and was suspected of being infected with the Covid-19 or new coronavirus, had her case confirmed.Mr Varadkar and Mr Harris were joined on the call by Ireland’s deputy chief medical officer, Northern Ireland’s First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill, health minister Robin Swann, and the Northern Ireland chief medical officer, the Government said in a statement.They discussed the situation regarding the virus on the island of Ireland, and also internationally, and noted the good co-operation in place between authorities north and south of the Border.All agreed to continue the close co-operation and to remain in close contact in the period ahead, the statement said.On Saturday the NI Public Health Agency (PHA) said it had received notification from its counterparts in England that the one presumptive case of coronavirus in Northern Ireland had been confirmed by the reference laboratory it was sent to. The family at the centre of the case has asked that their privacy is respected given the personal impact of this issue, a PHA statement said.The public in Northern Ireland have been advised that they have full access to the National Health Service’s 111 helpline, though the British service is only being made available for people from Northern Ireland in relation to coronavirus guidance and not for other conditions.Sinn Féin MLA Colm Gildernew welcomed the high-level meeting. The party health spokesman said: “It is essential that public health authorities north and south work closely together and co-operate and community effectively in order to deal with this health emergency.“Infections don’t recognise barriers or borders and neither should our approach.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"People in contact with man who travelled from Italy to be identifiedPassenger fatally injured crash Sunday morning in Porridgetown, OughterardHundreds still without power weather to see mix of sunny spells and showersGarda\u0026iacute discover quantities of heroin and cocaine during searches of car and residenceThousands left without power as Met \u0026Eacuteireann issues series of wind and rain alertsBaby Jensen arrives just seven minutes into February 29th\u0026lsquoThat is not Tullamore\u0026rsquo: Locals voice support for plan to house asylum seekersFatal road incidents occurred in counties Louth, Monaghan and Cavan since FridayGarda\u0026iacute say no injuries after incident near Maam CrossOrganisation says governments need to wake up before disease spirals out of controlDaniel Grainger found following public appeal for informationSupplements may slightly reduce heart disease while marginally increasing prostate cancer riskHouse in Coolock Village on Friday night man currently detained in Ballymun Garda stationStatus red, the highest level warning, issued for Clare and Galway as winds batter countryThe most hated man in rural Ireland? \u0027It\u0027s wrong\u0027, says the defeated MinisterMark Condren named press photographer of the yearInidual speaker\u0026rsquos award goes to Rachael Mullally representing UCD LawDriver and passenger pronounced dead at scene of collision with jeep on Friday eveningStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4187838.1582894224!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus advice wash your hands and avoid hugging kissing and hand shaking","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A spectator wears a face mask at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis ATP Championships  in Dubai. Photograph: Ali HaiderEPAWith the coronavirus spreading rapidly across the world and one case now confirmed on the island of Ireland, much of the focus is on how to deal with the illness and care for the sick.But equally important, if not more important, in what is still a containment phase is how to minimise the odds of contracting the virus and stay safe as the illness spreads.The first and best advice is not to panic. Hysteria is a real enemy in a situation like this.“We are actually in a very delicate situation in which the outbreak can go in any direction based on how we handle it,” World Health Organisation head Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus said on Thursday night. “This is not a time for fear. This is a time for taking action to prevent infection and save lives now,” he added.There has been a huge amount of speculation about the illness, much of which is ill-informed or speculative but what we know for certain now is that the Covid-19 coronavirus is new and scientists are assessing how it spreads.We also know that similar viruses tend to spread via cough and sneeze droplets.’Social distancing’That is why so-called “social distancing” will be important in the days ahead. That means you should move at least a metre away from anyone who appears ill if you can. Avoid shaking hands or hugging or kissing people as part of a greeting.There has also been a lot of talk in recent days about face masks and alcohol based hand sanitisers but - by far - the most effective way to protect yourself is by regularly washing your hands.At the risk of stating the obvious, a quick rinse under the tap doesn’t get rid of dangerous germs. Hands need to be vigourously washed with soap and hot water for at least 20 seconds or the length of time it takes to sing the Happy Birthday song twice.Many people don’t dry their hands either which is why it is important to remember that damp actually can help germs to breed and allows them to spread more easily onto whatever you touch next.According to advice from the HSE, in addition to hand-washing people should also use alcohol based hand sanatisers if necessary.It is also important to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve when you cough and sneeze and to put used tissues into a bin and then wash your hands again. People should not touch their eyes, nose or mouth if their hands are not cleanThe HSE advice also reminds people to clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.With regard to face masks the HSE advice is simple. People who are well or have no symptoms of illness should not use them. “There’s no evidence that using masks is of any benefit if you are not sick,” it says.People who should use face masks if they have or may have coronavirus or if they are in close contact with someone who has or may have coronavirus or if they are are a healthcare worker in close contact with people who have or may have coronavirus.Healthcare workersAccording to the HSE people who work in a healthcare setting can best protect themselves by regularly washing their hands and covering their mouths and noses when coughing and sneezing.Health care professionals dealing with cases or suspected cases of the coronavirus are being advised to wear personal protective equipment which includes a surgical face mask, a face shield or goggles, gloves and a clean, non-sterile, disposable long-sleeved gown. “If this is not available, wear a plastic apron and roll up sleevesIrish people displayed a propensity to stockpile during the two or three days that the beast from the east made its presence felt two years ago.Bread supplies dried up and fresh meat and dairy disappeared from supermarkets as supply chains displayed a worrying fragility.Will something similar happen if panic about the coronavirus mounts? Possibly.Certainly in other locations concerns over shortages have led some people to stockpile and there has been evidence of panic buying.Already in this country all the face masks have disappeared from pharmacies and even hardware shops.“I don’t think it is necessary, and I certainly don’t advise it,” Mark Woolhouse at the University of Edinburgh to New Scientist this week.Food suplyJennifer Nuzzo at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, Maryland told the same magazine that people should ensure they have at least three days’ food supply to hand as they are advised to do during hurricanes. “I’m not saying it’s specifically necessary in this case,” she said.Meanwhile virology blogger Ian Mackay recommended slowly building up a “pandemic stash”.Certainly do not stock up on prescription medicines - not only will you almost certainly not need them but you may make it harder for those that do need them to access them. Which takes us back to the start and the best advice which is don’t panic.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4189351.1583050361!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"joe biden wins crucial south carolina primary ahead of super tuesday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Democratic presidential candidate  Joe Biden celebrates with his supporters after declaring victory at an election-night rally at the University of South Carolina Volleyball Center on Saturday. Photograph: Scott OlsonGetty ImagesFormer US vice president Joe Biden has won the South Carolina primary- a crucial victory for the 78-year-old Democratic candidate ahead of Super Tuesday in two days’ time. Mr Biden clocked up a better-than-expected victory in the southern state, clinching almost 50 per cent of the vote. The strong performance by the former vice president has imbued his campaign with a much-needed boost as the Democratic campaign enters a decisive phase with 14 states and one US territory due to vote on Tuesday. South Carolina - the fourth state to hold its selection process after Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada - also has the largest African-American population of the early-voting states. 55 per cent of voters in South Carolina on Saturday were African-Americans, with 61 per cent of this cohort voting for Mr Biden. The former vice president won every county in the state, indicating the breadth of his support in South CarolinaSpeaking to supporters in Columbia, Mr Biden thanked the voters of South Carolina for backing him. “Just days ago, the press and the pundits had declared this candidacy dead,” he declared. “Now thanks to all of you - the heart of the Democratic party - we’ve just won and we won big because of you, and we are very much alive.”He also made a barely-veiled dig at front runner Bernie Sanders, asserting that Americans did not want a revolution but instead wanted “results.” “If Democrats want a nominee who’s a Democrat, a lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat, join us,” he said to cheers. “We have the option of winning big or losing big. That’s the choice.”Mr Biden’s commanding victory now puts him close behind Mr Sanders in the Democratic race. But he faces a tough battle on Tuesday when several states, including California and Texas, hold their primaries. Polling suggests that Mr Sanders is on course to win California - the largest state in the union with a coveted 415 pledged delegates - and possibly Texas, though Mr Biden has been polling better in the state and is due to campaign there on Monday. Mr Biden is also polling relatively well in southern states voting on Tuesday such as Virginia and Alabama. The result of the South Carolina primary is also raising fresh questions about the viability of some candidates. Both Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigeg finished poorly in South Carolina - at 3 per cent and 7 per cent respectively, increasing pressure on Ms Klobuchar in particular to drop out. Despite Mr Buttigieg’s poor performance in South Carolina - he won just 3 per cent of the African-American vote - his victory in Iowa means that he is still in third place after Mr Sanders and Mr Biden in terms of pledged delegates - the delegates that states send to the Democratic National Convention in July. Tom Steyer, the billionaire businessman who finished in third place at 11 per cent in South Carolina having spent millions of advertising dollars in the state, suspended his campaign on Saturday night, stating that he could not see a path forward to the nomination. Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York who has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in advertisement, was not on the ballot in South Carolina but is contesting Super Tuesday states - the results will offer the first indication of his level of support in the country. On Sunday night Mr Bloomberg is due to air a new primetime three-minute ad addressing his ability to deal with the coronavirus. Mr Sanders’ surge in the first three primary states, had sparked alarm among many on the moderate side of the Democratic party that the high number of candidates is effectively splitting the non-Sanders vote. Mr Biden’s resolute victory on Saturday in South Carolina could underscore his argument that he is the best person to take on Mr Sanders. The Vermont senator, who won the nomination contests in New Hampshire, Nevada, and the popular vote in Iowa, responded to his second-place showing in South Carolina at a rally in Virginia, one of the Super Tuesday states. “There are a lot of states in this country. No one wins them all,” he said to his supporters. “I want to congratulate Joe Biden tonight.” But he urged his supporters to look ahead to Super Tuesday, where he is well-placed to win a number of states, building in part on his growing popularity among Hiic voters. Tweeting late on Saturday after the Biden victory was announced, President Donald Trump tweeted: “Congratulations to Sleepy Joe Biden!”In a separate tweet he claimed that Democrats were “working hard to destroy the name and reputation of Crazy Bernie Sanders, and take the nomination away from him!”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest

empire, now it is the emperor himself campaigners want back.Diplomatic debate has long raged over returning alleged historic plunder like the Elgin Marbles.A clause covering these supposed imperial spoils has even appeared in negotiations between the UK and EU.Now French historians have demanded the repatriation of Napoleon III whose remains are in a tomb in a church in Hampshire.France’s final monarch died in exile and was laid to rest in Farnborough 147 years ago.Historians in France hope to secure the ultimate artefact of imperialism and have Bonaparte’s body returned as part of deals being made in the wake of Brexit.Historians in France hope to secure the ultimate artefact of imperialism and have Bonaparte’s body returned as part of deals being made in the wake of Brexit.A request has been sent to the Foreign Office asking Government to consider Napoleon III, nephew of the bellicose emperor defeated at Waterloo, in any future negotiations over returning cultural treasures. The leader founded France’s Second Empire and presided over what many see as a Gallic golden age before his ignominious defeat to Prussia. French historian Dimitri Casali is leading calls for the symbol of his nation\u0027s glory to be brought home, and has formally asked the UK Government to consider the emperor\u0027s repatriation. This follows the EU adding an Elgin Marbles clause to its demands for a post-Brexit trade deal, and it is hoped a spirit of international amity will prevail“This is the moment,” Mr Casali told The Daily .  “I think it’s a gesture, the body of Napoleon III could be a sign.   “It will be an elegant gesture of reconciliation between England and France. “We created the Entente Cordiale.  Perhaps this could be the second Entente Cordiale.  It could be a sign of solidarity.”Napoleon III was laid to rest in St Michael\u0027s Abbey, Farnborough, three years after he was defeated by Otto von Bismarck and fled across the Channel.  His wife Eugenie is buried nearby.  As president and then as monarch he supervised vast imperial and economic expansion, along with a cultural flowering and the beautification of Paris.  Some academic voices in France argue the emperor should be returned to his glittering imperial city as a grand symbol to educate and inspire the nation far more than the banal figures of politics. “He was a very, very great man,” said Mr Casali.  “It’s very important for France to have the body of Napoleon III.“England has their Royal Family, but we have nobody, we have Macron.“France had been a monarchy for 1,000 years before it was a republic.  He represented the republic and monarchy.”Mr Casali, who has support from other academics, has requested that the Foreign Office consider the emperor\u0027s entombed body in future diplomacy between the UK and EU nations.It comes after the EU added a clause to its trade demands some believe could pave the way for the Elgin Marbles to return to the Parthenon.The clause says negating parties should “address issues relating to the return or restitution of unlawfully removed cultural objects to their countries of origin.While the famous marbles may return to Athens, Saint-Augustin in Paris has been suggested as a fitting final resting place for the exiled emperor, who was in power from 1848 to 1870. There is no more space next to his uncle, who was returned after his own death in exile, in Les Invalides. It is understood from the Ministry of Justice that the Catholic monastic community in which Napoleon III currently rests would have to give their consent for his removal. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking

a contagious person is unaware they are infectious.The patient became the first person to catch the illness within the UK, prompting claims it represented a new phase in the spread of the disease.As the number of people in the UK infected with Covid-19 rose yesterday to 23, the Surrey case remains the only one where the patient, understood to be male, has not become infected after travelling abroad to virus hotspots.The Department of Health and Social Care, NHS England and Public Health England last night refused to confirm whether a Surrey-based doctor who may have treated the patient was taken to a specialist unit on Friday after showing symptoms of the virus. Although he has not yet been formally diagnosed with the condition, the Haslemere Health Centre in the county temporarily closed to the public following a deep clean. It reopened yesterday, shortly before Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary and South West Surrey MP, said on Twitter he was “thinking of clinicians, staff and patients at the surgery during this worrying time.He added: Thoughts today with new Covid19 patient and local GP with symptoms alongside their families.It is believed the Surrey doctor has a wife who also works as a medic. It is not known whether she has shown any symptoms or is ‘self-isolating’ as a precaution.A number of staff at the Haslemere GP surgery who were contacted by the Sunday  refused to comment. One employee simply said: “I’m not allowed to say anything. I really don’t want to get into trouble.”The prospect of a doctor being infected is of particular concern because it is likely he or she would have close contact with vulnerable patients attending appointments. The focus on Surrey intensified yesterday when The Prince of Wales, a pub in Haslemere, announced it had closed “until further notice” for a “deep clean” after a “customer who visited tested positive for coronavirus”.In a statement posted on social media, the landlords Nick and Becky added: “We are all well, no symptoms. This is purely a precautionary measure. We are just trying to do our bit to help.”It is not known whether that customer was the Surrey patient who may have gone to the Haslemere health centre.Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, said it was not clear if the Surrey man had contracted the virus directly or indirectly from somebody who had recently travelled abroad.Ruth Hutchinson, Surrey County Council’s interim director of public health, said she was in continuous contact with Public Health England, adding that those not contacted by either organisation should “go about their life as normal but take extra care to follow public health advice … to help reduce the risk of infection.” If it is confirmed a Surrey doctor has the virus he would be the second GP to contract the illness. The first was a medic in Brighton who worked at Worthing hospital.Of the three cases announced yesterday, two had returned from Italy and the other from Asia. Officials are trying to trace who they had contact with. The patients are from Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire and Berkshire.Tonight a staff member at Willow Bank Infant School, in Reading, Berkshire, was revealed to have tested positive for the virus.In an email sent to parents on Saturday night they were urged to stay calm and follow recommended hygiene procedures.The school, in the suburb of Woodley, is to be given a deep clean and will be closed for a few days amid growing fears there will be a wider outbreak.The email, from head teacher Michelle Masters, states: “We regret to inform you that we were told today that one of our members of staff has tested positive for the Coronavirus, Covid-19.The school will be shut for some days to allow for a deep clean and to ensure that the risks of infection remain low.We will be in contact to ensure that you are kept updated.“I am sure you will join with me to wish the affected member of staff all the very best for a speedy recovery.”The Foreign Office confirmed it was supporting the family of a British man, believed to be in his 70s who lived abroad, who became the first UK citizen to die from the virus.The man, who was on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined off Japan\u0027s coast, was the sixth person from the vessel to have died.David Abel and his wife Sally were both on board that ship and now undergoing treatment for the virus in hospital. They took to social media to express their sadness that a fellow British holidaymaker had died.In a YouTube video Mr Abhel said: Sad news this morning, wasn\u0027t it? We awakened to that, to hear that one of the Brits has sadly passed away in hospital out here in Japan.Our thoughts, our concern is for all of the families left behind. We are fortunate, we\u0027re doing OK, we\u0027re being really, really well cared for.More than 700 tourists have become infected on the Diamond Princess.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"met new york updating british galleries show wealth built slave","story":"The dark side of the British Empire and its foundation on slavery and cheap labour is being emphasised in a major revamp of one of the world’s greatest museums.New York’s politan Museum of Art has redesigned its British galleries to highlight the troubled history of the empire as a way of illustrating this country’s rich tradition of arts and crafts.The galleries, which open to the public on Monday as part of the Met’s 150-year anniversary program, hold a rich display of British decorative arts, design and sculpture from the 400-year period between Henry VII and Queen Victoria, including a large collection of teapots and china figurines.The museum says it has made its collection “relevant to a contemporary audience” by  emphasizing the development and growth of the British Empire “with all of its systems of exploitation”.Wolf Burchard, the Met’s curator, told artnet news: “For all the beauty of these objects, the British empire was the backbone of the British economy and the funds made available to produce these things is in part due to the empire and the slave trade—and you have to acknowledge that.”One gallery, devoted to “Tea, Trade, and Empire”, explores the period with 100 English teapots displayed in a pair of ten-foot-tall semicircular cases.In another section an anti-slavery medallion made by the Wedgwood pottery workshop, showing a man in shackles, appears alongside an 18th-century plan of a slave ship.Another display is a figure from 1719, produced in China by the Cantonese artist Amoy Chinqua, showing an East India Company entrepreneur whose imports from China, India, and the West Indies included tea, sugar, coffee, and chocolate, as well as porcelain, cotton, mahogany, and ivory, “produced at great material and human cost, and then transported thousands of miles” for the benefit of Britain’s new middle class.The Met’s publicity material for the display states: “The new narrative offers a chronological exploration of the intense commercial drive among artists, manufacturers, and retailers that shaped British design over the course of 400 years.“During this period, global trade and the growth of the British Empire fueled innovation, industry, and exploitation. Works on view illuminate the emergence of a new middle class—ready consumers for luxury goods—which inspired an age of exceptional creativity and invention during a time of harsh colonialism.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"michael bloomberg using digital media 2020 election","story":"The text message looked like ordinary political spam. Mike Bloomberg is the president we need to unite our country! it read. The next message, however, was more unusual: Please disregard. Vote Bernie or Warren.In fact these messages, first reported by the Los Angeles Times, were not sent by a campaign staffer or an enthusiastic volunteer. Instead they were the work of a financially stressed recent graduate from Sacramento, California, one of more than 500 Americans who have signed up to bombard their friends and social media followers with pro-Mike messages for a cool $2,500 (per month.This unusual scheme – a slightly cleaner and much more generous recreation of China\u0027s 50 cent army of pro-government online trolls – is part of an unprecedented digital advertising blitz from the former New York City mayor, who on Tuesday will formally enter the race to be chosen as the Democratic Party\u0027s nominee for US president. It is emblematic of a candidate who has sought to short-circuit the contest by carpet-bombing it with money from his gigantic personal fortune – but also one who has pushed the boundaries of what is permissible in a political campaign.Not that Bloomberg can\u0027t afford it. According to Forbes, he is the world\u0027s eighth richest man, with a net worth of around $60bn (compared to Donald Trump\u0027s $3.1bn) derived from an empire of financial data terminals. His pitch to voters is taht he is smarter, richer, more successful and far more sophisticated (though not taller) than the carnival barking clown currently occupying the White House, and that he is the boss who can whip America into shape. In practice, he has struggled for breathing space with a crowd of other Democratic moderates who have so far failed to unite against the surging, socialist Bernie Sanders. Still, though Bloomberg will only actually appear on ballots from Super Tuesday, when a huge number of delegates are up for grabs in 14 simultaneous state elections, he has already spent more cash on Facebook and Google adverts than every other major presidential candidate combined.The aim of this bonanza is to beat Trump\u0027s superlative 2016 effort, which Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth recently described as the single best digital ad campaign I\u0027ve ever seen from any advertiser. Or, as Bloomberg\u0027s campaign manager Kevin Sheekey put it last month: We’re gonna spend Trump out of office. The 78-year-old mogul has promised to keep up the shopping spree even if he loses the nomination (including to Sanders). But at times his tactics have bordered on spam, fake news and social media manipulation, leading one expert to accuse him of hacking your attention.In one case, Bloomberg\u0027s campaign sent out a clip of a TV debate which had been edited to make his opponents look far more stumped by one of his attack lines than they really were. Aides defended it as an obvious parody. In another, the campaign tweeted a series of satirical quotes from Sanders praising various dictators, only to delete them after a backlash. It also commissioned a horde of sponsored posts from Instagram influencers, flagrantly violating a ban on politicians running any such campaigns. After that, Instagram actually reversed the policy, and now asks only that candidates and their influencers flag the sponsorship using an official tool.Most controversially, Twitter last month banned 70 accounts that had tweeted identical pro-Bloomberg messages, accusing them of beaking platform manipulation rules originally designed to stop Russian influence campaigns. It is unclear whether these accounts were entirely fake identities or whether they were simply members of the $2,500 army who had copied the Bloomberg campaign\u0027s boilerplate messages instead of crafting their own. Neither Twitter nor the campaign responded to requests for comment.Yet according to Renee DiResta, a researcher at the Stanford Internet Observatory who has extensively studied Russian covert campaigns, Bloomberg\u0027s methods are drawn less from government government trolls and more from corporate shills. The comparison to Russia is so absurd, she says. The appropriate comparison is astroturfing, in which people are paid money by pharmaceutical companies or whatever to go onto social media and talk about how wonderful their headache medicine is. Normally the US would regulate that as a consumer protection issue  – but DiResta says that election authorities have failed to draw up matching rules for politicians.Groeling, meanwhile, argues that Bloomberg is embracing a tried-and-tested Trumpian tactic: trolling the media to pay attention to what he wants them to pay attention to. The edited video clip, for example, happened to feature Bloomberg\u0027s best moment in a debate that otherwise went badly for him, meaning he may have gained more positive spin from reports that questioned his tactics than from the clip itself. The same is true of Bloomberg\u0027s fake Sanders tweets: everyone who saw them being debunked was also exposed to the claim that Sanders supports dictators, even if they had never heard it before.In other words, Bloomberg might be the first truly post-Trump candidate: a rival oligarch, shameless about his wealth, who is willing to bend the truth and incite controversy in order to hijack the spotlight. Some have therefore feared that his victory would herald the end of American democracy as we know it. But Groeling is more optimistic: yes, Bloomberg has spent a staggering amount of money, but he is far away from actually winning Democratic voters and has suffered in every arena that he does not control.The true test of Bloomberg\u0027s plan will begin on Tuesday – and it may yet transpire that its only real winners are a handful of ordinary hustlers who will breathe more easily paying this month\u0027s rent.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands asylum seekers ferried eu border pawns turkeys political","story":"Thousands of migrants were trapped on Saturday in a squalid no-man\u0027s-land beyond Turkey\u0027s border with Greece, as the realisation dawned on them that they had become pawns in a political stunt hatched by the Turkish government.Huddled crowds from Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Syria gathered on a narrow road that sits between Turkish and Greek territory, their path to Europe blocked by razor wire and armed EU border guards.Less than 24 hours ago, many believed their prayers had been answered when the Turkish government announced it was opening its side of the border and laid on a fleet of unmarked, white buses to ferry migrants to its frontier with Greece. Now they are stuck in freezing temperatures with little food or water, resorting to pulling down tree branches for firewood and erecting makeshift tents, as it becomes clear that the path to Europe has been tightly sealed.Just yards away from angry confrontations between migrants and border guards, children no older than four or five, who were wrapped up in coats and wooly hats, ran around in the mud. A Greek government spokesman described the wave of migration as an onslaught, adding that it would do whatever it takes to protect its borders. And in Austria, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz hinted at border closures in the event that Greece failed to keep the crowds at bay.Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey\u0027s president, has long threatened to let refugees into Europe if they don\u0027t meet his demands. His latest move marks the most serious escalation in his attempts to secure more help from Europe and Nato in tackling the refugee crisis in Syria, where almost a million have fled war in Idlib province in recent weeks.   In a speech on Saturday Mr Erdoğan, Turkey\u0027s president, claimed that 18,000 people had amassed on the border and threatened to send a further 30,000.But in reality the number of people gathered at the main crossing, near the Turkish city of Edirne, appeared no higher than 5,000, while in nearby Ipsala a Turkish police officer said around 500 people had arrived.In what may soon become a sprawling refugee camp unless the crowds are dispersed by Turkish forces, women and children huddled around fires, masking their faces from the smoke.Rumours swirled at the border on Saturday about Turkish authorities transporting most of the migrants back to Istanbul at the end of the weekend, should Mr Erdogan feel his point has been made.The majority of those gathered in Edirne were young men, who angrily shouted at the Greek soldiers guarding their side of the border, behind a barbed-wire fence that stretched as far as the eye could see in each direction.Further south, dozens of migrants were attempting sea crossings to the Greek island of Lesbos in dinghies, with limited success.Some migrants claimed they had been beaten by Greek police, and that in at least one incident those who tried to cross into the EU had their shoes confiscated.Others told the Sunday  of their devastation as they realised they had been duped were now trapped at the border, Many who were unable to board free buses have resorted to paying taxi drivers around 100 lira (£12) and claim they are now out of money.Some migrants rode in on the back of pickup trucks driven by locals hoping to make some easy cash. Meanwhile, a group of taxi drivers bartered with migrants at a crossing near the Turkish town of Ipsala for transport back to Istanbul, after they gave up on entering Europe.Abdullah, an 18-year-old Afghan who came to Turkey with his five siblings six months ago, said they felt their hearts leap as they were waved across the Turkish side of the border, only to be greeted with barbed wire, soldiers and tear gas at the Greek side.We are devastated...we haven\u0027t even tried to cross again because we are too scared. One group today came back without any shoes, cell phones or bags. They were confiscated by the Greek police, he said.They lied to us, they said we could leave and now we are trapped here. We just want to go back to Ankara now but we don\u0027t have the money. I have no idea what to do.One Iranian refugee who said he was fleeing the theocracy in Tehran accused Mr Erdogan of ensuring him and his friends in a cruel political game, while two women from Somalia said they were ready to go back to Istanbul.Most of the people gathered at the border did not appear to have arrived from Syria\u0027s war-torn Idlib province, as they said they had already lived in Turkey without social security or ID cards for more than a year.We have been waiting for four years for this chance and now we are stuck here because the other side is closed, added an 18-year-old from Kabul who gave his name as Hourshid.We have jobs in Turkey but we left them to come here. Now I guess we have to go back.Since 2016, under the terms of the EU-Turkey migration deal, Ankara has been halting refugee flows towards the EU, which in turn agreed to give Turkey €3billion (£2.3 billion) and visa-free travel for Turkish citizens.Josep Borrell Fontelles, the EU\u0027s foreign policy chief, has said that the Turkish government has offered “reassurances” that Turkey intends to continue abiding by that agreement, even though its side of the border has been thrown open.As groups continued to arrive at Edirne on Saturday evening, Turkey continued to pile pressure on Western leaders for more military support on Syria and used the threat of more migration waves into Europe as a key bargaining chip.Mevlut Cavusoglu, the Turkish foreign minister, said the government has urged the United States to provide Patriot missiles as backup in northwestern Syria, following Syrian regime airstrikes this month which killed 55 Turkish soldiers.The Turkish president also called on Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, to step aside in Syria and allow Turkish forces to battle the Syrian regime alone.As night fell on Edirne, yet more migrants began to realise they had been duped as part of a cynical geopolitical game.As they trudged back through no-man\u0027s-land, they passed the sign in Turkish which had greeted them 24 hours earlier, when they were filled with false hope of safe passage to Europe.Turkey\u0027s border is its honour, the sign says.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"joe biden wins big south carolina bringing campaign back brink","story":"Joe Biden has overwhelmingly won the South Carolina primary, bringing his presidential bid back from the brink and giving him new momentum going into Super Tuesday. The former US vice president secured around half the vote in the state according to early counting, thanks in a large part to his vast support among African-American voters. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator and race front-runner, finished a distant second place.It is the first time Mr Biden has won a state in his three campaigns for the White House. For all those of you who\u0027ve been knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign, Mr Biden told jubilant supporters at a victory party in Columbia, South Carolina. Mr Biden took a swipe at pundits who had declared him “dead after poor performance in the early states, saying: We are very much alive... This campaign\u0027s just taking off!Mr Biden had spent all week in the state attempting to save his bid after fourth- and fifth-place finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, followed by a second place in Nevada last weekend.He had been the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination for more than a year before Iowa voted. The 77-year-old repeatedly played up the eight years he spent as Barack Obama\u0027s deputy, framing himself as the ultimate defender of the first black US president\u0027s legacy. In the South Carolina primary, unlike the early voting states, a majority of voters were African-American, a group with which Mr Biden had enjoyed a consistent lead in surveys. Exit polls showed that Mr Biden overwhelmingly won that demographic, picking up an estimated 60 per cent of votes from African Americans who cast a ballot. The polls also suggested that the endorsement of Jim Clyburn, the highest ranking African-American congressman, had been a significant factor for a sizable number of voters.Mr Sanders, a democratic socialist, finished second with around a fifth of the votes. His historic opposition to tighter gun laws and desire to challenge Mr Obama in 2012 for the presidential nomination had been targeted by the Biden campaign. Tom Steyer, the billionaire who poured millions into South Carolina and focussed on winning African-American support, was on course to finish a disappointing third. He announced his withdrawal from the race shortly after polls closed. Other candidates such as former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar were expected to finish with a vote share in the single digits when counting was complete. Mr Biden used his victory speech to repeatedly go after Mr Sanders, the candidate with the most delegates in the race so far, casting himself as the field\u0027s leading moderate. Folks, win big or lose, that is the choice. Most Americans don\u0027t want the promise of revolution. They don\u0027t want promises - they want results, he said. Mr Biden also said a Democrat should be the party\u0027s nominee - a jibe at Mr Sanders, who is an independent - and warned against factionalism.We can\u0027t have a never-ending war, he said. Any bounce Mr Biden hopes for could be short lived, however, with 14 states voting in just three days\u0027 time in what is dubbed Super Tuesday. Most of Mr Biden\u0027s rivals had already turned their attention to those races, flying out of South Carolina before results dropped on Saturday night. Some, especially those who have failed to finish in the top two in any of the first four states such as Ms Warren and Ms Klobuchar, are under mounting pressure to quit the race. Mike Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and billionaire who has spent hundreds of millions on his campaign, was not on the ballot in South Carolina, joining on Super Tuesday. He is under pressure to prove he is better positioned than Mr Biden to beat Mr Sanders, with critics saying he is splitting the centrist vote and easing the democratic socialist\u0027s path. There was jubilation at the sports centre in Columbia where hundreds of supporters had turned up to celebrate Mr Biden\u0027s win, with chants of Joe! Joe! Joe! ringing out. Mr Clyburn, the South Carolina congressman whose endorsement this week appeared to have an impact, took to the stage to introduce Mr Biden. This campaign this year is about the goodness of America and we have as our candidate a real good man, Mr Clyburn said. Attending were some of those who had propelled Mr Biden to his victory, such as Mildred Gooden, a 60-year-old African-American teacher who had driven 45 minutes to be there. He\u0027s going to get a quantum leap into Super Tuesday, Ms Gooden told The Daily  of Mr Biden\u0027s win, adding that she had been a backer of his for years.  I was very supportive of that Biden-Obama team. He needs to continue that legacy. I know he can and I know he will. Carlton Green, a 60 year-old from Columbia, said Mr Sanders\u0027s left-wing policies worked against him in South Carolina, a state that is solidly Republican in presidential elections. The socialist thing is a big thing here in South Carolina. We\u0027re a very conservative state, so I think that was the biggest factor, he said. An eventual winner will be crowned at the Democratic Party convention in July before taking on Donald Trump in November\u0027s presidential election. Mr Trump tweeted about the race as it became clear Mr Biden would win, calling him Sleepy Joe and taking aim at Mini Mike, his nickname for Mr Bloomberg. Sleepy Joe Biden’s victory in the South Carolina Democrat Primary should be the end of Mini Mike Bloomberg’s joke of a campaign, Mr Trump wrote. After the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates, Mini Mike now has Biden split up his very few voters, taking many away!More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 1st march 2020","story":"People watch a sculpture of a bridge burning at the Maslenitsa (Shrovetide) festival at the Nikola-Lenivets art park in Nikola-Lenivets village, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) south-west of Moscow,St David\u0026#39s Day 2020: Welsh traditions, medieval miracles and how leeks became an iconic symbolSuper Tuesday 2020: when is it, and why is it so important?Comment: Our toxic gender politics are making a mockery of women’s sport\t\u0026#39Police stood by\u0026#39 as Muslims pelted with rocks in Delhi riotsComment: We all need to change how we live our lives to fight this generation of pandemicsCoronavirus latest news: Staff member at Reading infant school tests positiveComment: The Mayor of London isn’t fooling anyone with his cynical grime grandstandingJoe Biden has the \u0026#39Big Mo\u0026#39 going into Super Tuesday: five things we learned from the South Carolina primaryJoe Biden wins big in South Carolina, bringing campaign back from the brinkMandarins accuse Sir Mark Sedwill of \u0026#39going native\u0026#39 as top civil servant quits in row with Priti PatelRetired doctors and nurses could help hospitals deal with coronavirus crisisVirtual key may let police spy on web messagesCoronavirus: Online shopping surges as supermarket shelves emptyCoronavirus news: US records first death as patient dies in Washington stateFalklands War memorial finds new home on St David\u0026#39s dayMuslim leaders should do more to equip young people to challenge terrorist recruiters, Government adviser on Islamophobia saysSir Philip Rutnam: The civil servant with \u0026#39a remarkable ability to rub Home Secretaries up the wrong way\u0026#39Keir Starmer dragged into bullying row by his own Labour members as allies accuse hard-Left of \u0026#39smear\u0026#39 campaignComment: Transparency will convince the world China is a friendBoris Johnson rejects EU demands to bind UK to European human rights lawsCoronavirus could become seasonal infection that returns each winter, experts warnWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/27/17/correction-0.jpg","title":"stock market correction coronavirus meaning definition sp 500 stoxx 600","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.What does a correction actually mean?

It may give rise to a further cycle of fearful selling.It could presage a 20 per cent decline in values, the definition of a “bear market”.More broadly, falling share prices matter in that many of us are invested in stock markets through our pension or other saving schemes.So when markets\u0026nbspfall, we are worse off.It’s estimated that more than $3 trillion of value has been lost from listed companies across the world this week.\u0026nbspHowever, providing we are not about to retire tomorrow we shareholders are only worse off on paper. Shares in the long term have tended to rise.Any other reason to be relaxed amid the market mayhem?Some analysts argue that major stock sell offs and corrections can be healthy if they bring an overheated market down to earth.“Stocks have moved upwards for many months without a significant correction — and there is a compelling argument to make that a correction is overdue,” says Kristina Hooper of Invesco.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is expected to be ejected from Earth’s orbit altogether in April,” said John Blakeslee, head of science at the international Gemini Observatory, which was responsible for the new images.In the picture, the object can be seen glowing at the centre, with stars streaking across because the telescope was moving to track the object as it moved around the Earth.The image was taken on 24 February, soon after\u0026nbsp2020\u0026nbspCD3 was first spotted.Astronomers hope to get more images of the object, in an attempt to learn more about it.They will look in particular to understand how bright it is shining and how much light it reflects – if it is especially dim, then it is likely to be a rocky body, but if it is shining brighter it is more likely to be a reflective piece of debris, such as a used rocket booster.“Additional observations to refine its position will help us determine this mystery object’s orbit and its possible origin,” he said.Astronomers expect to find many more such objects as new ways of observing them come online.The Gemini Observatory is part of the\u0026nbspNSF’s\u0026nbspNational Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory, which is currently preparing the\u0026nbspVera C\u0026nbspRubin Observatory, which will scan the sky of seeing yet more similar objects.“We expect to find a population of these objects once the Rubin Observatory is operational,” said Mr Fedorets\u0026nbspin a statement. “Stay tuned!”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A\u0026nbsplovespoon is a customary gift weighted with symbolismA tradition dating from the 17th century, a Welsh lovespoon is given by skilled carvers to the objects of their affection to demonstrate prowess in carpentry and\u0026nbspimply\u0026nbspan ability to provide.\u0026nbspLovespoons are commonly decorated with hearts, anchors, horseshoes, knots and locks, with many conveying hidden emotional meaning. A spoon with an entwined stem, for instance, indicates togetherness, while a decorative Welsh dragon at the tip of the handle represents a protective charm.Created with Sketch.

He is also recognised as the patron saint of doves.11 best Welsh drinks for St David’s DayMiracles associated with David include the Synod of Llanddewi Brefi\u0026nbsp- where he raised a hill up from the ground so that his followers could better hear a sermon – restoring sight to the blind St. Paulinus and bringing a dead boy back to life with his tears. David also survived a poisoning at the hands of his own monks, who had fed him tainted bread after growing tired of the hard labour and deprivation they had suffered as a result of his extreme brand of asceticism.He died on 1 March in 589 AD and his remains have been interred at St. David’s Cathedral in Pembrokeshire since he was canonised by Pope Callixtus in 1120 (or they were, until King Edward I made off with his head and arm as holy relics in 1284). David’s burial site has been a popular place of pilgrimage for centuries since and his\u0026nbspaphorism “Gwnewch y pethau bychain” -\u0026nbspor “do the little things” -\u0026nbspremains a national motto to this day.The people of Wales celebrate their national day by sporting daffodils about their person and taking part in festivities across the country, with large parades staged in Cardiff, Aberystwyth, Wrexham and Llandudno every year. Children are often dressed in traditional folk attire dating from the 18th and 19th centuries and the national hymn, “Land of our Fathers”, resounds.Traditional Welsh dishes are also served – notably roast lamb or Rarebit – with perhaps the least appetising being raw leeks, customarily presented to Welsh regiments of the British army to devour whole in a nod to their distinctive heritage.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has since been suggested that they may instead be formed by flowing sand NasaJPLUniversity of ArizonaMorning Aurora: Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly captured this photograph of the green lights of the aurora from the International Space Station in October 2015And we don\u0027t know why it\u0027s so big.But it happened very slowly –\u0026nbsplike an explosion in slow motion that took place over hundreds of millions of years.Scientists find mysterious origin of brightest explosion ever seenAstronomers used NASA\u0027s Chandra X-Ray Observatory to make the discovery, along with a European space observatory and ground telescopes. They believe the explosion came from the heart of the Ophiuchus cluster of thousands of galaxies: a large galaxy at the center contains a colossal black hole.Black holes don\u0027t just draw matter in. They also blast out jets of material and energy.The first hint of this giant explosion actually came in 2016. Chandra images of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster revealed an unusual curved edge, but scientists ruled out an eruption given the amount of energy that would have been needed to carve out such a large cavity in the gas.The two space observatories, along with radio data from telescopes in Australia and India, confirmed that the curvature was, indeed, part of a cavity.The radio data fit inside the X-rays like a hand in a glove, co-author Maxim Markevitch of NASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said in a statement. This is the clincher that tells us an eruption of unprecedented size occurred here.The blast is believed to be over by now: There are no signs of jets currently shooting from the black hole.More observations are needed in other wavelengths to better understand what occurred, according to the team.The findings appeared in the Astrophysical Journal.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Tom Steyer, who had staked most of his chances on a solid showing in the state, was the only other candidate to break double-digits in the state, and dropped out after his third-place finish.

This year, 14 states will vote on Super Tuesday, including the nation’s most populous states, California and Texas.\u0026nbspOf crucial importance, we will see the impact of former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg’s non-traditional, self-funded run, that has seen him invest up to $400m to win support in many of the states voting on Super Tuesday.In order to win any delegates (a candidate needs to amass 1,991 delegates to achieve the party’s nomination) candidates have to win at least 15 percent of the vote in the state.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThere are enough delegates at stake that a strong showing for senator Bernie Sanders could cement his spot as Democratic nominee. At the same time, should he fail to overcome his top rivals, the race could become a serious competition between two or potentially even three candidates.\u0026nbspHere’s a state-by-state breakdown to keep you informed heading into Super Tuesday.\u0026nbspAll demographic numbers are from the Centre for American Progress’ “States of Change” report.\u0026nbspThe Yellowhammer state has 61 total delegates – including 9 superdelegates – up for grabs on Super Tuesday.\u0026nbspDemographically, Alabama is one of six states – along with the District of Columbia – where black Democratic voters are the majority. Democratic voter composition in Alabama in 2016 was 71 per cent black, 26 per cent white and three per cent other races.\u0026nbspAccording to 2016 Census data, Alabama has a slightly higher than average population of iniduals 65 years of age and older – almost 20 per cent versus the 19 percent average. The state’s median household income is more than $10,000 less than the national average, $42,830 versus $53,657 nationally. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFiveThirtyEight predicts former Vice President Joe Biden will take the state, giving him a 61 percent chance at victory in the state. Mr Sanders is the next most likely to take the state with a 21 percent chance of victory, and Mr\u0026nbspBloomberg is in third with a 17 percent chance of victory.There are 31 pledged delegates available to win in Arkansas including five superdelegates. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDemographically, Arkansas’ Democratic voters are 69 per cent white, 36 per cent black, three per cent Hiic and two per cent other races.According to 2016 Census data, the state has a slightly higher than average population of iniduals over the age of 65 – 21 per cent versus the national average of 19 per cent – and a median household income of $41,262 more than $10,000 less than the national average of $53,657.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He was given a 38 per cent chance to win the state. Mr Bloomberg is the next most likely to win, with a 28 per cent chance of victory. Mr Biden has a 25 per cent chance to win. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe most recent poll examining the Arkansas electorate from Talk Business \u0026amp PoliticsHendrix College Poll reported that Mr Bloomberg had a 3.2 percent lead over Mr Sanders in the state.\u0026nbspJust under 20 per cent of respondents said they’d vote for Mr Bloomberg, while 16.4 per cent said they’d vote for Mr Sanders and 18.5 per cent said they’d vote for Mr Biden.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThis is a massive prize.

The state’s median household income is $61,933, which is $2,276 higher than the national average. Despite this, the state’s poverty rate, 14.5 per cent, is slightly higher than the national average of 13.6 per cent.\u0026nbspMr Sanders is overwhelmingly favoured in polling to win California. FiveThirtyEight gives Mr Sanders an 89 per cent chance to win, with poll averages predicting Mr Sanders will win between 24 per cent and 43 per cent of the vote and win an average of the state’s 227 pledged delegates. Every other candidate is at risk of falling under the 15 per cent viability threshold. The closest runner up, Mr Biden, is only expected to win an average of 17 percent of the vote and an average of 83 delegates. Mr Sanders and Mr Biden are the only candidates whose predicted averages exceed the 15 percent viability threshold.\u0026nbspThe Centennial State has 67 pledged delegates on the line and nine superdelegates.Colorado’s Democratic voters are 75 per cent white, 15 per cent Hiic, six per cent black, and four per cent Asian and other races.Census data from 2016 shows that the state has a population of iniduals 65-year-old and over that is 2.4 percent lower than the national average of 18.9 per cent.

Ms Warren – who is the state’s senator – has a 25 per cent chance to win. The next closest candidate is Mr Biden with an eight per cent chance of victory. Mr Sanders is predicted to win an average of 35 delegates from the state.\u0026nbspMinnesota – Senator Amy Klobuchar’s home state – has 75 pledged delegates, including 10 superdelegates.

Mr Biden is the next most likely to win, with a predicted 36 percent chance of victory. After that, Mr Bloomberg has a 19 percent chance to win and Ms Warren is given a two percent chance.\u0026nbspThe state’s Democratic voter demographics is 66 per cent white, 20 percent black, nine per cent Asian and American Indian, and five per cent Hiic.FiveThirtyEight predicts a close race in Oklahoma. Mr Sanders leads the pack with a 35 percent chance to win.

The next closest candidate is Mr Bloomberg with 17 percent, and Ms Warren at three percent.As the second most populous state in the US, Texas has 228 pledged delegates, including 30 superdelegates.\u0026nbsp It is also the second most sought-after state in terms of electoral college votes.

Since October 2016, GOP registration has dropped by half a percentage point. Democrats have actually declined by nearly a full point over the same . Independents have benefited from both drops.And they have been doing so for years. Democrats are more than three points off their peak this century, which was in 2008 when Barack Obama was about to become president. At the time, 43.62 per cent of voters were registered Democrats.Republicans are also more than three points off where they were four years earlier, in 2004, when 32.79 per cent of voters were Republicans and George W Bush won re-election.Since 2008, the trendline for each party has been relatively steady. But while Democratic registrations fell more between 2016 and 2018 (0.78 per cent) than Republicans (0.15 per cent), Republicans have fallen more since 2018. Since Democrats won back the House of Representatives in that midterm, their registration numbers have declined by just 0.16 per cent, compared to 0.37 percent for Republicans.Bernie Sanders polling higher than Elizabeth Warren in her own stateThese numbers, it bears emphasising, aren’t the full picture and differ from surveys of party registration. While national pollsters like Gallup ask samples of Americans to self-identify which party they align with, these numbers represent actual party registrations, and they only account for the 31 states that actually have party registration. When you ask people in all 50 states to self-identify, Independents do significantly better, and Democrats do significantly worse the most recent Gallup data show 42 percent of people identify as Independents, and more identify as Republican than Democrat, 30 percent to 27 percent.Indeed, part of the reason we still have many more actual registered Democrats is that some Southern and Appalachian states still feature more registered Democrats than Republicans, even though those states have been voting reliably Republican at nearly every level of government for years and years. Louisiana, for example, has more than 300,000 more registered Democrats (1,216,000) than registered Republicans (905,000). Blue states are also more likely to have party registration than red states.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ministers need officials to deliver a thousand and one things.“And on top of the Brexit tasks there is also the day job of counter terrorism, organized crime, policing and drugs.”But Ms Patel’s allies last night retaliated to dub Sir Philip “a classic, old school establishment mandarin” who is overly cautious.One said: “He is very good at blocking things without saying it. It is never a flat out ‘no’, just lots of ‘ooh minister, that’s very courageous’”.One recent victory attributed to Sir Philip was to signicantly simply the new points-based immigration system, stripping it down from an original more complex plan.It can then be built on over time, once it is up and running and offering visas to businesses in the Autumn.One senior Home Office insider dubbed it “a big clash of cultures, a risk manager versus a radical reformer”.As well as the Home Office, the Departments for Transport and the Environment as well as HM Revenue and Customs are also under heavy strain.“Cracks will appear” in them too soon, it is predicted.Insiders say Government lawyers are under the most pressure of all because of the need to draft so much new legislation and treaty agreements, both with the EU and other countries.The Home Office last night refused to deny Sir Philip has issued warnings.Instead, a Home Office spokesman said: “The Home Secretary and Permanent Secretary are deeply concerned about the number of  allegations appearing in the media.“They are focused on delivering on the Home Office’s hugely important agenda, which includes creating an immigration system that works for the UK, putting more police on the streets and keeping the public safe from terrorism.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Am I mad  Actually, I think I’m pretty sane, although I may be biased.I’ll explain my reasoning.My abstinence from clothes shopping is no big secret. I’ve mentioned it many times before but I guess in these times of impending climate doom it’s trendier now. The irony, not buying clothes is in fashion.It’s a bit like feminism.That used to be “those bra-burning crazy women”  but now it’s OK. Cool, in fact. Probably because we live in a much more “woke” society.It must be my Blue Peter upbringing. After all, I’m always saying Blue Peter was woke before woke was a thing — the appeals, growing produce in the greenhouse, making things, inclusivity, ersity. It was ahead of the game!Often we overcomplicate matters, overlooking the easy option. Take not buying more clothes, for example. It has so many advantages . . .❶ Keeping your old clothes is a good incentive to stick to the same weight. I pretty much stopped growing by age  so everything I’ve owned since then still fits. Plus I don’t really wear tight clothes either, so fluctuating by a few pounds here and there is OK.❷ I’m pretty lazy and the thought of having to go shopping for clothes feels like a big effort. Even buying online is hard work.What to buy  Will it fit  How do Iit  What a hassle. When I was younger, I liked to shop with friends. But that novelty wore off long ago.Now, as a mum, when I see friends all I want is to have good conversations.❸ Not being fashionable is liberating. You don’t have to hang out with people who judge you on what you wear. You can hang out with people that like you for you. When people glance me up and down to check out my rags, I have a secret sense of satisfaction that I no longer worry what they’re thinking.❹ It’s way cheaper to not buy stuff. Think of all the money you’ll save.❺ I won’t bang on about it but clothes, consumer goods and stuff in general in our society are becoming too dis­pos­able and our Earth can’t cope. We are having to get rid of all of it in landfill and it’s just not sustainable. It’s killing the planet.So it’s a no-brainer.The other day I was with a couple of like-minded friends and one commented on the other’s top.The other replied:  “It’s five years old from HM.” The first laughed, then said: “Mine’s seven years old from Florence And Fred, so there.”Maybe one day we will live in a world where people will judge on how OLD clothes are, rather than how new.So we’ll get to the point where something being “so last year” is a compliment.WHITNEY HOUSTON ed to our shores on Tuesday, hitting the stage in Sheffield in the opening leg of her  UK tour.When I say “”, she hasn’t come back from the afterle but is performing in the form of a hologram.

This  along with many other claims   is completely .”He added: “The Home Secretary categorically denied any involvement in this campaign to the Cabinet Office. I regret I do not believe her. She has not made the efforts I would expect to dissociate herself from the comments.”Sir Philip claimed he was asked by Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill to “effect a reconciliation” with Ms Patel.He added: “Despite my efforts to engage with her, Priti Patel has  made no effort to engage with me.”I take this decision with great regret after a career of  years.I am making this statement now because I will be issuing a claim against the Home Office for constructive dismissal.In the last ten days, I have been the target of a vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign.It has been alleged that I have briefed the media against the Home Secretary.This - along with many other claims - is completely .The Home Secretary categorically denied any involvement in this campaign to the Cabinet Office.I regret I do not believe her.She has not made the efforts I would expect to dissociate herself from the comments.Even despite this campaign I was willing to effect a reconciliation with the Home Secretary, as requested by the Cabinet Secretary on behalf of the Prime Minister.But despite my efforts to engage with her, Priti Patel has made no effort to engage with me to discuss this.I believe that these events give me very strong grounds to claim constructive, unfair dismissal - and I will be pursuing that claim in the courts.My experience has been extreme but I consider that there is evidence that it is part of a wider pattern of behaviour.One of my duties as permanent secretary was to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of our , people.This created tension with the Home Secretary, and I have encouraged her to change her behaviours.I have received allegations that her conduct has included shouting and swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands - behaviour that created fear and that needed some bravery to call out.I know that resigning in this way will have very serious implications for me personally. The Cabinet Office offered me a financial settlement that would have avoided this outcome.I am aware that there will continue to be briefing against me now I have made this decision, but I am hopeful that at least it may not now be directed to my colleagues or the department.This has been a very dficult decision but I hope that my stand may help in maintaining the quality of government in our country, which includes hundreds of thousands of civil servants loyally dedicated to delivering this governments agenda.I will make no further comment at this stage.Sir Philip, whose career spans  years, revealed he was offered a “financial ­settlement” by the Cabinet Office but rejected it in order to resign publicly and “call out” Ms Patel’s conduct.He said he  “received allegations” Ms Patel’s conduct had included “shouting and swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands, behaviour that created fear and needed some bravery to call out”. Ms Patel’s allies last week called claims she was cutting Sir Philip out of meetings “total b******s”. They said he failed to turn up to a  security meeting with her last week adding: “He’s cut himself out.”In a joint statement last week, Ms Patel and Sir Philip said they were  “deeply concerned” by “ allegations” that the Home Secretary is distrusted by intelligence chiefs and bullied staff.Sir Philip — appointed in  — was due to continue in the role until the completion of a standard five-year tenure in April . His deputy  Shona Dunn will become acting permanent secretary.Labour leadership hopeful Lisa Nandy said: “It’s time for the Government to come clean on the scale of bullying by ministers and advisers.”IS Britain governed by elected ministers or holier-than-thou civil servants Bolshy mandarins like Sir Philip ­Rutnam too often believe they are really running the country.His decision to quit and go to war on former boss Priti Patel revealed the type of breathtaking arrogance which triggered this showdown in the first place.As the highest ranked civil servant in the Home Office Sir Philip should be a model of probity, diplomacy and restraint.Yet his unprecedented public outpouring of vitriol would have seemed extreme from the victim of a two-footed tackle in the Manchester derby.Sir Philip had reportedly resisted the Home Secretary’s challenging timetable for post-Brexit reforms. This even earned comparisons with former Chancellor Phil “Spreadsheet” Hammond, another stick-in-the-mud Eeyore. But though senior civil servants should advise ministers discreetly, ultimately they must do their bidding.The Government won its large majority on a manesto of change. It cannot be ruled by Sir Humphreys, employing every trick in the book to delay and frustrate those elected to enact the will of the people.Sir Philip is a £,-a-year knighted bureaucrat who will no doubt end up with a gold-plated pension far beyond the dreams of ordinary workers.Instead of bleating he should face the reality of the situation.If he can’t or won’t do the job, the Government has to get someone who can.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As we edge closer to a full-blown pandemic, a little perspective will go a long way.As those Brit tourists locked inside the Costa Adeje Palace in Tenere would probably tell you, the greatest threat posed by the virus is massive inconvenience, not sudden death.If you are not old, and have no pre- existing medical conditions, then coronavirus is slightly more le-threatening than regular flu — which killed , Brits last year.Every doctor will tell you that hands are a route of transmission — so keep them clean, and take a rain-check on handshakes, manly hugs and social kissing.Professor Hugh Pennington, a ­lecturer in diseases at Aberdeen University, says, “Just using ordinary soap and water is all that’s needed.It can make all the dference and really limit the spread of this virus.”We should be thinking about ­better personal hygiene rather than panic buying.I am not making the case for complacency. The world is facing the greatest health crisis for a ­generation.This week the first cases were seen in countries as far apart as Pakistan, Greece, Brazil, Nigeria and Wales.The cancelled sporting events are piling up. Schools are closing. The stock market is in freefall. This is not normal le.Personally, I am not getting on a plane until my daughter is the far side of her exams in the spring.My local gym has installed hand sanitisers and I use them.When I see someone coughing, I wish they had the common decency to cover their cakehole.But every one of us must walk the hard path between staying safe and staying sane.The Government’s worst-case scenario predicts half-a-million British deaths from the virus — which would exceed the number of British military and civilian deaths in World War Two.Is Covid- REALLY deadlier than living through — and fighting in — World War Two The Government should ditch the scare stories and tell us how to stay healthy. They should keep repeating how simple personal hygiene habits can contain the spread of Covid-.Keep calm, carry on and wash your hands.For as any doctor will tell you, there is nothing more contagious than panic.ANA De Armas is doing the heavy lting in promoting the new Bond film, No Time To Die.In the last week alone, Ana has appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair and Porter magazines. What’s lovely about the Cuban goddess is that she actually seems happy to be in a James Bond movie.“I was jumping all over the place and very excited,” she says about getting her role as CIA agent Paloma.In stark contrast, it is hard to imagine grumpy old Daniel Craig jumping with excitement at anything to do with the Bond franchise.“I don’t even call them Bond girls,” grumbles downbeat Dan.It’s like having Victor Meldew playing .DAVID Dimbleby, the nearest thing the BBC has to royalty, claims that: “The whole idea of a national broadcaster that speaks truth to the nation and is impartial and objective is under threat.”But whose fault is that Millions of us blame the BBC. Because during the great national debate about Brexit, the BBC was openly, unapologetically biased.The orthodoxy of BBC opinion is totally out of touch with the people who fork out the £billion a year for the licence fee.For years the BBC told those people that they are thick, ignorant racists who would all soon be dead.If the BBC had been “impartial and objective” in recent years, it would not be ripe for losing the licence fee.Prince Harry and the Queen have always seemed close.And in a family that is not big on displays of affection, the Queen’s face always seemed to light up in her grandson’s cheeky, ginger-bonce presence.But his North American exile means Harry will now see far less of his grandmother,  this April.If Harry has an IQ bigger than Meghan’s shoe size, I bet he will live to regret it.STORM Dennis, Storm Ciara and now Storm Jorge.For three weeks in a row, rain and floods have brought abject misery across the country from the north of England to Wales – the same areas that gave Boris Johnson his -seat majority.Homes have been ruined.

It’s spreading uncontrollably and we are losing our grip.”The Department of Health admitted it was “highly likely” Britain would “see some instances of community transmission”  — opening up the prospect of more similar home-grown casesThe patient has been moved to a specialist infection centre at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital in London.Haslemere Health Centre, which the man had attended, was closed briefly. Officials are urgently “contact tracing” to piece together the chain of transmission.The nearby Prince of Wales pub was also forced to lock its doors.The landlords put up a sign saying: “Unfortunately a customer who visited us has tested positive for coronavirus so as a precautionary measure we are closing for a full deep clean.”But the staff have not been told who the coronavirus victim is.A source said: “It’s doctor-patient confidentiality. All they will say is ‘patient X has been at your pub’. It’s shocking.”The doctor who has fallen ill could have seen scores of patients before showing symptoms.

This means it can easily go under the radar.”Panicked Haslemere residents demanded to know the man’s name.Gran Maureen Wisdom, , said: “The worry is he didn’t go abroad.

Like millions of other couples, they have lived together for a while, and now they are having a baby and getting married.Even the way they got that dog, Dilyn the Jack Russell rescue puppy, is reminiscent of other ­couples who get a pet because they have not yet got a baby.Boris is by nature an optimist. He presses ahead where more cautious career politicians would hang back, worried the whole thing would upset too many voters, especially those of an old-fashioned disposition.But Boris has horried them already, by becoming the first Prime Minister ever to live with his girlfriend in Downing Street.Old-fashioned voters ought to be delighted that he is now getting married to Carrie.He has always loved having children, the more the better as far as he is concerned.And he loves being married. This may seem a curious thing to write of a man who will have twice been orced, once the formalities to end his present marriage have been completed.But Boris is not one of those men who regards commitment with terror. With boundless optimism, he dismisses the doubts that might have held him back.His first marriage, to Allegra Mostyn-Owen, whom he met at Oxford University, was not a success. She had appeared on the cover of Tatler, was famous for her beauty and was a sympathetic and sensitive person.But she could not bear being married to such a driven man, who worked with titanic energy to make a success of his chosen career of journalism.She and Boris were completely incompatible, and very soon the marriage broke down.His second marriage, to Marina Wheeler, was in many ways a great success, and lasted for a quarter of a century. They had four children, and were clearly very much in love.From time to time Marina threw him out of the house for having affairs, but she did not generally hurl him into outer darkness.He would instead find himself staying, during these periods of banishment, with mutual friends.But one cannot imagine Marina, a successful lawyer with socialist convictions, would ever have been happy living at No as the we of a Conservative Prime Minister.Carrie will embrace that role. She has worked for the Conservative Party, understands how it works and sympathises with its aims.Ministers for whom she has worked pay tribute to her acumen.Only two PMs before Boris have ever got orced: the Duke of Grafton in the eighteenth century, and Sir Anthony Eden, who succeeded Churchill in .As so often, Boris is breaking new ground, determined to do things his own way, unwilling to observe conventions for which he can see no point.In the theatre of politics, he puts on a performance unlike anyone ’s, and of which not everyone can approve, but which everyone finds themselves talking about. He got into the Commons in  but was soon criticised for ious gross failures of responsibility.When he was found to have lied to the Press about his affair with Petronella Wyatt — he dismissed the story as “an inverted pyramid of pfle”, when actually it was entirely true — he was sacked by the then Conservative leader Michael Howard from the front-bench team.This meant that in  Johnson was in no position to run for the leadership, and had to watch fellow Etonian David Cameron take over. A less resilient character would have abandoned politics for a well-paid career in newspapers and television. Johnson went off and became Mayor of London.He reached the top on his own terms, and now he is doing something wonderfully conventional he is getting married.

This even earned comparisons with former Chancellor Phil “Spreadsheet” Hammond, another stick-in-the-mud Eeyore. But though senior civil servants should advise ministers discreetly, ultimately they must do their bidding.The Government won its large majority on a manesto of change.

Jim Clyburn, of South Carolina — a move that was a major factor for local voters.An exit poll by Edison Research found the backing from Clyburn was important for six out of  primary voters.There was also evidence that Biden’s status as Obama’s two-term vice president helped him win over African Americans.South Carolina was the first big test to see the candidates appeal among African American voters.It gave Biden the win he needed, but he still has to prove that he has the resources to expand his campaign ahead of Super Tuesday.Before Biden was declared victorious, Bloomberg announced a place to deliver a three-minute address during primetime on Sunday night on two TV networks.He didnt say how much he paid for the air time — which is unprecedented in recent decades.Sanders was already looking ahead to Super Tuesday, betting he can amass an insurmountable delegate lead at that point.After two victories in a row and a tie for the lead in Iowa, the -year-old Vermont senators confidence is surging.Sanders was spending the lead-up to Super Tuesday campaigning in the home states of two major Democratic rivals, betting he can score a double knockout blow — or at least limit the size of their victories.Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Sanders, said s Super Tuesday taught them that any candidate who finishes the day with a delegate advantage will be hard to beat.“I’m confident we’re going to do very, very well across the country, Weaver said of the coming four days. He also tried to downplay the importance of South Carolina, where “Biden is expected to win.”Saturdays election in South Carolina marks the first statewide test of its new fleet of electronic voting machines.The machines were part of a  million upgrade from an old and vulnerable system that lacked any paper record of inidual votes.The new machines produce a paper record that can be veried by the voter and checked after the election to detect any mal or manipulation.Do you have a story for The U.S. Sun team Email us at exclusive@the-sun or call --.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Labour leadership contender quotes the assassinated US president word for word: “We choose to go to the Moon and do other things not because they are easy but because they are hard.” And that is how the Wigan MP sees the challenge of leading the Labour Party – a hard job, not an easy one. The very existence of Labour is now under threat and in her words it must “change or die”. She adds: “We have to win the argument and we haven’t been making the argument. By the time of last year’s General Election no one was listening. “We’d had four years of factional infighting and cared more about talking to ourselves. So when Labour made promises people just stopped listening. We have to rebuild trust in the Party. We can do that but it will be hard.”  Lisa backs taking railways back into public ownership, and decentralising – as opposed to nationalising – energy firms so communities are in control. She is also keen to take decision-making out of Londoners’ hands and spread it wider. Her plan for the future of the BBC is to give licence fee payers a direct say on who runs the Corporation by electing directors to the board.  She adds: “The people who determine what is made and when it’s aired sit behind a desk in London. It’s not a national conversation.” On social media she says: “There’s a particular problem for women MPs in constituencies where there’s been huge economic decline.

In an unprecedented outburst Home Office Permanent Secretary Sir Philip Rutnam said he would sue the Government for constructive dismissal. And he accused Ms Patel of ­a “vicious and ­orchestrated campaign” driving him out. Sir Philip said Ms Patel told the Cabinet Office she was not involved in ­briefing against him. He added: “I regret I don’t believe her.” He claimed that speaking out would mean losing the ­generous payoff offered by the Cabinet Office to buy his silence. Sir Philip, a loyal civil servant for  years, was probing claims that Ms Patel ­shouted, swore at and “belittled” staff. A well-placed Whitehall source said: “Priti must be toast now. What Philip says to an employment tribunal will be ­dynamite.” Ex-immigration minister Caroline Nokes, who worked closely with Sir Philip, said: “Philip is diligent and hard-working. “He’ll be a great loss to the Home Office.” Commons Home Affairs Committee member Stephen Doughty said: “Priti Patel’s position must now be in ­question. She’s already had to resign from the Cabinet once.“This is clear evidence of a dysal Government driven by a ­toxic culture at the very top.” Labour ’s Jon Trickett demanded Boris Johnson makes an urgent statement to Parliament to answer Sir Philip’s ­allegations.Labour leadership front-runner Sir Keir Starmer said: “It is ­unprecedented for a senior civil servant to raise ­concerns in such a public way.  “Effective government demands that those who dedicate themselves to public service can do so in an environment free of bullying and harassment.”Lib Dem Home Affairs ­spokeswoman Christine Jardine said: “The Tories are ­acting like Donald Trump . The way these Conservatives are treating public servants is ­outrageous.”Days ago Sir Philip ­released a joint statement with Ms Patel saying she was not a bully.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailLabouraposs membership should be given more power to stop the partyaposs MPs selling out, deputy leadership candidate Richard Burgon has declared. Calling for a Bernie Sanders-style grassroots revolution in the way the party fights elections, Mr Burgon tells the Mirror thatthe party had listened to its members it could even be in government now.The Shadow Justice Secretary shot to prominence as an unwavering defender of Jeremy Corbyn and the left-wing politics which propelled him to power inside the Labour party.The party is still licking its wounds after its heaviest defeat since the s, and a long contest to replace Mr Corbyn, and ex-deputy leader Tom Watson, has seen all but the most loyal question the apospeople power politicsapos which put Labouraposs left in control of the party - but didnapost put them in power. Mr Burgon believes that this brand of Bennite politics will eventually win the day -the party has the appetite to face the heat it generates from a powerful establishment. Many of Mr Burgonaposs former comrades on the barricades seem to have lost their appetite for a strand of Labour politics that puts the partyaposs members, and affiliated trade-unions, firmly in the driving seat. But the Leeds East MP is unrepentant and believes it wasnapost the party left-wing policies that kept them from power. Sat in his Westminster office, beneath photographs of former NUM leader Arthur Scargill being arrested and Labour founder Keir Hardie, the Shadow Justice Secretary firmly rejects the idea that it was the partyaposs left politics that lost them the last election. Brexit overshadowed traditional party loyalties, he says.Mr Corbyn was a man targeted by the right-wing press because of his socialist politics. The answer isnapost to change course, he argues the heavy fire is evidence that the party is in the right place and the establishment is unsettled. Polls put him in second place in the five-way race, behind frontrunner Angela Rayner. Speaking to the Mirror, Mr Burgon defended giving Labour members, who critics say are far more left-wing than the general public, an even greater say over the partyaposs future direction. His manesto for reforming the party, the deputy leader has traditionally looked after internal issues within the party, is a radical one. It would introduce Open Selections, making MPs compete to keep their right to stand for the party in an open contest at every election, reforming the partyaposs constitution to enshrine its socialist values and even giving members a vote onthe party should support decisions on war and peace. A Tony Benn School for Political education would teach activists the ABCs of Labour politics. A hint of which brand of Labour politics becomes clearer when Mr Burgon picks left-wing academic Ralph Miliband - father ofEd andDavid Miliband - as his favourite member of the family.  Oh it has to be Ralph, he laughs, although I do like Ed a lot. MPs, he says, need to realise the limits of their judgment - and the risks that being in Parliament could see them lose their values. Mr Burgon says: I think people have got to understand, and Aneurin Bevan talked about this, that Parliament basically is a system designed to make people sell out without realising. It is a system designed to make people lose touch without realising it. So most people donapost wake up as a Labour MP, on the left or the right, and say, you know what todayaposs the day Iaposm going to sell out and forget my roots. The system embraces them, the system seduces them. This he warns leaves them at risk of becoming out of touch and leads them occasionally losing the plot. He added: A good example is the ridiculous attempts to get rid of Jeremy in .  It was outrageous, but looking back at it now people can more clearly see: the Conservatives were in crisis, David Cameron was on the way out because of the way heaposd handled the EU referendum.But Labour MPs thought the priority should be to turn that into the crisis of the Labour Party, and thataposs why we lost the  general election .If we had listened to members at the time, weaposd have got it right. If weaposd listened to the members over the war in Iraq, weaposd have got it right and wouldnapost have gone into the war. The same with PFI. Obviously the Parliamentary Labour Party is vital, I respect the role my colleagues play. I think we all play an important role but weaposre part of a movement, weaposre not the movement on our own. There are so many issues where Labour members across the country got it right and MPs would do well to listen to them. It would be for their benefit. Mr Burgon goes on to say that when it comes to future Labour manestos he would give members the final say on what the partyaposs policy will be.  Historically, Labouraposs conference has selected policy which has informed, although not necessarily closely, the ideas which go on to make up Labouraposs offer to the electorate. Instead, the Shadow Cabinet and Labouraposs ruling National Executive Committee have hammered out an agreement - often making conference resolutions less left-wing than those backed by the membership. Even under Mr Corbyn, the party manesto weakened conference demands around abolishing private schools and closing immigration detention centres when putting its offer to the public. But the Shadow Justice Secretary in unambiguous about who he believes should decide policy. If something is passed at Labour party conference to be in the manesto, that should end up in the manesto. It has to be phrased in a way for public consumption thataposs, you know, almost like in tabloid language, but the substance of the policies should end up in the manesto. It is a big break from the way Labour decided upon its policy when it was last in government.Under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, a streamlined process gave members a voice, but the final decisions were ultimately made by politicians.Asked about Mr Blair, who has been critical of the partyaposs leftward drt, Mr Burgon said the ex-PM should really get a grip.

She is a symptom of what is wrong with this government. It’s unheard of for a Whitehall mandarin as senior as Sir Philip Rutnam to quit as dramatically as he did yesterday. And to publicly accuse the Home Secretary of being a bully and a liar is unprecedented. Sir Philip was one of Whitehall’s Sir Humphreys who obey a strict code of omerta. They may pull the strings behind the scenes but they never – but never – speak out publicly. For him to be driven to do so, and give up a handsome payoff to boot, shows there is something rotten at the core of government. And the worst of the bad apples are in Downing Street – Boris Johnson and his sinister sidekick Dominic Cummings. Their goal is to turn a healthy Parliamentary majority into a toxic tyranny. And they will destroy anyone who stands in their way. A ministerial adviser is marched from No to the dole queue by armed men. A chancellor is told he can keep his job but onlyhe sacks his staff. The PM and Cummings put the BBC in Coventry, but will not go to Coventry or other cities when they flood. And they behaved asbedridden when coronavirus first emerged. Only now are they awake to the threat.  Mr Johnson demands to be treated not as first among equals but as Dear Supreme Leader, a dictator firing off commands from deep within his No bunker. And a blind eye is often turned when ministers bully and harass their hardworking staff who do their best to look after us. Sir Philip’s actions yesterday will most likely end in Ms Patel also losing her job. But sadly there is a way to go before Boris Johnson loses his. Priti Patel has got something right though. And that is to equip , more police officers with Tasers.

I’m standing in the Cairngorms National Park, where two million visitors a year enjoy skiing, hiking among the snow-capped peaks and, until now, husky rides from Alan Stewart’s Cairngorm Sleddog centre. But in April,  years after he and we Fiona opened up near Aviemore, the centre will close its doors for ever because it just doesn’t snow enough. Alan, , tells me: “Climate change has finished us off.” His centre is the first business to shut in the area due to global warming. The writing was on the wall in  when Alan’s pack of  Siberian huskies began moulting in winter as warm weather confused their normal cycles. And this year, instead of snow, Alan says: “We just have mud.” Alan, who has welcomed Sir David Attenborough and Bear Grylls to his centre, goes on: “Weaposve got ospreys nesting close to us and I’ve seen them affected by the rain. “I’ve seen flies in the middle of winter because the place is so warm. Craziest thing of all is Iaposve got huskies moulting in the middle of winter – that tells you what nature is saying to them, to us. “To train dogs professionally you need several months of snow but even in Europe you cannot get enough snow.” The park, in the eastern Highlands of Scotland, has seen declining wildle, putting endangered species at risk, because of the lack of snow cover. The Cairngorm Mountains, covering  square miles, are losing snow cover at an alarming rate. Once encrusted in ice and snow for most of the year, a third of it has disappeared over the past  years. It could be snow free by temperatures continue to rise.  A report by the Cairngorms National Park Authority says experts estimate there “is likely to be a substantial decline in the number of days of snow cover” by . It also warns of flooding and a loss in bioersity. I visited the UK’s last wilderness, the set for BBC’s Winterwatch, to discover the impact of ever-warmer winters. Mountain tops have just a smattering of snow and conditions are more like spring. The white pistes at Cairngorm Mountain ski resort, near Aviemore, are turning to barren slopes. To counter that, resort chiefs invested in a snow maker which spewed out almost  tonnes of articial powder every day for more than a month before the season opened.  Snow and ice are also of great signicance to the wildle here. These mountains are home to  per cent of Britain’s endangered species, like rock ptarmigans – a white game bird and relic from the last ice age –  pairs of golden eagles and  pairs of ospreys. But this delicate inter-action of wildle and plants is beginning to buckle. The ptarmigan and mountain hare, both native species which change colour to blend in with the snow, are pushed further up the mountains to avoid being picked off by predators. Another victim is the mysterious sparrow-sized snow bunting.  While thousands overwinter all around the UK from the Arctic, only  pairs are believed to now breed near the tops of the highest mountains in Scotland, making their nests at the edge of patches of snow to eat frozen larvae. Conservationists want to protect the capercaillie – largest member of the game family and one of Scotland’s treasured birds. Breeding has been hit hard by increasingly wet and erratic weather in spring and early summer. Despite spending a morning dedicated to trying to spot one under the watchful eye of wildle guide Duncan McDonald, we fail to find one.  Perhaps not surprising as numbers have dropped to just over , from around , in the s. Speyside Wildle is one of several operators which rely on tourists lured by the rich wildle and the area’s whisky distilleries. But even these have been hit – a heatwave in  halted production as water ran dry. There are also fears for another iconic Scottish species – the Atlantic salmon. Once abundant,  saw a low of , caught across the country. On the banks of Loch Morlich, Will Boyd-Wallis, head of land management at CNPA, explains: “This is an important habitat for the Atlantic salmon. It’s a breeding space for them. If the water gets too hot then these eggs are not going to be viable and the salmon are not able to breed. It’s important we keep that water cool.  “One way this occurs is through the melting of the snow, which can last until June. With less snow, this is going to have a big impact.” Ski workers literally see the effects of climate change up close.  Jim Coorfoot, who has worked at Cairngorm Mountain ski centre for  years, said: “Stormy weather is stripping away the snow. Last year was one of the worst on record. “Normally there is a reliable source of snow at the top of the mountain but we have had to switch that to the bottom with the use of a machine. “I worry it will accelerate quicker than we can mitigate against. Typically at this time of year the slopes would be covered but the weather now is just so unpredictable.” Temperatures up here this decade have been almost a degree warmer and five per cent sunnier than average.  Lee Schofield, of Highlands and Islands Weather, offers free forecasts to tourists. He cited temperatures in Carrbridge – . degrees higher last month than in January . The rise mirrors staggering reports from Antarctica, where a record high of .C was recorded this month.

They flew back to London Stansted on Thursday night wearing surgical masks as a preventative measure. The drama comes as the hunt was stepped up for Patient Zero – the spreader who infected the first Brit tested positive for the Covid- virus without leaving the country. The first victim was treated at Haslemere Health Centre, Surrey, before going to Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospital in London. Chief Medical Officer for England Prof Chris Whitty said it was unclear whether the man had contracted the virus from someone recently back from abroad.  He said: “This is being investigated and contact tracing has begun.” Meanwhile, the Foreign Office confirmed a man, believed to be in his s, was the first Brit to die of the virus. He did not live in the UK but had been on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Three more Brits have tested positive after ing from abroad, bringing the total known cases here to  with a further , tested. The trio are from Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire and Berkshire. Meanwhile, the husband of British mum Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe jailed in Iran revealed she had caught the virus in prison.  The infection has reportedly swept through the Tehran jail where Nazanin, , is serving five years for ‘plotting to topple the government’.  In Liverpool, the Radisson Blu hotel has set up isolation rooms after a guest staying there after a trip to Thailand fell ill.  He had been mixing with other guests. US officials last night confirmed the country’s first coronavirus death hours after a student near Seattle tested positive. America has  cases so far. Back in Britain, the Government is set to bring in new emergency powers to try to stop the virus spreading after  cases were reported in just three days. Schools, councils and other parts of the public sector will be able to suspend laws – including health and safety measures – to cope with a pandemic.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailMob target Emilio Di Giovine knew it was an offer he couldn’t refuse... a rare reunion with his daughter, the Mafia Princess. The former crime boss left an Italian hideaway to join celebrations – in Lancashire, of all places – for Marisa Merico’s th birthday. It was a milestone both father and daughter never expected to see. For Marisa recalls loved ones being killed as she grew up – before taking over the Mafia reins herself when her dad was in jail for two murders and other crimes. And Giovine, , has had a bullet with his name on since turning informer on Milan’s feared ’Ndrangheta gang.  Marisa says: “It is such a celebration, as at one stage I didn’t think I would make it to .“It could have been very dferent, given my former le. Many people in my family died young because they were involved in the Mafia. “Many were gunned down or died as a result of drugs, so the fact I’m here today celebrating with Dad is very special.  It is the first time in  years he has been back to England and  years since he has left Italy. “When I met him at Manchester Airport I just hugged him so tightly, it was such an emotional reunion. I can’t believe he is here, where I have lived most of my le. It’s surreal.”  The birthday bash at a country hotel near Marisa’s Poulton-le-Fylde home marked the first time she had seen her father in more than six years. He now lives under a secret identity and is even airbrushed out of family photos. Giovine became a marked man after testying against his fellow ’Ndrangheta mobsters. He ran a drugs and arms racket before being jailed in the late s and ’s. That was when Marisa – then just  – took over, smuggling arms and cash across borders and mixing with notorious mobsters. She was jailed for two years and nine months for using £.million of laundered Mafia money to buy a house in England.  Marisa was held in Durham Prison alongside murderers Rose West and Myra Hindley. But Marisa turned her back on crime and spoke about her past in an interview with the Sunday Mirror six years ago – after a cloak-and-dagger meeting with her dad. These days, she is a contented grandmother of two. When not giving talks about her le, she is studying for an honours degree in criminology and wants to help prisoners change their lives. Marisa’s le story was turned into a book – Mafia Princess – and is being filmed for Italian Amazon Prime. She wore a Versace dress as her kids Lara, , and Frank, , joined her at her bash – and The X Factor finalists Tre Amici were the star turn.Giovine says: “I’m so proud of Marisa, she is so lovely and beautul. To be here is so wonderful. I was absent for so many birthdays that I had to be at this one. “Family is everything, to be here with Marisa in England is a dream come true. I was so emotional when I saw her, I cried like a baby. I missed out on so much and I am very sorry for that. “I was flying around the world or in prison, I didn’t spend the time with her that I should have.”  Marisa says: “There were many times Dad hasn’t been able to be there – my wedding day was one. “There was a price on his head and a gang were after him. He wasn’t able to give me away. We decided it was too risky. Thank God we did. As I pulled up in my wedding car there were men on bikes with guns waiting for him. “They wouldn’t have thought twice about killing me in the crossfire. As Dad wasn’t there they didn’t shoot but it could have been very dferent.” Marisa was born into the mob after her mum Pat – a Blackpool teenager working as an au pair in Milan – fell for Giovine. His mother Maria was known as Granny Heroin for her ­ruthless leadership of the city’s Ndrangheta gang. Anything – anyone – could be used for gain... including Marisa when she was a baby. Giovine hid contraband in her cot and in  of his car as he smuggled cigarettes across the Alps on family “holidays”.  Marisa recalls another crime run, saying: “I went to Klosters where Dad did a deal with a big arms dealer and I had to pretend I went to a posh English school.” Her parents split when she was one. Pat took Marisa back to Blackpool when she was nine. But she ed each summer and remembers, aged just , posing with a doll in one hand and her dad’s gun in the other. At , she ed to Milan and joined “the firm”. Marisa delivered up to £, to gangsters in Seville, Spain. She married henchman Bruno Merico – father to Lara.  Marisa recalls: “Dad sent Bruno and I to Calabria to pick up an arms shipment. It was a -hour drive with me, a distraction in a tight dress, sitting almost on Bruno’s knee as the weapons took up so much space. At dawn we stopped for a coffee and saw five carabinieri cars at the service stop. We decidedwe drove on and didn’t stop it would look suspicious. “So we had a coffee. By the time we were going the policemen were standing right by our Citroen. We got in and, cool as you like, took off like Bonnie and Clyde. This was our le.” Marisa also left sums of £million at drop-off points to be laundered or used to buy weapons or drugs.  She even hid money in her daughter’s carry cot – just like Giovine. When police started closing in, Marisa came back to the UK before being nicked herself. She and Bruno orced in  and she had son Frank during a relationship with Frank Birley, who was shot dead while Marisa was pregnant.

Let’s face it, pre-Markle Kate Middleton came in for a lot of flack. Back in the noughties she was nicknamed Waity Katie because she and Prince William had such a prolonged romance before marriage. Her mum was horribly labelled a social climber and, even on her wedding day, her sister Pippa stole the limelight with her figure-hugging dress. Since then she’s gone on to become an amazing mum-of-three, a fashion icon and a Queen in waiting. It was all done with quiet dignity and we barely noticed until the arrival of Meghan and all the noise she brought with her. Now we are finally hearing more from Kate, who has opened up about how tough she’s found juggling motherhood and suffers mum-guilt like the rest of us. I want to hear more. I like her. As a nation, it’s like we’ve suddenly woken up to discover who really wears the Crown. Twitter in meltdown over teabag Who would have thought Twitter would go into meltdown over a teabag  That’s exactly what happened this week when the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak tweeted a picture of himself supposedly ­making a cup of Yorkshire Tea for the Budget team. His awkward chummy picture led Tony Blair’s former spin doctor Alastair Campbell to describe him as “an ­investment banker trying not to look like an ­investment banker”. But it was the Harrogate company’s response on Twitter that left us all tittering. First they tweeted that ­“people of all political stripes” like a cuppa, pointing out that Jeremy Corbyn had been pictured with their brand in , then pleaded for a bit of kindness as the abuse got worse. Finally they told one ranter: “Sue, you’re shouting at tea!” It sparked dozens of memes and was a welcome dose of humour on a social media site renowned for its hatred, mob mentality and endless echo chamber rows. While that Sue is probably fed-up with Twitter now, it gives me a glimmer of hope that all is not lost. A quick search on the internet reveals tweets that left me in fits of laughter. A young American news reporter delivering a traffic report in the snow caused huge shrieks from tweeters when he accidentally activated his Snapchat filters while recording a piece to camera. Viewers saw reporter Justin Hinton turn into, among other things, a Star Wars pilot, a racoon and a wizard. He finished with a pair of googly eyes. Afterwards, Justin told followers he loved seeing how happy his mishap had made them. Another woman posted she had just ­realised that mamma mia sounds like a northerner telling their mother they’re home: “Mam, I’m ’ere.” Yet another posted the picture of her new credit card – complete with numbers – to show off the new blue colour.

Lauren McGarry gave birth to twins Sonny and James prematurely during an emergency C-section after doctors told her and husband James that Sonny was carrying too much fluid.The -year-old mother from Scotland told the Daily Record : As soon as James was born I heard him cry, but when Sonny came out he didnapost and they had to resuscitate him. It was absolutely terrying.Doctors suspected the babies had aposTwin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndromeaposmeaning it was unlikely both twins would survive and kept taking scans to monitor them both. But during a scan doctors noticed Sonnyaposs fluid levels were dangerously high and she had to have the baby there and then. She said: We were both terried. I just remember laying on the bed, but I was behind a curtain, but James could see all the staff in the room and he said there were dozens and dozens of them. Iaposm glad I couldnapost see because I was already terried. After trying to fit both babies with feeding tubes they realised Sonny had been born with a rare disorder called OA TOF which meant he was unable to swallow. A baby with Oesophageal atresia and Tracheo-oesophageal fistulahas a gap in his or her oesophagus which mens they are unable to swallow saliva or milk. Lauren said: We had never heard of it so we were just shocked and scared and obviously confused. The doctors were saying aposhe canapost swallowapos and I just couldnapost wrap my head around it. I mean, how can you not swallow  It was devastating. The couple were then devastated after being told Sonny would have to undergo surgery at just two days old and the family were transferred to Edinburgh Royal Hospital for Sick Children.  Sonny had a six-hour surgery to repair his oesophagus. Lauren said it was the aposmost horrendousapos six hours waiting for the operation to finish. Thankfully his operation was successful but the effects of OA TOF will impact Sonny for the rest of his le.  We feel very grateful that the surgery was successful, but we also know that Sonny will have to be careful for the rest of his le, she added. He will always be more susceptible to chest infections, reflux and coughs. He will always have to watch what he eats because although his oesophagus is now joined, it will always be narrow at that repair, so he will be more susceptible to choking. It is very scary as parents because we are currently weaning the boys and we have to be incredibly careful about what we give him to eat.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPrince Charles and Princess Dianaaposs marriage was a very complicated one, and their troubles started before they even said I Do. The heir to the throne was reportedly under a huge amount of pressure to find a royal we and settle down, so popped the question in February  after meeting Lady Spencer just  times. Diana, who was just  at the time, nervously laughed when her boyfriend got down on one knee in the nursery at Windsor Castle - but she was delighted to place the stunning sapphire engagement ring on her finger. Shortly afterwards the couple shared their happy news with the world and well-wishers started counting down the days until their Royal Wedding. And while people couldnapost get enough of what appeared to be their fairytale love story, things were very dferent behind the scenes. But as the wedding planning began Charles had to go about his royal duties as normal, and left for a tour of Australia and New Zealand just a few weeks later. Saying goodbye at such an exciting time should have been dficult for the the couple, but years later Diana admitted that something he did that day broke her heart. Royal expert Anthony Holden wrote in his book Charles: A Biography that when the future princess went to say her goodbyes to Charles, the phone rang. He claims it was Camilla.  Rather than ignoring the call and saying finishing their goodbyes, Charles is said to have picked up. Diana walked out of the room and the Prince simply started a conversation with Diana. Holden writes: [Diana] was weeping because her last minutes alone with the prince at the palace had been interrupted by a phone call. It was Camilla, wanting her own fond farewell. So tender was the conversation that Diana had felt obliged to leave. That moment, she said  years later, ‘just broke my heart.apos” Looking back at the early days of the coupleaposs relationship with the power of hindsight, there are signs that everything wasnapost as perfect as people hoped.  Former BBC News anchor Angela Rippon sat down with the couple for their final interview before the wedding. She watched it back for the first time for the Channel  documentary Charles and Di: The Truth Behind their Wedding. She said: With the knowledge of hindsight you read so much more into body language, what was said, looks that were given, reactions. Thataposs the value of hindsight isnapost it. But the final few moments of the interview really stand out to her, when she wishes the couple a letime of happiness.  Charles looks Diana, but she looks down at the floor. That expression on Dianaaposs face at the end speaks volumes. Maybe we should have read so much more into that five seconds at the end the interview. It might have told us so much more about what was to come. Before they went in they were given a briefing by the Queenaposs press secretary Michael Shea.  He told them very firmly that the interview would be endedthey asked any questions that had not been agreed. During the interview Michael stood directly behind Angela out of camera shot, but in Dianaaposs eyeline. Iaposm not quite sure how comfortable it made her feel. I got the impression that Princes Charles was very protective towards her.

Rewind  years and I was on the first series of The Apprentice, a groundbreaking show where viewers started to realise, wow, women can be as good as men in the boardroom. If not better. And The Apprentice saw a massive surge in people setting up their own ­businesses too, from the dot mavericks to the whole ­“mumpreneur” movement. It all sounds great, yet here we are in  and most kids – and their parents – still naturally presume it’s men with all the brains and ­business know-how. I just helped out with some research on this subject and, as a woman running her own business and as the mother of a daughter, I made some depressing discoveries. Only two in  children in high school could name ANY women who had set up their own ­companies. So they had no clue about Jo Malone, who sold her fragrance and candle ­business for undisclosed millions. Or Estée Lauder. Or Sahar Hashemi, who set up the first coffee chain, a certain Coffee Republic. Or even Victoria Beckham, who launched her fashion and beauty brand and is now worth millions. And  to -year-olds were more likely to think of a man when it came to making money and being bold enough to build a company. More than six out of  young girls said they have never even considered starting up their own business. We can’t blame them. They have been programmed into thinking this way. When we see successful women, whether they are on social media, TV or in magazines, the focus is still on their clothes and their hair or their make-up and their weight. Not on their talent, skills or ­business sense. But we should be championing these women and making them true role models.  We need to give our young girls the confidence to believe they can have their own business – and the country will be better for it too. It is thought up to £billion could be added to our economywomen started and scaled new businesses at the same rate as UK men. Imagine that  If girls just had a bit more faith in themselves and their ability to start and run their own business.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThese amazing and selfless ­teenagers are taking singing from the same song sheet to a whole new level. Not only do they perform in a choir but they are also united by the ­sacrices they make in their personal lives. Each of them juggle school work with caring for their parents or siblings with le-limiting illnesses such as chronic pain, autism, multiple sclerosis and depression. The ten-strong Young Carers Aloud is the brainchild of Laura Jones, , who single-handedly cared for her mum after she had a nervous breakdown ­followed, in , by a heart attack. Five years ago Laura, who volunteered at young carers’ charity Action for Children from  and studied theatre and media at ­university, hoped to start a song-writing workshop. She said: “I wanted to use performance and music to help these amazing young people. “Singing was always my therapy, my way to heal and find a calm place, and I wanted these little heroes to ­experience that too. “I know how hard it can be to find the time and cover to come to ­rehearsalsyou’re a full-time carer, but I did everything I could do make that dream a reality. Then a colleague of mine at the charity suggested I put a choir together to sing them.” Since then Young Carers Aloud, the UK’s first choir made up solely of young carers, has recorded an album of their own material.  They have also starred in a ­musical and performed at London venues ­including in front of  people in St Paul’s ­Cathedral last October. Laura, of Mountain Ash, Rhondda, said: “I’m like Sister Mary Clarence from Sister Act, getting these children who’ve never sung before not just to enjoy themselves but to find their own voices and also create the tightest possible bonds. “Nothing brings you together more than singing in a choir, and being a carer can be the loneliest, crushing experience ­imaginable. I grew up in poverty as a carer but was adamant I’d make something of my le. I owe that to music. “I held down three jobs to afford to go to university and I made it. I wanted to bring that strength back to The Valleys, to give these kids who dedicate their lives to others ­opportunities and friendships which will last a letime.” Caitlin Brewis, age  Caitlin, who goes to Cardinal Newman RC Comprehensive in Pontypridd, has been a carer since she was nine years old, and joined the choir last year. She said: “My younger brother Zach, who’s eight years old now, is severely autistic, and because my mum and dad are separated and mum works night shts, I spend a lot of time dealing with Zach. I have to get up early to prep him for school, make his breakfast and do all the little jobs a parent would. “It’s exhausting in a way nobody  could really understand unless they’re a carer. “Being out of the house with people my age who get me, it’s a leline. My favourite song is We Will Rise Again, showing we’re stronger together. It hits the nail on the head.”  Caitlyn Homer-Hughes, age  Caitlin has been a carer for her mum Gail since she was diagnosed with MS eight years ago. The pupil at Ysgol Gyfun Rhydywaun comprehensive in the Rhondda Valley had never sung before joining the choir three years ago. She said: “Everyday tasks for mum are just impossible so I have to do everything from cooking to washing Mum’s hair. It’s also really hard for Mum, who feels so guilty for putting me in this position. “Rehearsals, performances, and trips away are the highlight of every month.”  Ffion Corcoran, age  Ffion has juggled studying at Aberdare Community School with caring for her mum Donna, who suffers from depression and anxiety, for the past two years. She said: “Our nan, Mum’s mum, died two years ago and it massively hit her, leaving me almost overnight to pick up the pieces. It’s so hard, getting up at am to prep my younger sisters Cerys and Bronwyn for school, as well as helping out at home with everything . “In the choir I feel at home and happy for the first time in so long. I forget how tired I am when I’m singing.” Corey Barker, age  Corey says the choir is a relief from years of caring for his mum and sister, . The Treorchy Comprehensive pupil’s mum has chronic back pain. He said: “Some days mum’s in so much pain she can’t get out of bed, so I have to cook, clean, do the shopping. It’s become the norm now but it doesn’t get any easier. “The songs we sing make us all feel less isolated. I regularly well-up when I’m singing, the emotion is so powerful and healing. It’s a blessing being part of this.”  Kasey Chapman, age  A first-year student at Coleg Y Cymoedd Nantgarw, Kasey has been a carer for eight years for her mum Natasha, who has severe endometriosis and is in chronic pain She said: “As well as mum, I also have my younger brother Cameron, who’s , and sister Leora, who’s nine, so I’m often up very late at night to get all my coursework done. “It feels like every single minute of the day I’m looking after someone , doing laundry or cooking, or helping with homework, not to mention emotionally supporting mum. “In the choir we share stories and laugh so much. We can relate to each other, and hearing someone next to me singing lyrics about being together, being stronger, it puts a huge smile on all our faces. “All of us are heroes.” Arrabella Eames,  Arrabella looks after both parents while a pupil at St John the Baptist High in Aberdare.Since she was nine she has been caring for mum Claire, who has chronic pain after a bus accident  years ago. Dad Stephen, is a diabetic and has arthritis .She said: “As well as all the chores I often help Mum and Dad get dressed as well as being strong for them, which isn’t easy. Putting Mum and Dad first has obviously taken its toll, which is why the choir is a great escape. It’s better than any medication. Each song is so beautul and personal.”  Arwen Braddock,  Arwen has been a carer since she could “walk and talk”. The Mountain Ash pupil’s twin brother Ewan has extreme anxiety, dyspraxia and other issues. She said: “My dad works full time and my mum suffers from depression so I’ve had help with everything from cooking meals, sorting out his unorm, helping re-teach him stuff from school. “If I ever get a chance to see my friends, I often have to head back early to deal with a situation. The choir is a safe, healing place where everybody understands what you’re going through.” Brodie Townsend, aged  Five years ago Brodie became a carer for her mum, Wendy, when she was diagnosed with severe PTSD and depression. Brodie Townsend, , is in her second year at college at Coleg y Cymoedd Llwynypia in Rhonda. She said: “Because mum’s not allowed to work, it’s up to me to cook, clean, and look after her as well as my younger brothers Stanley, , and Murdoch, . My dad left us when I was  and we moved town, so every morning I’m at am to make breakfast for everyone and clean up before dashing to college, then the moment I’m home it’s non-stop, too. “The choir gives me energy, helps me concentrate and brings me out of my shell.” Keira Phillips, age   For four years Keira has cared for her mum Sharon – who has anxiety, depression, PTSD and is bipolar – while studying at Aberdare Community School. She said: “I have to make sure mum takes all her tablets, take her to doctors’ appointments, as well as doing all the home stuff. On a bad day I have to get Mum out of bed andshe’s in a bad way, take time out of school, which means I’m playing catch-up at break and lunch. My two older sisters, Beth and Charlotte, moved out of home a few years ago. “In the choir I feel like I’m me, I’m alive again. I remember how performing in front of over  people at St Paul’s Cathedral last year was mind-blowing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast storm jorge","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Storm Jorge to lash Britain with mph winds for second dayStorm Jorge continues to bring destruction to the country with mph, showers and snow across parts of Scotland and northern England on Sunday morning, the Met Office saysShareCommentsByTfany Lo:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsThe Environment Agency warned of flooding as Storm Jorge continues to bring persistent rainfall to communities \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Horses, dogs and cats were rescued from a dilapidated property filled with dead creatures, with some carcasses so decomposed they could not be identied. Rescue charity - the Green Valley Brittany - discovered the horror with horses and donkeys being found with horrically overgrow hooves and cats and dogs surrounded in the property by dead animals. Laura Kling, president of the charity, has been working all week to recover the animals. She was called to the house which she says was occupied by two women, one who recently died. Her daughter reportedly suffered from mental health issues and was taken to hospital. The  animals had been living in terrible conditions for weeks, with many having already died. It is thought the wealthy owners, who lived in Saint-Hernin, Brittany, north west France, collected pure breeds. Laura added: This case is absolutely tragic and shows the harsh reality of mental illness.  Laura said: We checked out the horses and donkeys that were in the field and straight away saw the horror of what has been going on. All the horses have overgrown hooves, one was so bad he could no longer stand or walk. If we hadnapost come out that day we have no doubt that he would have been dead by morning. The charity managed to get a farrier to the farm to smooth down the hooves, and help the horse get to its feet.  Laura continued: We have never seen a horse with such overgrown hooves before.Heaposd endured so much suffering and probably been down on the ground in the horrendous stormy weather for some time.Unbelievably only one week before, two people had also been living in this place. The animals in the house were visibly traumatized and really fearful.  Incredibly, eventually the dogs and cats came out for cuddles, Laura said. Green Valley is now trying to care for and rehome all of the animals to Brits living in France and is asking for donations from all around the world to help them. People reacted in shock to the images on social media. Julie Franklin said: Absolutely horrendous. I canapost imagine what these poor animals have been through. I hope they will all survive and find their forever homes.

The bold assertion was made by Carl Goldman, who caught the disease while on the Diamond Princess which is currently docked off Japan. The -year-old left the ship at the end of a -day cruise two weeks ago, underwent tests and then boarded a bus to the airport.Along with his we, Carl was put on a US Government plane and flown to Travis Air Force base in Calornia, he told the Washington Post. It was only once he arrived in an area cordoned off with sheets of plastic that his burning hot C temperature came to light. Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention then took the couple to a quarantine location at the University of Nebraska hospital on February . There the KHTS radio owner from Santa Claita, Calornia was wheeled on a stretcher to a biocontainment unit where he was securely locked away from the outside world. With world class doctors monitoring his vital signs and feeding him vitamins and minerals through a drip, Carl had time to reflect on the disease, which he said was less severe than a bout of bronchitis he previously suffered.  This has been much easier: no chills, no body aches, I breathe easily, and I don’t have a stuffy nose, he told the Washington Post. My chest feels tight, and I have coughing spells. If I were at home with similar symptoms, I probably would have gone to work as usual. Carl was quick to find some positives in his situation.  As well as spending his ten days in the biocontainment unit catching up with some work on his laptop, he relished some time away from his we, who tested negative and was quarantined where. While he still tested positive for the disease, he does not require much medical care and will be released when he passes three tests in a row. Carl recommended that people worried about coronavirus acquire a digital thermometer to put their mind at easetheir nose begins to run.Coronavirus doesn’t  have  to be a horrible calamity, he concluded.

It was a tight call but the striker was onside.The victory however was tempered by an injury to centre-back Scott McKenna who was replaced early in the second half.Scotland international McKenna pulled up when racing against Jon Obika to win a through ball. The problem looked to be the defender#s hamstring.Aberdeen made two changes to the side that lost - at home to Ross County last weekend.Having recovered from a gash to a knee that required  stitches midfielder Funso Ojo ed.January signing Matty Kennedy, a substitute against Staggies,  also ed to the starting XI.Dropping out were leading scorer Sam Cosgrove and Connor McLennan.Curtis Main, who netted against Ross County, was given the nod ahead of Cosgrove to lead the Dons attack in the bid to get to Hampden.Aberdeen created the opening opportunity in the third minute when Campbell flighted in a free kick from the left flank to find the onrushing Curtis Main but his powerful  yard header flew over.The Reds went ahead in the seventh minute courtesy of a superb finish from midfielder Lewis FERGUSONWinger Matty Kennedy broke down the left flank and rolled a pass into Ferguson#s path.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-gallery-strikes-gold-new-exhibition","story":"A BORDERS-based artist is bringing some Byzantine influence to a small museum in Selkirk.From next month gold will dominate Halliwells House as Alexandra Warren launches her exhibition in the Robson Gallery.Born in New York and raised in Greece, Alexandra developed a love of Cycladic sculpture and Byzantine icons.And despite spending the past  years in the Scottish Borders her work is still heavily influenced by the continuation of the Roman Empire.Her magnicent human figures and extensive use of gold leaf reflect a letimes influence.Alexandra told us: ldquoIrsquom very happy and honoured to have the opportunity of a solo exhibition in the lovely Robson Gallery in the historic Halliwellrsquos House, Selkirk.ldquoIrsquoll be presenting large figurative pieces and a series of small figurative paintings.\"Each piece is created with gold leaf, paint and shellac on wood , all inspired by Greek Byzantine icons - since I was lucky enough to have spent my childhood in Greece.rsquorsquoThe Traces of Gold exhibition opens on Saturday, March  and runs until the end of May.Assistant curator Phoebe Stewart said: ldquoWersquore delighted that Alexandra Warren is exhibiting with us in the Robson Gallery at Halliwellrsquos House.\"Her exquisite work, reminiscent of Greek Byzantine art, is a must-see.\""},{"url":null,"title":"jim-clark-driving-trail-cover-scenic-borders","story":"A CROSS-BORDERS driving trail has been created for visitors wanting to learn more about rallying icon, Jim Clark.The -mile adventure trail will take drivers on a tour of the Borders with pit-stops showcasing regional beauty spots as well as locations steeped in motorsport history.Launched by the Jim Clark Trust, the trail hopes to engage visitors and help them discover the places and stories behind the former double Formula One Champion, Clark.The trail starts and ends at the Jim Clark Motorsport Museum, Duns, and is completely free of charge as it is designed to enhance the experience had at the museum.From the museum, a trail map guides visitors to Chirnside, Jim Clarks hometown and final resting place, then to Berwick-Upon-Tweed where Jim began his racing career.

finances required for a new Peebles High School.Local Conservative council leader Shona Haslam and the local authoritys education portfolio holder Carol Hamilton hit out earlier this month at what they claimed was a financial snub from the Scottish Government.Their claims infuriated Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who reiterated Holyroods commitment to help following the school fire in November.But last weeks budget announcement by the Conservative Independent administration has now sparked a fresh row.According to the figures presented a new Peebles High will cost around pound million - with only pound million coming from an insurance settlement.The claim that there will be a pound million deficit has led to MSP Christine Grahame seeking clarication.The councils chief finance officer David Robertson has confirmed that Peebles High has an insurance value of pound million.And that the local authority is working with loss adjuster appointed by Zurich on a final settlement - expected to be made next month.But the correspondence has now thrown up more questions, with Ms Grahame demanding to know where a pound million deficit will occur.She told us: \"The claims being made by Councillor Haslam and her Tory colleagues are going to be massively concerning for the school community.\"As soon as the scale of the damage from the fire was apparent I wrote to SBC to check that insurance would cover the cost of rebuilding ndash I was told yes, it should.ldquoCllr Haslam has already been caught in one lie by saying the Scottish Government has refused funding for the rebuild when SBC have never requested it. And why would itit was covered by insurance ldquoIs it the case that the insurance company has rejected a claim for new build and will pay only for reinstatement of the damaged areas  If that is the case then she should come clean. She is claiming the school faces a pound million deficit.\"The only explanation I can offer is that this is the cost of replacement of damaged areas but on this Ms Haslam is silent.ldquoI await her response, but in the interim I would ask her seriously to desist in trying to play politics with this to get a disingenuous hit on the Scottish Government and SNP.\"It serves no one and is unnecessarily causing genuine concern amongst the local community when efforts should be going into ing stability and normality to students, parents and staff.Scottish Borders Councils administration has committed to delivering replacement secondary schools in Galashiels, Hawick and Peebles in the next six years.Councillor Haslam believes that an improved replacement school for Peebles school along with using parts of the remaining building needs to be factored in to the calculations.In a response to Christine Grahame, she said: \"As you are well aware the insurance will only pay to replace what was lost.\"This will still result in a music department in a windowless basement and a science department in labs that are not fit for purpose.\"Despite this our school continues to produce first class scientists and musicians but I believe they deserve more and better.\"We had planned to replace Peebles High School in the next  years. To only do part of the school now would be a  economy and impact on future plans to replace outdated buildings.\"I know how keen you are to see a new High School delivered in Galashiels so am perplexed as to why you are so against Peebles getting the same facilities  Perhaps you could clary  I am certainly not satisfied with half measures for our young people.\"We are also extremely keen to ensure that other towns developments are not held back as a result of this fire. So Galashiels and Hawick remain on schedule to be delivered. This means that our Conservative led council will be delivering three new High schools, two new primary schools in the next six years, quite an achievement as I am sure you will agree.\"This is held

You could always depend on Roly to anchor an innings, while he had a knack of picking up quick wickets when he came on to bowl.Golf was another sport at which he excelled, twice winning the Woollen Merchants  Manufacturers Cup, competed for annually at Sunningdale. The ornate trophy is kept on display at the British Golf Museum in St Andrews.As well as being a member of Peebles Golf Club, he also held memberships with Luffness Golf Club in East Lothian and Port Salon Golf Club in Donegal, close to Rathmullan where his father moved after retiring from the army.An interest in classic cars led to the ownership of a number of models being kept at Walkerburn over the years, including a vintage Daimler, Porsche and Mercedes SL.In  Mr Brett was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia, a progressive condition affecting behaviour, personality and speech.As the disease began to take its inevitable toll, the love and support shown by Betty, members of his family and close friends , in addition to the kindness and understanding shown by staff in the BGHrsquos Cauldshiels Ward and at Murray House, Kelso, ensured Roly received the best possible care in his final months.Mr Brett is survived by Betty and their four sons, his sister Jo, brother Will, daughters-in-law Denise, Shona, Debbie and Mumba, and by eight grandchildren.A service of thanksgiving for Roly Brettrsquos le will be held in the Borders Crematorium, Melrose, on Tuesday, March , at pm.J.D.R.S."},{"url":null,"title":"dates-confirmed-2020-innerleithen-music-festival","story":"ORGANISERS have announced that this years Innerleithen Music Festival will take place during the weekend of August -to-.Now in its th year the festival continues to provide a great  for fantastic music in the heart of the Borders.True to its tradition there will be events taking place across multiple venues in Innerleithen.And, as usual, much of the activity will be centred at the Vale Club where lsquoLive and Localrsquo will be staged over the three days.Andy Wright from Innerleithen Music Festival said: \"The Innerleithen Music Festival has a strong reputation amongst artists and audience alike.\"Bands and singers approach us throughout the year enquiring about performance opportunities.\"Over the years we have showcased hundreds of bands and solo performers from across Scotland and farther afield, including such household names as Eddie Reader, Capercaillie, Skipinnish as well as traditional music favourites Phil and Aly.\"Last year one of our largest audiences was for local musician and rising star Tommy Ashby who is currently carving out a great reputation on the national music scene.\"Ahead of the festival this summer a fundraising concert will be held in the Union Club on Saturday, March .Already confirmed for next months concert are Redwood Rejects, Soul , All the Angels, Bobs Boiler Room and Dylan Paterson.Tickets go on sale from lsquoThe Hub on the High Streetrsquo, Innerleithen on March ."},{"url":null,"title":"gareths-newspaper-snaps-help-replace-peebles-high-camera","story":"A local photographer who captured haunting images of firefighters tackling the blaze at Peebles High School has donated the profits of his pictures to the school.Award winning photographer Gareth Easton was in Peebles when his children, both pupils at Peebles High, called to say the school was on fire.This week he spoke to reporter and former colleague Hilary Scott, about how he turned his pictures of the pupils running from the burning school, into an image of students with beaming smiles.INNERLEITHEN photographer Gareth Easton has snapped murder scenes, G riots, drugs raids, and even gambled with his own le aboard a trawler by capturing the danger inherent in commercial fishing ndash which netted him a national award.Never did he imagine that his next big job would be photographing the inferno of the secondary school both his children attend.ldquoOn the day of the fire I was working in Peebles.

You should self-isolateyou have travelled to any of the following places:to Hubei province in China in the last  daysto Iran, areas of northern Italy in lockdown or \"special care zone\" areas in South Korea since  Februaryto other parts of mainland China or South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last  days and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathto other parts of northern Italy , Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos or Myanmar since  February and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathHow do I self-isolate The best place to self-isolate yourself is obviously your own home, where you should stay for the duration of your quarantine.This means you shouldnt go to work, school or public areas, and not use any public transport or taxis.If you need something from outside your home, you canask friends, family members or delivery services to carry out errands for you.But youre advised to try to avoid visitors to your home, though it is OK for friends and family or delivery drivers to drop off food and other supplies.WhatIm not at home Of course, its possible that any coronavirus symptoms could arise while youre out and about.If this is the case, the official advice insists that you do not go to a GP surgery or hospital, as that could spread the virus inordinately.Instead, you should try to find a room to isolate yourself away from others. Ask for helpyou need to, but try to stay at least two metres away from other people.Open a window for ventilationyou can, but otherwise touch objects and surfaces as little as possible, and call  for advice.If you find yourself on public transport and become unwell, you should go back to your home or place of residence immediately.How long should I self-isolate for ,params: .pushYou may need to do

to try and minimise the spread of the Coronavirus.Nicole Rogers, Solicitor at DAS Law, has been looking at the impact this has on workers rights and pay.If I feel that I should be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, can my employer deduct my pay for the time I am away from work This will depend on the facts.If you are otherwise fit for work but are taking precautionary steps by lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, technically you are not entitled to pay.However, it is good practice for employers not to deduct pay in these situations.An employee would usually be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo on the advice of a doctor and it is sensible for an employer to show understanding in order to fulfil health and safety obligation and maintain good staff relations.In addition, to withhold pay could encourage an employee toto work prematurely which might potentially risk spreading the virus.Many employers can allow temporary flexible working arrangements where employees can work from home.What are my rightsIrsquom quarantined and my boss refuses to pay my salary If you have contracted the virus, normal rules around sick pay will apply and you will either receive Statutory Sick Payor contractual sick pay.If your employer has specically told you not to come into the workplace as you have been in or to an affected area, you would ordinarily receive your normal pay.What is unclear is a situation where an employee remains off work as they have been quarantined or recommended to isolate themselves.In those circumstances, it would not strictly be considered as sick as the reason for the absence isnrsquot because the employee is unwell and therefore has no entitlement to sick pay.There may be a contractual clause relating to such circumstances and how this time off should be paid.In the absence of any contractual clause, the position will be that the leave will be unpaid .Can I be forced to use my annual leaveI am lsquoself-isolatingrsquo You cannot be forced to use annual leaveyou are medically unfit for work.However in many other circumstances, your employer can force you to take annual leavethey provide you with adequate notice twice the amount of the days you are being forced to take.For example, to force you to use  daysrsquo holiday, your employer must give you  daysrsquo notice.Again, this may risk good staff relations and given that employers and employees will likely be unfamiliar in dealing with a health crisis of this magnitude, it will be good practice for both parties to mutually agree how leave will be taken.,params: .pushWill I be paid

annual leave.If I am on a lsquozero hoursrsquo contract will I lose pay for the time I am away from work Genuine zero-hour workers have no right to be offered work and no obligation to accept

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride. She was the bringer of light and plentul times, and so people loved her and looked forward to her arrival. Beria was jealous orsquo her.ldquoThis is why Beria kept Bride a prisoner. She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis. She wanted tae keep winter going sae her power would last longer. She whipped up a gale wi a wind sae cauld and sharp it felt like a bird pecking at yer skin. It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength. She bade her time there, kenning she would be able taeand reclaim her throne when darkness once again ed tae the land.ldquoIn autumn, said one of the children.ldquoAye, smiled the gran.ldquoAnd thatrsquos why we hae arsquo these winds and storms just noo.

And we still hae the three days orsquo snaw tae come, but ater that Beria will huv tae flee.ldquoWhy didnrsquot they kill Beria, then itrsquoll be summer all the time  asked one of the older children.The gran smiled. ldquoAngus was Beriarsquos son.

They warn many areas are now at ldquocrisis point.In an interview to be published in tomorrowrsquos Herald on Sunday, Mr Kerley said a wide-ranging review could help shape a sustainable future for local government.He said: ldquoI think it would be helpful to have another review of what we expect local government to do, and how we expect local government to do it.ldquoWhat is appropriate to charge for and not charge for  Because that makes a signicantdference in terms of the usage of facilities and services.He added: ldquoI donrsquot think it can be done by just saying, lsquoOkay, wersquoll increase this tax or that tax, or stop doing thatrsquo.The academic said the review could examine what services Scots expect councils to deliver, ldquoand how we might raise some of the money to do that, some of which could be raised locally, some of which would be raised through general taxation as it is now.He said it could involve representatives from all of Scotlandrsquos councils and the government ldquoand citizens as well.Mr Kerley, professor of management at Queen Margaret University, said: ldquoWersquove seen experiments in terms of the Citizens Assembly.You could incorporate something like that ndash plus people who have a particular interest.He said the current Citizensrsquo Assembly of Scotland, which brings together more than  people randomly recruited from across the country to discuss key issues facing it, has shown such an exercise is ldquoperfectly possible.In the years since devolution, there have been a number of reviews set up to consider local taxation.In , the Local Government Finance Review Committee proposed a ldquoradical alternative to council tax. Itrecommended a ldquonew progressive Local Property Tax... based on the capital value of inidual properties.Around a decade later, the Commission on Local Tax Reform recommended a programme of changes, including multiple forms of tax and a review of central grants.The Barclay Review into business rates in  also examined the role of local authorities.Mr Kerley said it is ldquoundisputed the proportion of central government spend that has gone to support local government over the past X years has been decreasing gradually compared to other areas of spend.It comes as Scotlandrsquos council leaders yesterday expressed disappointment that the agreed Budget deal only makes good the underfunding of new and existing commitments required by the Scottish Government and does nothing to address inflationary or demand pressures.It also fails to make any restoration of the signicant cuts to Local Government core funding in previous years.Leaders agreed that, as such, the settlement represents a  per cent or poundmillion cut in real terms in revenue funding for Local Government.Council Leaders instructed the Convention of Scottish LocalAuthorities to continue to lobby strongly for the additional % funding for inflationary pressures and % for restoration of previous funding cuts and for restoration of the poundm cut to the capital allocation.Mr Kerley said: ldquoThere clearly comes a point where councils have to say, as they have been saying for years, some of them, lsquowe canrsquot keep trimming a bit off here and a bit off there, and turning the lights off earlierrsquo and stuff like that.ldquoIn the longer term, you canrsquot provide for increased public services without increasing the flow of money into that ndash whether thatrsquos through taxation or charging, and wersquove generally resisted charging of ious kinds, though everywhere you look where councils are enabled to charge they are increasing the charges they are putting on things.ldquoAnd they are testing out, with for example musical tuition, whether they can charge for that. I think thatrsquos going to be an interesting test of legal commitment and legal powers and legal authority when it ndash as I think it will ndash goes into court in some shape or form.Mr Kerley said local authorities charging for services has always been ldquoa bit of a tangle, adding: ldquoWe charge for some things and we donrsquot charge for others. Some of them are statutorily protected in terms of charging. You canrsquot charge for lending library books,but you can charge for the lateof library books.ldquoYou charge for theatres, you charge for going into a swimming pool ndash how much you charge is a matter of what you need to raise and what you think people will pay.He said reforming council tax is ldquoone possibility, but added the ldquobig challenge for any government is the notion that you can, through a local property tax and indeed through income tax, make all of this additional money up through just affecting wealthy people or rich people...[it] just doesnrsquot hold.Councils argue funding provided by the Scottish Government is often ringfenced, funnelling extra cash directly into areas chosen by ministers, such as the expansion of free childcare.But Mr Kerley said the degree of ring-fencing ldquois considerably less than it was  or  years ago.He said: ldquoItrsquos reduced, but itrsquos now creeping back up again ndash I think most obviously with nursery education, because the huge commitment to, in a sense double, the amount of nursery education available for three and fouryear-olds meant councils had to create often purpose-built facilities or improve the ones they had, increase staffing and so on.

All education would be fee-paying, of course, with the most successful schools free to charge exorbitantly for their services.School departments might be sponsored by firms specialising in the appropriate disciplines. Thus, the science department with its partners Evonik, Pfizer and Biogen would be pleased to offer a suite of subjects tailored to meet the demands of a changing world. Maths would be brought to you by Tesla Inc and foreign languages would be the preserve of international airlines and holiday firms. English could be sponsored by Penguin, Harper Collins or Bloomsbury. Obviously, these firms would expect teachers to ensure their contracted authors featured heavily in their reading lists.Further down the scale, local firms might be invited to tender for subjects in those schools unable to compete financially with the elite FTSE establishments. These would be solid enough performers and might get your child into a half-decent polytechnic and a career as an army specialist.As well as league tables for exam results there would be something similar for teachers. This would operate like the draft system for US gridiron stars. Top schools would be prepared to pay huge salaries for teachers who can spin an A from a C- with the densest of materials.:Opinion Matrix: Power battles and realities of societyIn terms of discipline, parents would be expected to sign a sort of educational pre-nup. This would effectively permit a school to discipline a child as they saw fit and indemny teachers in the event of any physical or mental damage sustained by the child.As with all pure market-driven industries the dross would be quietly discarded. Children whose parents were unable to afford even the most basic fees would be taken to educational lsquofarmsrsquo where they would be given basic instruction on physical fitness and mechanical and household maintenance. Each year in these places there would be a Hunger Games type of competition where the prize could be a free education at one of the top schools. Those firms with an authentic sense of social mission at their core would bestow scholarships for the children of factory workers with long and unblemished service records.The overall effect achieved by such a system would be to ensure that power and wealth was retained within tight clusters of the right sort. Sounds ridiculous Well, in effect, itrsquos how Britainrsquos independent and fee-paying school system works. The essential alchemy at the heart of these places has little to do with achieving academic excellence and instilling lofty values. Bright pupils excelling at a fee-paying school would also have done so at a state establishment.Letrsquos be honest here their main attraction lies in masking the intellectual weaknesses of the less able offspring of rich families, thus sparing them having to work with common people who donrsquot just wear overalls for fishing. It also explains many of the catastrophic events in British military history some decisions taken in the run-up to the banking crisis and the tenure of the Bush family and Donald Trump in the White House.The results of a survey published this week found that more than a third of Edinburgh residents felt that a childrsquos social class had a material effect on their academic school performances. This compared with just % in Glasgow. The numbers are hardly surprising when you factor in how many children attend fee-paying schools in Edinburgh: currently around one in five and the highest percentage of such in the UK.:Herald Society heroes honoured for their work helping othersIrsquom not entirely sure that this suggests Edinburgh people are more class-conscious than in Glasgow or somehow more snobbish in their attitudes.

It would be instructiveMy Tutor, the online tutoring service which conducted the survey, undertook also to ask people to what extent they felt that a childrsquos natural ability affected academic performance. Perhaps this is too dficult to measure.It certainly seems beyond the wit of any British or Scottish Government to attempt to do so. As things stand we assume that children born into challenging social circumstances must be of low academic ability. We judge them purely on exam results and fail to factor in the daily challenges of health inequality and multi-deprivation. We know that none can afford private tuition, the favourite means by which affluent but academically unremarkable children can tilt the playing field. The failure of British society to find more imaginative ways of unlocking the potential of poor children must cost this country billions every year in health and social security spending and crime prevention.Perhaps then they could borrow on the notion of pure, market-driven schools and customise them to meet the needs of the many rather than the few. Irsquod grant major global firms as well as local companies a suite of incentives to provide direct funding of local authority schools in our most disadvantaged neighbourhoods. They would have no influence on educational policy. As part of the deal they would also provide employment opportunities for pupils in these schools.Funding could range from meeting the salaries of extra teachers providing resource materials and paying for overseas trips. They would meet the cost of tutors for bright children and grant them meaningful internships, currently the exclusive preserve of affluent pupils whose parents have good professional connections.Boris Johnson talked about a process of ldquolevelling up to address regional inequalities in British society.

Allies of Cherry feel Robertsonrsquos fingerprints are all over some of the moves that have been made against her within the Westminster group over the last year or so.Cherry, currently the MP for Edinburgh South West, has become one of the most recognised parliamentarians at Westminster since she won her seat in , feared and admired in equal measure. She was instrumental in defeating Boris Johnsonrsquos plan to sabotage parliament late last year and is a formidable speaker from the floor of the House. This has caused jealousy among lesser-plumed party colleagues who have dutully toiled in the party for years without any recognition. ldquoShersquos just in the door five minutes, they say, ldquoand already shersquos coveting Nicolarsquos job.

Irsquom proud of her and of how well shersquos represented the cause of Scottish independence. I want to support her in leading Scotland to independence and in securing ourto the European Union. I certainly have my dferences with her, not least on her support for the proposed reforms of the Gender recognition Act, but more unites us than ides us.Ah yes, the Gender Recognition Act: never has something so scarcelyunderstoodby the vast majority of the general population caused so much turbulence within the gilded chambers of a political party. For those who inhabit the world outside cyberspace and the political bubble this is what it means. The Scottish Government wants to make it much easier for people to change their gender by enabling them to \"self-declare\"rather than endure a prolonged process. Cherry and other feminists within the SNP, most notably Joan McAlpine, convenor of Holyroodrsquos influential Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Affairs Committee, have urged caution.Both women have endured abuse and intimidation from within the party for expressing concerns for womenrsquos sex-based rightsthe proposed GRA reforms come to pass. Cherry is careful to say that the abuse has come from ldquothe tiniest of factions who wield ldquodisproportionate influence.ldquoAs an out gay woman who fought section  and has campaigned for LGBT rights for decades, accusations that I am transphobic are offensive. The online abuse does take its toll but I am more worried about the cumulative and detrimental effect on what it does for the role of women in politics and in the media young women in particular. I donrsquot like the way this is characterised as a problem in the youth wing of the party.:MP Joanna Cherry: Scotland will be ignored at WestminsterldquoMany admirable young people are involved in Scottish politics and I know a number of women and men in Young Scots for Independence and SNP Youth who have spoken to me privately about their concerns. The abuse is deeply misogynistic. The attacks on me and other women in the party are clearly a breach of our code of conduct and must be dealt with.ldquoIrsquom very proud of the fact that in Scotland we have very good rights-based protections for trans people. No one is seeking to change that. However, women have legitimate concerns about the proposed changes to the law on gender recognition.Within the SNPrsquos Westminster group you sense she is admired rather than loved and therersquos not a little resentment at her high profile. One of her party colleagues at Holyrood has been aghast at her treatment at Westminster: ldquoShersquos a really sharp intellect, as forensic in her approach to politics as she was to the law. She does have what Burns called a guid conceit o hersel. This is admired and expected in male leaders, but women are held to a dferent standard and expected to show humility. She needs to build alliances though that is the clubby bit of politics which can evade hard-working women and allow mediocre men to advance.Cherry challenges my suggestion that the party could do without this contest in Edinburgh Central. ldquoCompetition in politics is healthy, she says. ldquoDebating ideas is good for developing policy. This isnrsquot being disloyal to the leadership. Holyrood and Westminster proceed by debate this is how we get to the nub of things.The fabled independence Plan B, which the party rejected last year, has ed for inspection now that Boris Johnson simply wonrsquot discuss a second independence referendum. This is another area where Cherry is perceived to be at odds with her boss. She rejects this.ldquoI wouldnrsquot back a wildcat or illegal referendum. How could I, given my legal background  I endorse Nicolarsquos declaration that this should proceed legally. However we have reached an impasse: people keep voting for us and opinion polls show support for Yes is hovering around %, yet Johnson wonrsquot budge.ldquoMy experience of knocking on doors is that there are lots of soft Nos who are interested in the idea of Scotland staying in the EU through independence. But we have to look at the economy and currency the process of getting back into the EU and how longrsquos it going to take. We must also deal with the border with England and de-dramatise it. The idea that people wonrsquot be able to have a cup of tea in Berwick without showing their passport is ludicrous. Wersquore all in the common travel area.\"Cherry is keen to stress that seeking a ruling from the Supreme Court on Holyroodrsquos competence to hold a referendum without Londonrsquos agreement does not amount to support for a wildcat vote.\"If we pass a bill through Holyrood to hold a referendum this might be challenged by the UK governmentrsquos law officer and then arrive at the Supreme Court. Any organisation could challenge it. Under section  of the Scotland Act within four weeks of a Bill passing the Advocate General, the Attorney General or the Scotlandrsquos Lord Advocate could choose to refer the question of the Billrsquos competence to the Supreme Court.ldquoIt would be for them to decide by a process of statutory interpretation whether this Bill was within the powers of Holyrood. Irsquod hope they wouldnrsquot just look at the Act but note the two countriesrsquo markedly dferent routes of travel and all the recent democratic votes in several political jurisdictions. If they said the Bill was within Holyroodrsquos competence wersquod have our referendum. Andnot I donrsquot think wersquod lose anything.Cherry would probably have been a judge by nowshersquod continued her legal career, with the prospect of earning much more money. She had a stellar career specialising in prosecuting sexual offence cases. Why did she choose this uncertain and venomous arena where party rules canrsquot prevent a woman from experiencing abuse and venom simply for adhering to long-held principles ldquoIf Irsquod known it would be like this I wouldnrsquot have stood for election, she says, ldquoand itrsquos sad that women might be put off entering politics because of it.

Utter pfle most of them. Great Expectations  None at all as it turns out. Anna Karenina  No naughty bits, just interminable longueurs. I could go on ndash just donrsquot get me started on Ibsen. These are not my opinions but are based on impeccable research and academic rigour by two noted writers and scholars, Ford Madox Ford and Michael Caine.In Woody Allenrsquos film Hannah And Her Sisters, Caine, the husband, tells a woman that she reminds him of a love poem on page  of a book of poetry by EE cummings. This established the literary principle thatthat page is interesting, transcendent or whatever, then the beginning and end must be startlingly brilliant, because everyone knows that authors and editors put the most attention into these bits.It spawned a French literary award, the Prix de la Page , which was created in . Last yearrsquos was awarded to French writer Jacques Jouet who wrote a book of poetry while riding on the Paris , which is a lot more interesting than the poems. Or the Stagecoach Number  from Ayr.Madox Ford, in a dferent page take, wrote: ldquoOpen the book at page  and read and the quality of the whole book will be revealed.So it is from these instructions that I turned to Anna Karenina, first to page  which opens with a paper kne scraping on a window and ends with ldquoshe rose, threw off her wrap and took off the cape of her coat. Thatrsquos as steamy as it gets. Then on page  ldquothe coffee boiled over and splashed everybody. Thatrsquos as exciting as it gets.Dickens is no better. On page  of his opus,the high point is Mr Wopsle and ldquoa snarling passage from Richard the Third. And on , Pip wanders about a ldquogarden full of old hats and boots. No savage beasts in the undergrowth, unfortunately.As for the idolised Madox Ford, he should have followed his own advice. Page  of Paradersquos Endrsquos highpoint is the Rev Horsley and the writer Mrs Wannop ndash not swallowing tea and scones, tearing each otherrsquos clothes off, and making frenzied love on the chaise longue ndash but both being ldquointerested in their plates. If there was sexual innuendo here it bypassed me.How the Dickens did he and Ford even get published  If the publishersrsquo readers had turned to these crucial pages their manuscripts would have gone straight into the slush piles.The late Elmore Leonard, who knew a thing or two about filling the middle, often with corpses, was spot on when he advised writers to ldquoleave out the part readers want to skip.Itrsquos an ill windAre we over-reacting to this coronavirus thing  Football in Italy played behind closed doors, rugby cancelled, people locked up on a cruise ship so they can spread it to each other, widespread travel restrictions, compulsive hand-washing, face masks sold out, Channel rsquos Jon Snow, and hundreds of others self-isolating with only round-the-clock TV, constant attention and batches of baked beans and pemmican to keep them alive. Crivvens.This scare certainly feeds the media, although in kinder times the silly season used to be in the summer when the splash was about frying eggs on baking pavements. In a few years, with this global warming, wersquoll be doing that in December.Irsquom not undermining the potential seriousness but surely there needs to be a sense of perspective  At the time of writing just  in the UK have been diagnosed, none has died and nine have already been discharged. The worldwide death rate seems to be low, around %, which is obviously too many.But consider that in December last year eight people in England died in one week of flu and hundreds more were admitted to hospital. There were over  deaths here from flu last year and, in chilling contrast, in  there were over , in the UK. In the US in , there were  million cases, , people had to be hospitalised, and , people died from the flu. The World Health Organisation estimates that up to , people die from influenza each year.We already have a pandemic, it just isnrsquot as sexy.Viral greetingsIt has no doubt troubled you, in this age of the coronavirus, about the proper etiquette in greeting someone. You clearly canrsquot take the risk of shaking hands, rubbing noses or face masks, and certainly not kissing on the cheek. So what to do  A nod  A Japanese-style bow  Applaud, with newly-washed hands, like the Chinese  I think sticking out your tongue, as the Tibetans do, might send the wrong signal.You might put your palms together and bow, as in India, or put your right hand over your heart , common in the Middle East.

Itrsquos worked for me for years.Border madnessItrsquos not just a sense of perspective thatrsquos needed by US broadcaster CNN but geography. After the German health minister warned that his country was facing a coronavirus epidemic, CNN reported that ldquoGermany is not considering closing the countryrsquos borders with Italy due to the coronavirus outbreak. It would take a miracle, or an invasion, to do so, because Germany, as anyone who has cast even a brief glance at the globe will know, does not have a border with Italy.Seize the diseaseDid the US author Dean Koontz actually predict the coronavirus  years ago in his apocalypse novel The Eyes Of Darkness. No, itrsquos just a fortuitous marketing opportunity. In the book, the deadly virus ndash named Wuhan- ndash was man-ade in the Chinese city with % fatalities, unlike the present-day one. And in the original edition, published while the Cold War was still a reality, the virus was called Gorki-, after the the Russian city. When relations thawed China became the new enemy and the virus was renamed in subsequent editions.Steel-y indferenceI had a passing acquaintance with David Steel, Lord Steel of Aikwood as he became, a few years ago. It was around the time he was failing to do anything about the paedophile Cyril Smith. Steel was Liberal leader, later prominent in the LibDems, the present leadership of which appears to think that not just putting up with, but successfully championing a child abuser for a knighthood, as Steel did, is excusable. After being initially suspended from the party, Steel was ushered back in last year with the declaration that he had ldquoultimately nothing to answer.From Steel there has been not the whf of an apology to Smithrsquos victims, or over his failure to report the beast to the authorities. Indeed, hersquos cast himself as the victim. Hersquos said he will retire from the Lords shortly. Not that he will give up his title.

So should we follow suit  Should compulsory vaccination be the norm  The UK Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, has already said that hersquos ldquolooking very seriously at compulsory vaccination for school children.Figures show that childhood immunisation rates are dropping across Scotland, and the rest of the UK.The question about whether Britain should follow Germanyrsquos lead is timely ndash as the rapid spread of coronavirus underlines just how vulnerable society is to mass outbreaks in the era of globalisation.A coronavirus vaccine is still some way off, butone was developed tomorrow, there would be queues outside clinics across the country.Yet, at the same time, the so-called anti-vax movement is on the rise, as growing numbers of parents turn their back on the idea of immunising their children for fear of causing some greater harm, or because of religious beliefs.Many anti-vaxxers are convinced that they risk ldquogiving their child autismthey have them vaccinated. That belief, however, is scientic nonsense.Why Germany The decision was made in the midst of a global rise in measles cases. From today,a parent refuses to get their child immunised in Germany, theyrsquoll face a fine of around pound, and their child will be banned from nursery or school.The German law was passed after the nation listened to months of parliamentary debate, including testimony from medics who spoke both for and against compulsory vaccination.Germanyrsquos health minister described the move as both ldquochild protection and a bid to ensure that all members of society were protected. The World Health Organisation says % of any given population must be vaccinated to prevent mass outbreaks. Itrsquos called ldquoherd immunity.Measles is surging in Europe. In , there were , cases. By , that had risen to ,. In the first six months of , there were nearly , cases and  deaths. In the same period, there were  cases of measles in the UK ndash many linked to European travel.The moral dilemmaAt the heart of the issue of compulsory vaccination lie two huge moral questions. First, should any parent have the right to refuse vaccination and endanger the le of their child Second, does any parent have the right to put the rest of society at risk by refusing vaccination for their child If the answer to those questions is no, then the path starts to open up towards a policy of compulsory vaccination.The main parties in Germany ndash the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats ndash supported compulsory vaccination legislation. However, the Green Party offered an alternative.Greens were very critical of compulsion as a public health policy, and suggested instead a major education campaign. However, any attempt to raise ldquopublic awareness about the necessity of vaccination is an uphill struggle in the age of online conspiracy theories, which is where most anti-vax propaganda springs from.Theof measlesLast summer, WHO announced that measles had officially ed to four European nations previously deemed free of the disease ndash Britain, Albania, Greece, and the Czech Republic.The WHO announcement was made in the lead-up to Germany voting for compulsory vaccination. The loss of the UKrsquos measles-free status is surely a warning sign that something is going wrong when it comes to vaccination.Prior to widespread measles vaccination being introduced in the early s, the disease killed around . million people globally every year. By , measles was killing only , a year around the planet.Across the Western world measles is making a comeback. Even though the United States officially ldquoeliminated measles in , there were outbreaks across the country last year. Portland, Oregon, saw officials declare a public health emergency after one outbreak.In , there were  cases of measles in  states. The Centre for Disease Controlconfirmed this was ldquothe second-greatest number of annual cases reported since measles was eliminated.Most had not been vaccinated against measles. The CDC says US outbreaks are down to travellers bringing measles back from overseas, and the virus then finding a breeding ground among the unvaccinated.In some parts of America, such as Washington state, only % of children were fully vaccinated in  ndash although in other areas the rate is as low as %.In Washington, only % of children were exempt from vaccination on medical grounds ndash the rest refused vaccination because of their parentsrsquo religious or philosophical beliefs.WHO has described the anti-vax movement as among the  biggest global health threats. ldquoMeasles, for example, has seen a % increase in cases globally, WHO said.ldquoThe reasons for this rise are complex, and not all of these cases are due to vaccine hesitancy.ldquoHowever, some countries that were close to eliminating the disease have seen a resurgence.Global dimensionIn January , health officials blamed distrust of vaccine for an outbreak of measles among New Yorkrsquos Orthodox Jewish community. Some  people were infected after a child caught the disease.ldquoThe initial child with measles was unvaccinated and acquired measles on a visit to Israel, where a large outbreak of the disease is occurring, the New York City health department said.ldquoSince then, there have been additional children from Brooklyn who were unvaccinated and acquired measles while in Israel.Measles is still relatively common in Africa and Asia. Some  people brought measles back to America from other countries in .A study in the medical journal BMC Medicine, in May , into measles-immunisation policies in seven dferent healthcare systems, found that ldquorecent policies aimed at increasing childhood immunisation rates through the introduction of compulsory vaccination are certainly producing positive effects, by raising the proportion of children protected against measles.Publications by the British Medical Association have referred to the anti-vaccination movement as a ldquoneedless waste of le.Some % of the worldrsquos population thinks vaccines are dangerous. But in some Western countries ndash where online conspiracy theories prolerate most ndash opposition to vaccines is much higher.In France, one in three disagree when askedvaccines are safe. France has seen a % rise in the number of measles cases, from  in  to  in .Of the  people diagnosed with measles between April and June last year in England,  were aged  or over and had not been vaccinated.The  cases of measles represented a substantial increase in the rate of infection in just three months compared with January-April of the same year.Nearly half of those who contracted mumps in Britain were unvaccinated. Last year, between April and June, some , people were infected by mumps. The previous quarter saw just  people contract the illness. The , figure represents a -fold increase on the  diagnoses of mumps in the last three months of .ldquoThese stark rises in mumps and measles cases show that complacency about vaccines is misplaced and dangerous, said Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England. He has promised to ldquotackle the fake news peddled on social media.Lies, damned liesMuch of the anti-vax panic goes back to the discredited claims of medical doctor Andrew Wakefield. He claimed in The Lancet in  that the MMRvaccine was linked to autism. The General Medical Council later found that Wakefield had been dishonest in his research. The Lancet retracted the article. Wakefield was later struck off.The British Medical Journal described Wakefieldrsquos claims as ldquoan elaborate fraud. Wakefield was accused in reports of intending to financially profit from his bogus research. The scandal did little to silence Wakefield. He directed the documentary Vaxxed: From Cover-Up To Catastrophe in .Ian Lipkin, professor of epidemiology and director of the Centre for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University, compared the film to ldquoscience fiction, adding: ldquoAs a documentary it misrepresents what science knows about autism, undermines public confidence in the safety and efficacy of vaccines, and attacks the integrity of legitimate scientists and public health officials.The scientic evidence in favour of vaccination is insurmountable. Vaccines eradicated smallpox, which once killed one in seven children in Europe. Vaccines have also nearly wiped out polio. Estimates have been made thatevery child in the United States was given full vaccinations from birth to adolescence some , lives would be saved and  million infections prevented.However, Facebookrsquos use of micro-targeting algorithms allows anti-vaccine groups to aim adverts at the parents of young children, and undermine science. One fairly typical ad read: ldquoHealthy -week-old infant gets  vaccines and dies within  [hours].What history tells usWe just need to look back into the past to see how dangerous the anti-vax movement is ndash take Stockholm in . Religious objections led to an anti-vaccination campaign. This resulted in a drop in the take-up of vaccination in Stockholm to just over %, compared to around % in the rest of Sweden.A major smallpox epidemic broke out. That led to a rise in vaccine uptake, and the epidemic came to an end.In the UK in the s, questions were raised about the risks and effectiveness of the whooping cough vaccine. Vaccination dropped from % to %. The result was whooping cough epidemics and a number of deaths of children. Vaccine uptake then increased to above % and the disease declined dramatically.After the MMR controversy, there was a measles outbreak in Ireland. Immunisation levels had fallen to below % nationally. In some parts of Dublin the uptake was as low as %. There were more than  cases and three children died.In Wales in , there was an outbreak of measles in Swansea. Some , were infected, one died. In , the uptake of MMR in Wales was %. In Swansea by , however, in the wake of the MMR panic, uptake was as low as .%.Whatrsquos to be doneAustralia tackled the anti-vax movement by introducing ldquono jab, no pay and ldquono jab, no play. This withholds state payments like child care benefit, child care rebate and family Tax benefit for parents who have children not fully immunised. It also penalises childcare centres which admit non-vaccinated children.ldquoNo jab, no pay was introduced in . By July , , children who had not been previously fully immunised were vaccinated.Many people understandably feel uncomfortable with this level of parental coercion. The British Society for Immunologyrsquos chief executive, Dr Doug Brown, favours public information campaigns.ldquoTo make this compulsory in the UK, there are concerns that it could increase current health inequalities and alienate parents with questions on vaccination, he said.ldquoThere are also major doubts about how such a policy could be implemented and monitored and risks resulting in unintended consequences as well as a loss of public confidence in vaccines.Shirley Cramer, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health, says: ldquoCompulsory vaccination should be a last resort.The politicsAside from the politically problematic fact that health is a devolved matter, therersquos one issue which complicates the idea of compulsory vaccination across the UK ndash regional disparity.In Scotland and Northern Ireland the take-up rate for MMR is %. Although that figure is high for Scotland, overall vaccination rates are still dropping here. In northeast England the take-up rate is .%, but in London it is just %.On such a small group of islands, compulsory vaccination would be rendered ineffective without all four UK nations taking part. But why should Scotland and Northern Ireland ndash which have herd immunity ndash consider compulsory vaccination when the issue is primarily a problem where Public opinion will be the big test. In the age of coronavirus do we have the tolerance, as a nation, for those of us who would put others, as well as themselves and their own children, at risk when it comes to health What we know for sure is that the German experience of compulsory vaccination which begins today will be watched closely by politicians and health professionals around the world.The rise in measles cases, coming at a when the world is focused on coronavirus, may create a tipping point where the public feels health outweighs parental liberty. We can already see how little opposition there is in the West to health-enforcement measures such as quarantine in the face of coronavirus.We should also remember that Britain has made vaccination compulsory in the past. In , the Vaccination Act required that all children be vaccinated against smallpox. Refusal resulted in a pound fine ndash a lot of money in Victorian times. Mandatory vaccination only came to an end in  ... once smallpox was deemed effectively eradicated in Britain, and public health secure."},{"url":null,"title":"auld gits donation boost for foodbank","story":"A local society has presented Inverurie Foodbank with a cash donation after holding two recent fundraising events.The Auld Golfers of Inverurie Travelling Societyhanded over their donation of £, to the foodbank on Saturday, February .The Auld-GITS held a whisky tasting event and Golf Extravaganza and raised the money thanks to sales of raffles, auctions and bingo.Member Mark Jubb said: “Each year we pick a deserving local charity to donate money to.“Last year it was Gordon Dementia and this year we decided to choose the foodbank.“This money will be a great help for the foodbank and we hope they can continue the fantastic work that they do.”Val Shinnie, co-ordinator for Inverurie Foodbank, thanked the Auld-GITS and said the donation was “much appreciated”.She added: “The money will go into the Aberdeenshire North Foodbank pot and we will use it across the area when we need it.“We have wish lists at our local supermarkets soanyone would like to help us out please go along and see what we need.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Project Director Calum MacLean and Technical Director Matt Lewin\"  Kintore firm invests in new appointments viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"eco emergency event to be held in inverurie","story":"A one-day conference which will examine some of the most crucial issues affecting the environment and what can be done to address them will be held in Inverurie next month.The Eco Emergency Event, organised by Garioch Women for Change, will cover a wide range of topics in  dferent seminars throughout the day delivered by speakers from across Scotland, many of whom are taking innovative approaches in the battle against climate change.They include Jane Morrison, Executive Officer at the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , who was named one of Scotland’s  Inspiring Women under  in .

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

In early , they decided to have insulation work carried out in their home following a cold call by Mark Crilly. that Mr Crilly, a former footballer who played for the likes of Ayr United, St Mirren, and Raith Rovers, came to their bungalow in July  and offered to carry out ious jobs as part of a grant scheme. Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits. Mrs Child claims that after initially stating that he was working under one of the warm home schemes, prior to the work being carried Mr Crilly said he now had his own company – the Central Heating Team.

She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before.

There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business. There is no money in the bank to repairwhat he has done.” contacted Mr Crilly for comment, but we have not received a response."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/001WH2102NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week service users at Tigh na Drochaid Resource Centre in Portree produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

He works extensively at Westminster, Dublin and Stormont.In the late s, he was music critic for the News Letter and contributed to the New Musical Express.He says he uses music to escape from the pain of supporting Everton, Cltonville and Ballymena Rugby Club, not to mention the politics.And he equivocates excellently in true political fashion over his choices - and how they could all change overnight!He says: “The problem with picking a Top Ten is my taste can change from time to time. So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

My love of music comes from sitting in the back bedroom of the house listening to my parentsrecord collection, Jim Reeves, The Platters, Bobby Darrin and Ray Charles amongst others.My sister Patricia and I would also try and listen to Radio Luxemburg and Radio when we were not be asked to turn it down!For many years I was a DJ in the town, mobile at the start but ended up working in clubs, got to perform in Burberrys, Kelly’s amongst others, but ended up in Tullyglass- Maxwells Plum!For the last  years of that type of work, stopped when I was  as I just didn’t want to play the dance music they wanted me too!I used to promote bands in the George and McKendry’s, best bands at that time on the local circuit where, Ghost of an American Airman, Carpenter Joe, Violet Sky and the famous Blues Brothers nights with Otis and the Elevators, great days indeed.I suppose my lasting mark will be as a founder member of Radio Cracker in Ballymena, along with Andy Thompson, Ernie Kilpatrick and many others So, here’s my Top  in no particular order –. Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace. The Undertones – You’ve got my number , I could be spotted from an early age jumping up and down on a dance floorafter forcing a DJto play it!

And they are calling themselves the Upper Bann congregation of RPCIto dferentiate themselves from the main church, which has around  congregations in the province. Mr Dunlop confirmed that they had broken away from the RPCI over the analysis of ‘sin’ during a sermon at Loughbrickland, and the issue was raised with the sessionat the church. Mr Dunlop was one of four elders, and the minister is Rev David Silversides.He added he was not prepared to go into details, as the matter could have legal implications. But the Upper Bann website claims, “The matter spiralled out of control, when Biblical and church procedures were ignored. Spurious ‘discipline’ was enacted against a number of members and it was impossible for some to continue.” The upshot was that Mr Dunlop was excommunicated. He and another elder moved out, with  members, “for the sake of the peace of the Loughbrickland congregation”. The website adds, “As it is an ongoing controversy, still before the ecclesiastical courts – elements of which my come before the civil courts – we refrain from presenting details at present.” The website claims that members excluded from Loughbrickland were denied “constitutional redress within the RPCI”, and they decided to move to Portadown, and set up the first Covenanters Church in the town.The Watson Centre was available and they moved in earlier this month, with ‘Upper Bann Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland ’ sign on the gable wall. Rev David Silversides, who has been minister at Loughbrickland for around  years, confirmed that Mr Dunlop had been excommunicated by the church. He added, “It was a long-drawn-out situation, but I don’t want to comment any further.” He referred to the RPCI’s main ruling body – the Synod – where the clerk, Rev Edward McCollum of Ballymoney, also confirmed the excommunication. “It’s is a dficult situation and I cannot see a resolution,” he added. Mr Dunlop said the Relief group was in Portadown for the long haul and had a viable congregation of people in the wider Upper Bann area who were committed to the new church. “We are becoming well established,” he added.

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row. Maximum Respect. Meas Mór.Both those who attended and those who followed the live broadcast on TG were, indeed, “immeasurably enriched” by the Gradam Ceoil Awards, as the VIP who opened the Waterfront Hall had predicted.And who was he Prince Charles, of course.You can watch back at Gradam Ceoil on the TG player at www.tg.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"if you want to get ahead get a hat","story":"I LIKE hats. And caps. I have quite a nice collection of headwear, worn and aged, like myself, dispersed between Dublin and Belfast, Donegal, the car boot and all the places in between. It used to be customary for men to wear headware. Look at any old photos. Dunchers and flatcaps galore. Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they just cant get enough of shirley","story":"PATHOS, poignancy, hilarity and a fortnight in Greece will collide once again as Tara Lynne O’Neill revives her Shirley Valentine on the Lyric stage this month.Before the initial Shirley run back in September, she had been approached to play one of Willy Russell’s most iconic creations by Lyric Executive Producer Jimmy Fay, a part, at the time, she had no hesitation in accepting., words of script later, Tara Lynne, along with director Patrick J O’Reilly, is preparing to bring the housewe back along with a lot of “sun shimmer” for a limited run at the end of this month.When we meet, Tara has just ed from Dublin where she was reading for Embrace a Giant Spirit, a Seamus Heaney showcase in Christ Church were she read his poem, Markings. In between dodging the last remnants of Storm Ciara, the former St Genevieve’s High School pupil and Derry Girls actress is warm, funny and straight talking about how her version of Willy Russell’s creation is “very much of this particular period in time”.She said: “Audiences have come with their friends, then they’ve come again and brought their mums, mother-in-laws, it’s phenomenal. Audiences feel like Shirley and it’s a gt that they want to give to other people. With the character of Shirley, I suppose it’s that thing that people always talk about, about being a ‘strong female lead’. Well, what is a strong female lead  To me, a strong female lead is someone who is flawed, they show their flaws. Shirley is just every woman and that is what is beautul about her. The character of Shirley has so many dilemmas that every woman faces, no matter what we are.“In the play Shirley talks about being back in school, she believed that good things were not meant for her.“A lot of us come out of school feeling like that or afraid to try stuff because we are afraid to fail.“I’ve been asked to contribute to a piece ITV are doing for International Women’s Day in March – what would you say to your younger self  The only thing I would say to my younger self is to try stuff, fail,you fail what is the worst that can happen  You get back up and you do it again, you do it better. This industry is constantly trying, but you can also play it safe. Shirley has been afraid to make mistakes her whole le. She’s got the . children, the nice house, it’s spotless, the husband, Joe, he’s out working, there isn’t much more she can do. It’s basically a question then of, ‘Is this it ’“Yes, Shirley is  and when I say that on stage people laugh because today, in , it’s so young. But actually  years ago  seemed older, people acted and carried themselves older. I’m  and I go, ‘Well, I’m young.’ We’ve come a long way, I think.”During the production’s initial run, Tara Lynne spoke of how, post-show, she had some “brilliant, absolutely incredible conversations” with women and men of all ages.“I had women in their s want to talk about the play, sixth form students talk to me about how they related to it.”Tara Lynne said that the revival of the play is also a fitting tribute to her friend and assistant director, Julie Maxwell, who tragically passed away last August during a night out in the city centre.“I know we all will truly miss her, I truly miss Julie, I have all the notes that she gave me during our first run of rehearsals. I feel that the success of the show and its second staging is a good way to honour her.”When the curtain comes down on this run, Tara Lynne will be preparing to start filming for the juggernaut that is Channel Four’s smash hit Derry Girls. Playing Ma Mary, the matriarch of the Quinn McCool clan, Tara Lynne has gained something of a cult following with her s perm, jumpers and ‘punt purse’ throughout the show’s two series.“We will hopefully be getting the script soon and I’ve no idea what is in them yet. We will be filming May through to July and I can’t wait to see everybody and the third series will be out later in the year. I’ve also written a play for the Belfast Festival later in the year so it’s very much a case of watch this space.”•Shirley Valentine willto the Lyric Theatre from February  until March .

The combination of a growing younger population, gently rising property prices, and some of the lowest housing costs in Ireland or Britain means that Belfast is a hub of activity for younger people in the property market.In order to gain a greater insight into the experience of these first-time buyers in the local property market, the ATN spoke to two young couples that recently bought their first homes in Belfast as well as real estate expert Colin Moran of Property People. Our goal was to investigate what motivates young people out of the rental market towards purchasing, as well as the factors involved in choosing their first property.Fionntan Smithof Ladybrook, and his fiancée Ciararecently purchased their first home, a semi-detached four-bedroom house with a back garden, in Gransha, in the heart of Andersonstown. They said their purchase was a reflection of their two main priorities: an advantageous location and the space to start a family.“Before we purchased we were both living at home with our parents and saving money: we weren’t keen on getting into the rental market and always having that insecurity over your head,” Fionntan said.“Once we knew we wanted to start a family together we looked at a number of locations and homes. I suppose we could have looked at something cheaper down the road, or a more modern home further out in the ‘commuter ring’, but we decided that our priority was the advantages of living in such an older, settled, well-established area like Gransha.“There’s barely any crime here and being in the middle of West Belfast gives you’re the proximity to the city centre, pubs, public transport, the shops. At the same time, we have plenty of rooms and we have a big back garden, which allows us to raise a family.”Chris Campbell-Palmerand his partner Yvonneon the other hand, decided to purchase their first property – a three-bedroom terraced house – just off the Ravenhill Road in Southeast Belfast after eight years of co-habiting in rented accommodation.“We took the step of getting our first home because ultimately we were sick of moving so often, sometimes due to poorly-maintained properties and disputes with landlords,” they told the ATN.“Financially at the end of the day it is more expensive to rent and that isn’t sustainable. We looked at flats first but there’s a real lack of affordable apartments in Belfast, so that’s when we expanded outwards to look at houses in South and East Belfast, where prices are affordable for first-time buyers.“Even though it’s an older property which needs a bit of work, the house we settled on has more space than a typical terraced house, so we can have friends visit or maintain a lodger. Eventhe area is new to us it’s only a mile walk to the Ormeau Road where most of our friends are as well as being close to the city centre for work.”Director of Property People, Colin Moran, concurred with both couples’ choice to move out of the rental market and into owning their homes.“Purchase every time would be my advice. Despite the flexibility of renting, is in my opinion not a good long-term housing option,” he said.“Owning your property gives you much more stability over the future of your home and an asset that can be sold or passed on to future generations. As far as location and the features of the home you settle on, buying a property is very exciting and provides the buyer the ability to choose their home to reflect their personality, le choices, and future. For dferent people that will mean dferent things but the priority is to make sure your home fits your le as it is much more than just the building itself but how it can enhance your le.“In terms of professional advice, I would urge people to get on the property ladder at an affordable entry point, and aim for a % deposit as you have plenty of time to pay it off,” he added.“In terms of an investment, a good investment property is in a location that will be desirable for tenants to ensure occupancy, be of a good standard or at price that reflects any refurbishments. The numbers have to work in terms of rental yield as well, and that is key to bear in mind and somewhere were buyers should seek advice from an expert.”"},{"url":null,"title":"alliance proposal to stop flying union flag year round defeated","story":"The Union flag flies over Ards Council offices.Photo by Peter Morrison FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe Union flag flies over Ards Council offices.Photo by Peter MorrisonBy Michael KenwoodFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailAn Alliance proposal to stop the Union flag flying all year round at sites in Ards and North Down has been defeated.Flags policy in the area was due for renewal after the borough#s equality scheme#s five-year run ended this month.

Observe good hand and general hygiene - thorough hand-washing with soap or sanitisers and disposal of tissues.The guidelines add that service-goers should stay at homethey feel ill and display influenza-like symptoms, and to not come to services until they feel well.The Presbyterian Church has said they are asking congregations to adhere to PHA guidance but have not introduced any changes to services.Archbishop Eamon Martin wrote to all priests recently advising them to prepare for the celebration of Mass in the context of the flu season but a spokesman said it will be guided by the PHA, North and South about coronavirus.Chairman of the British Medical Association in Northern Ireland Dr Tom Black said avoiding direct contact is the best way to minimise the chances of transferring the virus and shaking hands should be avoided.He added: We are still in the containment phase where we want to limit the spread of this, where we want to isolate the case and where we want to contact, trace and quarantine casesnecessary, which is what you do in this phase of the disease to make sure it is not spread too rapidly.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadPaddy Jackson#s lawyers threaten to sue Rory BestBelfast woman jailed after causing #catastrophic and lelong injuries# to schoolboy she knocked down in Audi TTFirst Northern Ireland coronavirus case confirmed as #drive-through# test centre set up at Antrim hospital UVF victim Ian Ogle#s daughter turns to McCartney family in her bid for justiceAlliance proposal to stop flying union flag year round defeated ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Rachel FarrellFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe first case of coronavirus has been confirmed in the Republic of Ireland.The Health Protection Surveillance Centre was informed of the confirmed case of Covid- on Saturday.The patient, a male in the eastern part of the country, is currently receiving appropriate medical care.The case is associated with travel from an affected area in northern Italy, rather than contact with another confirmed case in Northern Ireland.Anyone that has been in contact with the patient has already been informed by health officials.Dr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer with the Department of Health, said: “This is not unexpected. We have been preparing for this eventuality for many weeks now.“Public health protocols have been in place since January and are operating effectively.“The health service is well used to managing infectious diseases and has robust response measures in place.”Stormont Health Minister Robin Swann said: “We will continue to co-operate on contact tracing and other vital steps as we work relentlessly to mitigate the spread of COViD . “Earlier today, the First Minister, deputy First Minister, Taoiseach, Minister Harris and myself spoke together by teleconference.

Since launching in Belfast in , Co-Founders has delivered four cohorts involving  people who formed more than  teams - over  of whom are still working together. Twenty teams have received Proof of Concept funding, and eight teams have progressed to the full-time Propel pre-accelerator programme.Co-Founders has attracted software engineers, data scientists, sales and marketing experts, medical professionals, mechanical engineers, researchers, undergraduates and PhDs as well as people who have experienced a problem in a certain industry or from everyday le and want to develop a product to solve it.Participants in the new North West programme will have the added incentive of being in the running to win one of five pound, proof of concept grants from Innovate UK, the government’s innovation agency, which will be awarded to five teams with the best developed ideas at the end of the programme.Sonya Kerr, programme manager of Co-Founders, said Catalyst was hoping to attract  to  people from Derry, Letterkenny and across the North West to sign up.“We know there is a wealth of talent in the North West and a lot of people who have great ideas or are restless to try something new, who will really benefit from meeting others with dferent skills needed to build a start-up that they wouldn’t normally have a chance to meet,” she said.“Teams on Co-Founders are willing to try something dferent, meet new people and stretch themselves. We certainly don’t expect everyone to leave their jobs immediately and create a start-up but by helping people validate their ideas and build teams, it becomes a real option for many.”For example, of the nine teams who completed Catalyst’s first Co-Founders programme, three are still together and two have received over pound, in funding to build and launch their products.While on the programme, Co-Founder teams get access to co-working space within Catalyst to allow them to grow their own networks.Applications are now open for the programme at: co-founders.coThe deadline for applications for the North West programme is March . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sister Clare Crockett was a self-confessed party girl with a promising showbusiness career in front of her but she turned her back on fame to follow God when she joined the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother at just . Since her tragic death at just , many miracles have been attributed to her intercession. Clare grew up in Derrys Brandywell and was a popular and outgoing girl who and dreamed of being famous. googletag.cmd.push By her late teens, she had secured an agent and was on the verge a successful acting career, but like many girls her age she spent her weekends drinking in pubs and clubs. She wasnt a bit religious growing up, her sister, Shauna Gill, remembered. We used to dob mass and Clare and my sister, Megan, would go and buy fags and theyd buy me a Taz bar to shut my mouth, she smiled. Clare made her acting debut in Sunday Paul Greengrasss film about Bloody Sunday. She had also landed a gig presenting a youth show on Channel  and had been approached by Nickelodeon about further presenting roles. googletag.cmd.push In the year , Clares friend had to drop out of a trip to Spain and she was asked to go in her place. It was only after her name was on the ticket that Clare realised it was a Retreat, organised by the religious order the Home of the Mother. She thought she was going to Ibiza for a free trip away, laughed Shauna. Clare would later describe how she spent the first few days of the trip smoking and sunbathing, but on Good Friday she experienced something that was to change her le. The group attended a Good Friday service and the congregation were asked to kiss the Crucix. When Clares turn came, she had an overwhelming feeling that Jesus loved her and had died for her. She later told people that her sins had nailed him to the cross. She kissed the cross and it was her le. That was it, said Shauna. Clare ed to Derry as a very dferent girl, but it took her another year to answer Gods call to become a nun. She tried to fight it, said Shauna. If our father was giving her a lt to the Bound for Boston bar she would say dont drive past the Long Tower chapel because God used to stand at the gate calling to her. On one of her many nights out Clare had too much to drink and went into a toilet cubicle to be sick. She had a strong sense that someone was watching her and then heard Gods voice in her head saying why do you keep hurting me  Clare said she felt that she was nailing Jesus to the cross once again, and in that moment she decided she should devote her le to him.  She told her family she was moving to Spain to be a nun with the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother who she had met on the Retreat. We were shocked, admitted Shauna. She was the most dramatic, outgoing person you could ever meet in your le. I think the priests thought she was a big eejit at the start. But Clare had always been her own person and was determined not to let anything stand in her way. She didnt care what anyone  said, Shauna recalled. She had never cared what anyone thought of her. She used to wear horrible clothes, well to me they were horrible. Clare was stunning, but she didnt care what she looked like. She would just run her fingers through her hair and go out the door. Heartbroken at their daughters decision to start a new le so far from home, the Crocketts hoped she would be back after a few weeks, but Clare surprised everybody by fully embracing her new way of le. That was her le and there was no talking to her, said Shauna. We still sit and say did that really happen, did she really go away and become a nun  but she was so happy and she never complained. She made a dference to so many peoples lives. Clares determination to become a nun never wavered. She later said God told her I will be your mother, your father, your language, your country. After taking her first vows on February ,  she took the religious name Sister Clare Maria of the Trinity and the Heart of Mary. She went on to take her perpetual vows on September ,  and served the Servant Sisters of the House of the Mother in Belmonte and Valencia in Spain, Jacksonville in America and Guayaquil and Playa Prieta in Ecuador. Clares magnetic personality and gt for music and song helped her connect with people and she had a special affinity with children. Carmelite priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, who celebrates a Mass in memory of Sister Clare every month, said her extraordinary story blew him away. He first heard about Sr Clares story when he watched All or Nothing:Sr Clare Crockett the film made by the House Of The Mother Order about her le. The film shows footage of Clare during her  years with the Order and charts her le from her first Retreat until just days before her death. To witness someone of little or no faith experience Christ in such a radical way and who lived her le in such a radical way is amazing. She fitted more into her  years than most of us ever will. Its not just the attributed miracles. You have to look at who this girl was and the le she came from and how she became a nun. When you see nuns these days they are old women in their s and s, but this is a girl who gave her whole le to God and that is the greatest miracle of all. Towards the end of her le Clare started suffering from severe migraines that made her physically sick. It emerged after her death she was suffering from a bleed to her brain, but she had continued to work as hard as ever telling her Sisters that she wrote a blank cheque to God every day. Every time you saw her she had a guitar in her hand and she was singing and she had a whole tribe of wains behind her, Shauna recalled. Just days before she passed away Sister Clare told her fellow nuns that she knew she was going to die young and even suggested she might die at  like Jesus had. On April , , Sister Clare was crushed to death in the stairwell of her school in Playa Prieta in Ecuador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake. She was -years-old. When her body was discovered she was carrying a piece of her guitar in her hand.  Her mum, Margaret, who passed away on lSeptember  last year at  from vascular dementia, never got over her daughters death. She cried a wile lot, said Shauna. Shed say why did our Clare leave me  but shes doing more now that she has died than she could ever have done alive. It makes the grieving easier. She is doing so much for people. After Clare died she was brought back to Derry and laid to rest at the City Cemetery where her grave has become a place of pilgrimage for visitors from around the world. We were overwhelmed, said Shauna. Shes just not another person who died, people have kept her legacy and her name going. Theres a wee man who comes from Toome every fortnight with flowers from Marks  Spencer and goes to her grave. Thats her effect everywhere you go. People are just devoted to her. A prayer group which asks Sister Clare to intercede for them meets weekly in Derry. We have a packed room every time and people get a great feeling, said Shauna. Several miracles have been attributed to Sister Clare, including the birth of twins to an infertile couple and the recovery of a young boy on le support whose parents had been told he would die. So what would Sister Clare make of calls for her to be made a saint  She would love it, smiled Shauna. She went from only ever wanting to be famous and live a le of luxury to giving everything up. But she made the right choice. She said Im going to be famous. Im going to be a famous nun. The Mass in memory of Sister Clare takes place on the second Sunday of every month in Termonbacca at pm.Her anniversary Mass will take place on Sunday, April , in Termonbacca. The Sister Clare Novena prayer group meets every Monday at the Search youth group premises in the Iona Business Parkat .pm.

Sixty minutes. Once the sliotar is thrown in, a game evaporates in a flash. Yet so much can happen. The helter-skelter of championship does that. For the camogs of Slaughtneil, they are just  minutes away from the upper echelons of club camogie. A passport to the very top of the tree. A fourth successive All-Ireland title would equal Buffers Alleys feat of the s. The Wexford club won the  title before losing the decider to Corks Killeagh the following but bounced back to annex the next four titles. googletag.cmd.push A Slaughtneil win on Sunday would also see them join Corks Glen Rovers on the roll of honour, who have four titles to their name, on the roll of honour. Standing in their way are Michael Hopper McGraths Sarsfields. The former All-Ireland winning forwards team, - which includes four of his daughters – must be sick of the sight of the Emmets at this stage. In Slaughtneils breakthrough year, Eiliacutes Niacute Chaisides player of the match performance saw her curl over the insurance point and supply the ammunition for Mary Kellys early second half goal to sink Sarsfields. The following year, snow stalled the road to glory and by time the game was fixed for Clones, Sarsfields had no answer to new attacking ace Tina Bradley, who rattled up a - tally, powering Slaughtneil to glory again. googletag.cmd.push Last year the landscape changed in the form of a new challenger emerging from the west. It was Ardrahan who took Sarsfields crown but they were edged out by the Derry giants, who defeated Mags DArcys St Martins in a Croker snowstorm to complete three-in-row. Slaughtneils four-year unbeaten run came a cropper in the league last summer at the hands of neighbours Swatragh at Davitt Park. By the time the championship rolled into town, normal service resumed. After a semi-final win over the Davitts, they slugged it out with Ballinascreen before retaining their title. From their first All-Ireland winning team of , five players have moved on. Denise McGuigan retired with two All-Ireland medals in her collection. Her cousin Dervlagh had the sameby the time she jetted off for a teaching career in Dubai. Mary Kelly moved to Glasgow after the first title, also to start a new job. This season, manager Damien McEldowney had to plan without defensive duo, sisters Eiliacutes and Broacutena Niacute Chaiside who opted to go travelling. Into the defence came Eiliacutes McGrath to cement a place and there was afor Clare McGrath, who missed out of the  after having a baby.    players in line for a fourth All-Ireland final starting berth:Jolene BradleyJosine McMullanGraacuteinne Niacute ChathaacuteinAoe Niacute ChaisideTherese MellonSinead MellonLouise DouganSiobhaacuten BradleyShannon Graham.  After a season at midfield, Faoiltiarna Burke opted out of the  and Cliona Mulholland has slotted into the vacancy. Mary Kellys shoes were filled by Tina Bradley. Josine McMullan had originally moved from corner back but was converted into a ball winner at full-forward. She lost her place for the Loughgiel game to Olivia Rafferty before a recall for the All-Ireland semi-final. If McEldowney and his selectors retain the same starting line-up, it will see nine players start all four All-Ireland finals. Slaughtneil and their highly-respected physio Moira-Jane Devlin will have been thankful of the five week play-off since their win over Scarf-Ogonnelloe. Shannon Graham was forced off with an ankle ligament injury, but manager Damien McEldowney is confident she will be available for selection. CHANGES As the Emmets peek out west, there are changes in the Sarsfields camp from the previous encounters. Yvonne Lyons has been replaced by current Galway club all-star keeper Laura Glynn between the posts. Sinead Cannon has moved from attack to corner back in place of cruciate ligament victim Rachel Murphy. In the other corner is former midfielder Kate Gallagher. There have been changes to their half-back unit. Erica Leslie picked up a hip injury that kept her out of the - to - county final win over St Thomas. She ed for the All-Ireland semi-final. So too did Maria Cooney. She had her foot in a cast for six weeks following a broken ankle sustained in the second half of their win over St Thomas. Tara Kenny tore her cruciate ligament before Galways All-Ireland final win over Kilkenny in September. Sarsfields only starter on the winning side was Sarah Spellman and she wasnt without injuries woes, having to get over a broken thumb to play her part in their - to - victory over St Vincents. The five-week break will have given Leslie, Cooney and Spellman every chance of making full recoveries, which will be a welcome boost as Hopper ponders who picks up Tina Bradley. His daughters Clodagh and Niamh – who picked up a hamstring injury in the  final – line out in the midfield zone, with Orlaith and Siobhaacuten forming the spine of their attack. There has been an injection of youth to their squad. Rachel Murray, who played Sarsfields last All-Ireland final appearance, Cora Kenny who was on water bottle duties in Clones that day and Joanne Daly were all part of last years Galway minor team. Another newcomer is Aoibhe Deeley who has mixed underage camogie with a career in athletics, where she specialises in the hurdles. Slaughtneils defence will be thoroughly tested. Graacuteinne Niacute Chathaacutein will be the favourite to pick up Siobhaacuten McGrath. Ceacuteat McEldowney could go onto Rachel Murray, with Eiliacutes McGrath assigned to Cora Kenny, who scored the match-winning goal in their extra-time win over Mullagh in the Galway semi-final. It is in the midfield area where the game will hinge. Slaughtneil had a tough physical battle with Scarf-Ogonnelloe, like they did with Thomastown in . Back then, it served them well. Clare McGrath, Bridiacuten McAllister and Aoe Niacute Chaiside will have a huge to roll to play across the half-back line, with Shannon Graham getting back to full power after injury. They also have their quarter-back, Louise Dougan back in the sweeping role but in her absence from attack puts a huge emphasis on the movement of Therese and Sinead Mellon to provide the link in the half-forward ision. Eight-time winners St Pauls Kilkenny , St Lachtains Kilkenny and Pearses Galway accompany Slaughtneil in the three-in-row club. The Emmets have made a habit of breaking records and who would bet against the Bill and Agnes Carroll Cup making another foray up the Halfgain Road on Sunday night. VERDICT: SLAUGHTNEIL PROBABLE TEAMS SLAUGHTNEIL: Jolene Bradley Ceacuteat McEldowney, Graacuteinne Niacute Chathaacutein, Eiliacutes McGrath Bridiacuten McAllister, Aoe Niacute Chaiside, Clare McGrath Shannon Graham, Cliona Mulholland, Siobhaacuten Bradley, Tina Bradley, Louise Dougan, Josie McMullan, Sinead Mellon, Therese Mellon. SARSFIELDS: Laura Glynn, Sinead Cannon, Laura Ward, Kate Gallagher, Erica Leslie, Maria Cooney, Joanne Daly, Aoibhe Deeley, Niamh McGrath, Clodagh McGrath, Orlaith McGrath, Sarah Spellman, Cora Kenny, Siobhaacuten McGrath, Rachel Murray. KEY BATTLE Siobhaacuten McGrath v Graacuteinne Niacute ChathaacuteinIn Sarsfields last three championship games, Siobhaacuten McGrath has amassed - of her teams combined tally of -. While man come from placed balls, it is her all round play that makes her the pivot of their All-Ireland challenger. Graacuteinne Niacute Chathaacutein will need the help of her midfield to limit the supply butshe can at least break even in her duel with McGrath, it could tip the scales in Slaughtneils favour.

Ryan McGeough was coached by Gregg at Portstewart FC for three or four years as a teenager. “My mum texted me about his death and I couldnt believe it,” McGeough said. “I hadnt seen him in a few years and I would have loved to run into him and have a yarn but unfortunately I never got the chance.” Gregg, who was voted as the best goalkeeper of the  World Cup, a native of Tobermore, passed away at the age of  and aside from his talents between the posts he was most famous in football circles for his heroics during the Munich air disaster in February  which claimed the lives of  people. googletag.cmd.push Harry pulled some of his team-mates from the burning plane, after disaster struck on theirjourney from a European Cup victory over Red Star Belgrade. Among those he saved were Bobby Charlton, Jackie Blanchflower and manager Sir Matt Busby. Harry played  games but was a larger than le presence. Anybody who ever had a conversation with Harry would have remembered it,” stated Irish FA Chief Executive Patrick Nelson in a statement to the County Derry Post. Gregg started his club career with Windsor Park Swts, the reserve team of Linfield, before signing for his local club Coleraine. At the age of  he earned a move to Second Division side Doncaster Rovers before switching to Manchester United for pound,, which was a world record fee for a goalkeeper at the time and made  appearances for the Red Devils. googletag.cmd.push He entered management and became manager of Shrewsbury Town, before taking charge of Swansea City, Crewe Alexandra and Carlisle United. Gregg also had a spell as goalkeeping coach at Manchester United and as assistant manager at Swindon Town. Harry was appointed an MBE by The Queen in  for services to football, and was then made an OBE in , also for services to football. Each week the Harry Gregg Foundation facilitates a wide range of activities for thousands of people in the Coleraine area and beyond through participation in football and ious other activities. Sir Alex Ferguson, who took his United team to play in Harrys testimonial in Belfast in , paid a tribute on Manchester Uniteds Official Website. “Harry was a man of great character and a true legend at our club. I remember that he was always very excited and proud to host our youth team at his boarding house for the Milk Cup every summer, so he could recount the tales of his playing days. I loved his company and the many pieces of advice he gave me.” While back in Ireland, Gregg bought the Windsor Hotel in Portstewart and began coaching the local soccer team. One player who remembers him fondly was goalkeeper Ryan McGeough who would go on to win two Derry championship medals with Coleraine GAA team. GREGG THE COACH “He was thecoach but as a goalkeeper you got a lot more attention from him than everybody. He was the first goalkeeper coach I ever came across that made the goalkeepers train with the outfielders. “Ray Woods was an England capped goalkeeper whenUnited won the league in   and they bought Harry for a record fee. “Harry said to me the only reason why they bought him was that Woods was a linie,” recalls McGeough, referring to Woods reluctance to leave his six-yard box. “Harry was the first goalkeeper to sweep outside his box and cover for defenders. He would always have had you out in the box organising your defenders.” McGeough soon learned Greggs approach to goalkeeping during one of those coaching sessions with Portstewart. “Peter Schmeichel was my hero and having played European handball, he brought in the spreading himself”, McGeough continues, explaining the Danes trademark star-jump, making himself as imposing as possible. Harry Gregg didnt agree and stopped his young proteacutegeacute advancing a la Schmeichel during training.   It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. Ryan McGeough  “He dropped the ball and said you, e on it and you , challenge him. If you do the spread again, you will do this all night. In Harrys era, you ed and took the ball and man. “It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. I havent spread myself since in case Harry was watching,” laughs the affable McGeough. “He would have taken it as serious coaching a  year old as a senior.” “He taught you how to manipulate forwards on a one on one and force the forward to make the first move. What he was teaching was far and beyond seen before. “If another manager, who is not a goalkeeper, says something to you, you could question it butHarry said something to you - you just did it. “Wed sit around the changing room listening to him for an hour and a half after training. Hed be telling us stories about Best, Charlton and Busby. When you are a big Man Utd head, you are in dreamland listening to him.” McGeough speaks of how goalkeeping has changed and in the era of televised games too much of the routines being similar. “In Harrys day there were so many dferent styles and I would prefer to play the way Harry played.” READ ALSO - He was larger than le on the pitch.

However, McKnight was not to be denied and in the seventh minute he dispossessed Corey Laverty and hit a shot that squirmed through Leneghanrsquos hands and into the net.Albion had barely time to celebrate as, virtually from the restart, Tollymore won a free kick that was delivered into the box, by McLister, for Ruairi Toner to shoot into the net.United slowly began to take a stranglehold in midfield with Marty McCourt and Tommy Kane dominating Burke and Rooney. On the left wing, Marty Devlin was giving the Albion defence a torrid time with his pace and power.Just on the stroke of half-time Albionrsquos Ryan Beckett fired a free kick over the Bearsrsquo crossbar.Despite having wind advantage, Tollymore were unable to create any chances of note and they were rocked in the th minute when Albion centre half Allan Cousins found himself unmarked in the Tollymore area to head a corner kick past Leneghan.Despite this setback, Tollymore held their nerve and Jack McCourt and Matt McCormick linked up for McCourt to run through on goal. Unfortunately, Albion lsquokeeper Joel Collins made a superb finger tip save to block McCourtrsquos shot.United were well on top, but were lacking the guile to open up the Moira defence until the introduction of veteran striker Adrian lsquoSparkyrsquo Howard.Within moments of Howardrsquos arrival in the st minute he got on the end of a McLister flick to shoot past Collins in the Albion goal.It was now all Tollymore as the Bears pushed for a winner and Albion were reduced to ten-men after Darryl Irwin was dismissed for a cynical foul on Marty Devlin as the striker burst through on goal, after being put clear by Tommy Kane.Virtually on the stroke of full time, Corey Laverty picked out Howard with a superb pass only for Collins to make another excellent save. Extra time saw Tollymore playing with the wind and forcing a succession of corners that Albion did well to defend.Albion seemed content to play for penalty kicks and it was only in the last couple of minutes of the game that they came out of their defensive shell, but were unable to penetrate a resolute Tollymore defence.Albion netted their first penalty with Marty McCourt equalising and then the fun started. Leneghan saved the second spot kick and Albionrsquos Joel Collins then blocked Corey Lavertyrsquos effort to keep things level at -. Leneghan then saved the third Albion kick before Marty Devlin scored to nudge the Bears in front at -.The Moira men levelled things with a cracking penalty leaving United with two more penalties to win. Unfortunately, Howard shot wide to leave the scores - and one penalty apiece left.Once again Leneghan made an unbelievable save to hand the initiative to United and Adam Rea stepped up to blast the ball into the net to send United into the final.Match sponsor: Diamond Pats, Newcastle.Tollymore United Moira Albion MID ULSTER LEAGUE CUP S

South Down MP Chris Hazzard during a meeting in Berlin last weekend with representatives from the Executive Board of the European Left.The MP was warmly received by delegates from the EU member states who congratulated Mr Hazzard on Sinn Feinrsquos recent success in the Irish election.Mr Hazzard said that it was ldquofantastic to receive a warm welcome from representatives of the European Left.He explained that throughout the Brexit negotiations, European solidarity with Ireland was ldquoremarkable and it was fitting that he had the opportunity to thank representatives from across the EU for that support at their Executive Board meeting.Mr Hazzard said that it was also important to take the opportunity to call for continued support in the months ahead.ldquoBrexit is by no means complete and Ireland will need ongoing solidarity as European and British government officials commence trade talks next month, the MP continued.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the British government to adopt a casual approach to their international obligations and responsibilities to protect both the Good Friday Agreement and our all-Ireland economy.Mr Hazzard revealed that it was also ldquofascinating to be involved in a discussion regarding the need to deepen understanding and relations with all European Left parties in the time ahead, especially in relation to tackling the climate emergency, workersrsquo rights, gender equality and the increasing need to counter the growth in extreme, far-right politics throughout Europe.Also this week, the South Down MP described British government immigration proposals as ldquounpopular, unworkable and a direct threat to economic well-being in South Down.Responding to proposals confirmed by the Home Office that immigration policy in Northern Ireland will change from next year, the MP warned that far from strengthening the economic wellbeing of society, the proposals are a direct threat to the local hospitality, tourism, retail and agri-food sectors.Mr Hazzard declared: ldquoIt is hard not to view these proposals as an elitist, xenophobic attack on overseas and low-paid workers, the vast majority of whom we simply cannot live without.ldquoIndeed, most worryingly, these proposals are a cruel attack on our care sector the wonderful, selfless heroes whom we all rely on to take care of us and our families in our hour of need.Mr Hazzard said it is ldquoabundantly clear that the Home Office has completely ignored what he described as the ldquoNorthrsquos unique and special circumstances and has shown nothing but contempt for local business and industry leaders who have engaged constructively with British government officials in recent years.The MP added: ldquoSinn Feacutein will be raising these concerns

roads in NI  ","story":"TWO of the worst roads in Northern Ireland are in Down District and just miles apart, it has been revealed.They are the Shore Road in Strangford and the Blackstaff Road in Clough which are placed first and third respectively in the list of the provincersquos worst roads, the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed.New statistics revealed by the government department confirm that a total of  defects mdash including pot holes mdash were recorded on both roads last year.Government officials say that  defects were recorded on the Shore Road and  on the Blackstaff Road.The Department has confirmed that between  and  it paid out a staggering pound.m to drivers across Northern Ireland whose vehicles had been damaged by potholes.Years of underinvestment has led to a deterioration of Northern Irelandrsquos roads according to Stormont infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, who is making poundm available to help address the issue.The cash will also be used for winter gritting services and to help repair the tens of thousands of street lights that are out across the country.Ms Mallon explained that years of underinvestment as well as the impact of severe winter weather has led to deterioration in the road network and in recent years this has impacted on the level of vehicle damage compensation payments.Last year, Northern Irelandrsquos public spending watchdog warned that it would cost more than poundbn to deal with structural maintenance.The Northern Ireland Audit Office published a report highlighting how a lack of investment was having a deteriorating effect on the overall condition of Northern Irelandrsquos road network and found that a lack of funding had led to a signicant reduction in the number of potholes being recorded and approved for repair.Ms Mallon said that ldquofrustratingly for a number of years now not enough money had been allocated to her departmentrsquos budget to maintain roads and repairs were having to be done on a priority basis.ldquoWhile I have inherited severe and challenging budget constraints, I am committed to finding solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives, she said.ldquoI have impressed on the new finance minister the need for additional money to deal with this issue and other critical pressures. Sustainable infrastructure is key to improving lives and connecting communities.Confirmation of the poundm funding package to deal with roads maintenance, winter gritting and defective street lights comes just weeks after the Recorder revealed that while the lights were back on at Stormont after MLAs ed to work, they were continuing to go out across the district at an alarming rate.In mid-January, almost  street lights were not working in East Down, plunging many areas into darkness and the Department for Infrastructure confirming that due to budgetary pressures it was only able to provide a limited repair service.Province-wide, it was estimated that in excess of , street lights were not working with the government department having only a small number of engineers at its disposal to repair all of them.Downpatrick topped the league table for broken street lights in East Down with  in need of repair. Newcastle was in second place with  street lights not working.Other district hot spots included Ballynahinch where  street lights were out of order, while where,  faults were reported in Killyleagh,  in Castlewellan and Crossgar and  in Saintfield.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has welcomed the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to invest poundm and hopes that many of the potholes and defective street lights across the district will be repaired.He said while the defects will be repaired according to their priority, he hopes that Ms Mallon will secure additional support from the Stormont Executive to carry out a full repair programme.ldquoThe minister is having to deal with a legacy of under investment in the roads network and she must be given every assistance by her Stormont colleagues. There are clearly budgetary pressures across a range of departments but it is is vital that we invest in our roads and wastewater infrastructure in particular, continued Cllr Curran.ldquoMs Mallon clearly has the needs of people at heart and hopefully she will be given additional monies to help address the particular problems we have in Down District. It is important that all road repairs are carried out to a high standard to that the work will last..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down GAA.jpg","title":"Down goals revive hopes  ","story":"DOWN left it late before getting the better of Longford at a bitterly cold Pairc Esler on Saturday night.Itrsquos ever so tight now in the race for second place behind an unbeaten Cork in the Division  table with Down, Longford, Derry and Offaly all on five points after four games.Saturdayrsquos game seemed to be heading for a draw as the sides were locked at - to - with less than  minutes remaining.However, two late goals from Cory Quinn and James Guinness put paid to a brave Longford challenge as Down ran out two point winners.Longford were dealt a blow before the game with star forward Rian Brady ruled out with a chest infection and his replacement, Peter Lynn, who scored two points in the early exchanges, had to go off injured after  minutes.It was Lynn who opened the scoring in the first minute, but Downrsquos fleet-footed set of forwards quickly got into gear and created scores for Barryand Darren OrsquoHagan before Liam Connerton brought the sides level again in the sixth minute.Cory Quinn and Lynn swapped scores as did Jonny Flynn and Darren Gallagher to leave the sides in deadlock at - apiece after  minutes.Flynn and Donal OrsquoHare then edged Down two clear as the first half headed for conclusion, but a total of six points were scored in added time.Gallagher and a rsquo from lsquokeeper Paddy Collum made it - apiece, but Kevin McKernan pointed Down back into the lead. This advantage was quickly cancelled out by Gallagher, but Down continued to press and further scores from Liam Kerr and Barry OrsquoHagan sent the home side into the break with a - to - lead.Down controlled play at the start of the second half and points from OrsquoHare and Quinn stretched their lead to four points.However, no sooner had the Down supporters started to relax as their side moved well clear, when Longford roared back with - without reply to take a shock - to - lead.Connerton rocked the boat when he goaled out of nothing and when Dessie Reynolds and Gallaghertagged on points, the visitors were suddenly in the driving seat.Down now faced an uphill task, but they refused to panic and with  minutes gone Liam Kerr started the fightback with a point from play.Barry OrsquoHagan converted a free and it was suddenly all square again, but the predatory Quinn pounced to give Down a - to - lead with five minutes remaining with a well-worked goal.A free from Daniel Mimnagh another rsquo from Collum saw Longford trail by a single point with only a matter of minutes left on the clock.Down really went for broke at this stage and they were rewarded when James Guinness showed his versatility with a cool finish when he put the home side into an unassailable - to - lead with the  minutes almost up.Longford never stopped trying, but all they had to show for their efforts was another Mimnagh point.Down take to the road again this weekend when they head to OrsquoConnor Park to take on Offaly on Sunday afternoon for another must win game.Down: R Burns, S Annett, P Murdock, R McAleenan, G Collins, D OrsquoHagan , B McArdle, J Flynn , D Guinness, B OrsquoHagan , K McKernan , L KerrD OrsquoHare , A Morgan, C Quinn .

I welcome a review initiated by the government department to look at the impact of this legislation which needs to be amended so many local events can thrive once again.Cllr Devlin said while there were many positive aspects of the new legislation, such as providing a framework to ensure special events can be held on roads safely and legally, there were a number which have caused great dficulty to charities, running clubs and other groups doing vital work in the community.ldquoWhen this legislation was introduced by a previous minister there was uproar among local community groups, football and running clubs as well as charities who all hosted small road races to raise vital funds for their own causes, she explained.ldquoThis legislation represents another layer of red tape and, for many, resulted in them ceasing such events which was very disappointing for all involved.Cllr Devlin explained that while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos policy was amended to accommodate local not-for-profit groups, the Stormont legislation remained ldquoflawed.She continued: ldquoI welcome that Minister Mallon has confirmed that she is aware of the concerns around the legislation mdash introduced before her time in office mdash and has committed to reviewing it. This common-sense approach is very welcome.ldquoThe government department has confirmed that the review will commence in the coming months, with Ms Mallon seeking views and asking stakeholders to engage with the process.

However, the securing and locating of a temporary mobile facility for the short-term was welcome.Mr McGrath said that while the building was able to use a generator provided by the contractor for the switching-on of a sustainable Christmas tree provided by the council, the generator did not remain in place.He continued: ldquoI have contacted council and made representations and have been told the relevant committee has discussed and approved the long-term use of a generator which will allow activities to commence soon.

Archaeologists and conservation architects within the department worked together to design a historically appropriate roof.What has been achieved is an outstanding piece of architecture that safeguards this important and historic place.“The project has been designed to be sustainable on many levels. The materials used are durable, traditional materials. The oak used for the roof is from a sustainable source.”The minister added:“Heritage forms a key component of our tourism economy.

Some politicians began to converge on a stupid solution: privatising MOT tests to save public cash.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...If that happened, then instead of going to government-run test centres, a car owner would go to a garage to get the road worthiness tests done, as happens in England and Wales. It is a very bad idea.It would be privatising a sphere of public le where we should instead keep out any hint of profit.Inevitably, garages that issue MOT certicates have a vested financial interest in telling vehicle owners they need to get work done.Most car owners, like most computer owners or most homeowners,know nothing about the mechanics of cars . So when they are told something needs to be done to their carand that it will cost £X, they can only stand blinking at the person who is telling them so, because they do not have the expertise to know better.In Great Britain there are said to be safeguards against this commercial incentive on the part of MOT garages to tell you that you need work done . I make two observations in response. The first is an anecdote. The only time I needed an MOT in England, in the s, I was told by an MOT approved garage in north London that I needed to spend hundreds of pounds on something that, in the end, after further research, I didn’t need done at all.The second is a startling statistic that this newspaper carried on the front page some years ago.In Great Britain, where cars were then first testedafter three years on road that initial MOT was failed by .% of cars.In Northern Ireland, where cars are first tested after four years, the initial failure rate was a mere .%.Cars in the Province had a far higher pass rate than newer cars in Great Britain, despite the NI cars having a full extra year of usage and wear and tear than the GB ones.Neil Greig, of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, told the News Letter: “This clearly shows there is something wrong with the system in Great Britain. It is failing cars at three years old that should be passed. The suspicion is that it is to get garages business.“The system is supposed to be tightly controlled, but there are still legions of stories about people going to a garage and feeling that they have been ripped off.”It would be madness to introduce that system into NI, replacing our rigorously impartial system, but some voices are calling for it due to the current MOT delays. Stormont, which loves easy solutions, could axe our MOT centres.For many years I have driven old but quality cars, including a Toyota and Honda. I find it a cost effective way to run a reliable car.Some years ago, I asked an NI garage near where I then worked to tell me what it needed for MOT. They said it needed A, B, C, D, E done, cost £. I didn’t have time to get a second opinion, said fine, and booked it in. But before I got the work done I was driving past a garage in Co Down that specialised in some of the things I was told I needed, so I stopped and said: “I’m due MOT, I think the car is OK butyou could just check A, B, C, D, E.” The garage said A. B and C need done, not D and E. The estimated bill for the work plummeted. Baffled, I went to a trye-brake outfit and asked them to assess A, B, C. They said only A, B need done. The total bill was only £, not £, so I cancelled the booking at the first garage, got the basic work done, booked an MOT, and passed.This is not to imply that garages are fraudulent. They might, for example, be doing what sales folk call ‘selling up’ and advising you to get work done earlier than needed.But getting second quotations is too time consuming, so latterly prior to an MOT I have just fixed basics – tyres, lights and brakes— then put the car through to seeit passes.The vehicle is being assessed by an impartial adjudicator who has no vested interest in telling you whether or not it is roadworthy. If it fails thenyou pay a re-test fee, which helps fund the system.It is a good system, that we should keep.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: There will be an internal UK border in the Irish Sea, whatever Michael Gove says"},{"url":null,"title":"bishop it entirely misleading imply any defiance church ireland marriage stance ","story":"Sinn Fein says Gerry Adams can keep all £k Oireachtas pension – but it will slash all future retirement payments for TDsSudden death of person on NI railway line being investigated by PSNI - line now reopenedNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensNewsOpinionColumnistsBishop: It is entirely misleading to imply any defiance of the Church of Ireland marriage stanceWith regard to your headline and front page story on same-sex marriage and the position of the Church of Ireland .By Dr Kenneth KearonFriday, th February , : amUpdated Friday, th February , : am\"\"Comment was made in the context of a response to an Northern Ireland Office consultation on same-sex religious marriage‘Same-sex marriage: Church of Ireland body declares gay people should be able to wed’I would repeat the information provided to your journalist, verbatim.This was made in the context of a response to the Northern Ireland Office’s consultation on same-sex religious marriage and conversion entitlements:Letter to the editor \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It affirms that religious officiants should not be able to solemnise a same-sex marriage in situations where their governing body has not approved same-sex marriage. Even where a governing body has approved same-sex marriage and made provision for it, a clergyperson should have the right to refuse to conduct such a marriage . Where a religious officiant refuses to marry a same-sex couple, that officiant should not be considered to have acted in breach of equality legislation.• Civil partnershipsThe church’s decision not to provide for same-sex marriage is unchanged. The doctrine of the Church of Ireland is that marriage is between one man and one woman this is therefore the only form of marriage which may be celebrated within the church. Anglican doctrine is expressed through liturgy, and the Church has no liturgy in relation to civil partnership or same-sex marriage. The context for the response is that there has been an alteration of the legal framework affecting a range of civil provisions, but this will not affect the church’s teaching.Your headline is entirely misleading in implying that the Church and Society Commission has decided to defy the doctrinal position of the Church of Ireland exactly the contrary was made clear in the response to the newspaper.The House of Bishops, in its statement following the  marriage referendum in the Republic, affirmed that the state is acting fully within its rightsit decides to alter its legal definition of marriage.This does not affect or alter the church’s understanding of how it celebrates marriage.The Rt Revd Dr Kenneth Kearon, Bishop of Limerick and Killaloe, chair, Church and Society Commission"},{"url":null,"title":"simple steps anyone can take help contain coronavirus ","story":"Sinn Fein says Gerry Adams can keep all £k Oireachtas pension – but it will slash all future retirement payments for TDsSudden death of person on NI railway line being investigated by PSNI - line now reopenedNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensNewsOpinionSimple steps that anyone can take to help contain the coronavirusThat a patient in Northern Ireland has now tested positive for coronavirus is highly regrettable but hardly surprising.By The NewsroomFriday, th February , : amUpdated Friday, th February , : am\"\"News Letter editorialThe virus is spreading rapidly round the world, and has been identied in more than  countries.The details of the NI affected patient, believed to be a woman who travelled up to the Province from Dublin with a child, and her exact movements are not yet known.

Please try again later.Submitting...Even in a settled society such as Scotland it is extraordinarily dficult to persuadea majority of the public to vote for radical constitutional upheaval. But in a ided society such as Northern Ireland, with history pointing to the clear potential for discrimination, recrimination and violence, it is more dficult still for those in favour of Irish unity to win the argument – even at a time when the old Protestant majority is vanishing.Although polling evidence is contradictory – with Belfast firm Lucid Talk’s polls consistently suggesting higher levels of support for Irish unity than most other polls – next week polling will be released which for several reasons will make grim reading for republicans.Even after all the turmoil of Brexit, of three years without devolved government, of the cash for ash scandal, of the distrusted Boris Johnson as prime minister, there is scant evidence of the sort of surge in support for Irish unity which would be necessary to win a border poll.This week a group of senior academics headed by The Constitution Unit at University College London but encompassing professors in Belfast, Dublin and the US came to Belfast to take evidence about how any future border poll would work.A separate academic team at another English university is working on another signicant project examining related questions.The very fact that more than  years after the Belfast Agreement basic questions around the practicalities of a border poll have not been resolved – or in many cases even asked – implicitly points to a failure of Sinn Féin.The party which has Irish reunication as its central goal and which now accepts that the only way that can happen is by winning a border poll has put far less energy into resolving how that could happen than it has into the sort of political disputes and manoeuvringwhich have brought it to electoral dominance within nationalism.Belatedly, republicans now appear to be adopting some of the tactics of Brexiteers ahead of the EU Referendum. Just as Brexiteers, realising that Ukip were toxic to many voters, set up surrogate organisations – from ‘Business for Britain’ to ‘Students for Britain’ – to carry their message to otherwise unreachable groups, soseveral republican groups which are not publicly linked to Sinn Féin have now sprung up.Those groups have been more effective than the party at stimulating debate and encouraging some unionists to engage in that debate.Nevertheless, even those groups have made limited progress in persuading those who do not instinctively want a united Ireland – or a ‘new Ireland’, as it is now branded – of the imperative for that to happen.While the Secretary of State retains a discretionary power to call a border poll at any time the mandatory trigger for him to have to call a referendum remains opaque.\u2028The  Agreement states that“ at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the UK”, then he must call a referendum.The Agreement is not prescriptive on the criteria to be taken into account when deciding on the issue.Five weeks before the Brexit vote I hypothetically asked the then Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers, whether she would take an overall majority for nationalism at Stormont or opinion polls as an indication of support for a united Ireland. She said vaguely that the NIO would consider “all the relevant facts”.If such a poll was called, it is unclear what roles the British and Irish governments would or could play. Some people believe both governments should be neutral.But how could the Irish government be neutral when it is not only constitutionally obliged to support Irish unity, but would also be the only body which could make credible promises to voters as to what a vote for unity would entail Central to any successfulIrish unity campaign would almost certainly be a clear plan – or at least a sufficiently convincing one – as to what would happen after such a vote.An agreed plan – akin to the Scottish government’s document prior to the  independence referendum –would make it harder for unionism to make the argument that, as with Brexit, people would be voting to end the current constitutional clarity and enter a period of uncertainty. Some republicans believe that unionists will come on board to discuss what should be in that proposal.While there will be exceptions who prove the rule, there is little evidence of unionists willing to assist with such a process – as distinct from taking part in discussions where they argue the unionist case.In fact, it would be profoundly illogical for unionists to help with something which would make the end of the Union easier – unless they believed that they would inevitably lose such a plebiscite, which is not a commonly held view.Unionists working on a plan to build a united Ireland would be the equivalent of republicans working on a plan to make the Union more attractive – it would be antithetical to their ideological interests.Any signicant body of unionists being involved in such a process only seems realisticthey have lost a border poll, meaning that until that point the onus is on nationalists to present an attractive proposition which will persuade voters.As a Sinn Féin member this week admitted, with unusual candour, to the BBC, the sort of ‘up the Ra’ comments and other triumphalist episodes which marked Sinn Féin’s recent southern electoral success do nothing to persuade unionists that they are serious about the ‘new Ireland’ rhetoric.Some people believe that ‘citizens’ assemblies’ – a trendy attempt to circumvent seemingly intractable political problems – could bring ordinary unionists on board eventheir leaders refused.But aside from the dficulties of such a process being infected by either conscious or unconsciousbias, the legitimacy of citizens’ assemblies rests on the argument of their proponents that those selected to sit on them are chosen randomly, making them at least quasi-democratic.If ordinary unionists refused to participate, such bodies would not be remotely representative.Thus far there is signicant reason to believethat the scale of change is less decisive that eitherthose unionists who despair the Union is over would fear or those nationalists who believe Irish unity is inevitable now hope to be the case.What happens next will be shaped by the decisions of those who lead unionism and nationalism, as well as by global social and economic forces far beyond their control.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

On February , , her then boyfriend of two years David sat down at home to watch the TV coverage of his beloved Northern Ireland play at their home ground of Windsor Park.What happened at half time was certainly something he wasn’t expecting. For there, right in the middle of the pitch, cheered on by delighted fans, was Lisa, standing with a huge banner which spelled out the six words that were to change his le forever: David Houston, will you marry me Joanne Palmer and her husband IanThankfully David said yes and the pair, who live in Claudy, tied the knot in October , a year and a half after the Leap Day proposal. Eight years on, Lisa, , and David, , are as happy as ever and now the proud parents of three sons, George, , Elliot, , and Henry, . Lisa, who works in a nursing home in Omagh, said the idea of taking matrimonial matters into her own hands was quite a random one.“David’s friends had tickets to a Northern Ireland game, but he said he couldn’t be bothered going, so I said I’d like to go as I had never been to a football match.“I asked him what date it was on, and when he said February , I said, are you sure you want me to go ’ But he was so busy watching the Super Sunday game that he didn’t even take me on.”Lisa then got in touch with the Irish Football Association to seethey would allow her to ask Sky TV to point their cameras at her during the match so she could hold up her proposal. But Sky told her that she would need to actually come on to the pitch. The first half of the match passed without a single goal, which didn’t help Lisa’s nerves. Then, when the whistle blew, she made her way onto the pitch, helped by a couple of David’s friends, and unveiled the five foot banner, which she had ordered online, proclaiming the question of all questions.“It was the longest five minutes of my le waiting for the phone to ring to hear a yes, ” she recalled..“Finally he rang and said, what are you at ’, and I said, well ’. He said yes, and I shouted his answer to the crowd and got a massive cheer. It was hilarious.’’Looking back on that momentous day, Lisa admitted she doesn’t knowshe would have the guts to do it now. ‘‘David and me talk about it sometimes and I thinkI was to do it now, I’d be more nervous. But David would say that he is still chuffed to bits to this day that I did it - it was a brave thing to do and it was a nice thing that happened to him.’’And he even received a signed Northern Ireland shirt as a result of his then girlfriend’s plucky proposal.Lisa’s advice to other women contemplating the big question today is simple - ‘go for it’. ‘‘If you’ve found the person you want to spend the rest of your le with, it doesn’t really matter who asks who. Andyou don’t you’ll have to wait another four years.’’The tradition of women proposing on leap day is thought to date back to th-century Ireland when St Bridget complained to St Patrick that women had to wait too long for suitors to propose.He then gave women a single day in a leap year to pop the question - the last day of the shortest month.Legend has it that Brigid then dropped to a knee and proposed to Patrick that instant, but he refused, kissing her on the cheek and offering a silk gown to soften the blow.Others believe the tradition originates from Scotland when Queen Margaret, then aged just five, declared in  that a woman could propose to any man she liked on February .Another woman who decided to do the asking was Joanne Palmer, , from Ballykelly, Co Londonderry.In  Joanne was working at Butlins in Minehead, Somerset. A week into her job as deputy manager of the nursery, the then -year-old met Ian, , who was on holidays at the resort with his friends. Joanne recalled: ‘‘We were in one of the nightclubs in Butlins and his friend was trying to chat me up, but I kept looking at Ian and he kept looking at me. The next night after that we met and got chatting ourselves. So, it was a holiday romance at the beginning.’’After Ian ed home to Cornwall, the lovestruck pair maintained their romance writing letters to each other and chatting on the phone. A year later Ian also got a job at Butlins and that, said Joanne, was when they ‘‘started getting serious’’ about each other. Joanne was ‘‘madly in love’’ with ‘‘tall, blonde’’ Ian and decided she wanted to marry him. ‘‘I think we both knew that we were going to be together, It just felt right.‘‘I remember reading Leap Year Day was the day women could propose and I have to say that he was the nearest thing to perfect that I had ever met.’’Butlins had closed for February, but the lovebirds stayed on, Joanne working as a chalet maid and Ian doing security. Joanne, a self-confessed terrible cook, decided to sweeten the proposal by baking a cake on her ‘wee two-ring cooker’’ in her room. She added: ‘‘I had bought a ring in Minehead that cost £, just so that I could put it onhe said yes.’’Prior to the big question, Joanne admits she felt anxious. ‘‘I am quite a confident person, but I was really, really nervous that day.‘‘He came in and sat down and I got down on one knee and I said ‘Ian, will you marry me ’ and I lted out the cake and he said ‘you, didn’t bake that’ and then he said ‘yes’.A few months later the pair came back to Northern Ireland for a holiday,‘‘Ian said he wanted topropose to me, but he wanted to do things right,’’ said Joanne, ‘‘so he took my dad to one side and asked himhe could have permission to marry his daughter. Really old-fashioned. And then in front of all my cousins and aunts and uncles, he proposed then.’’Ian and Joanne got married on January , , now have two children, Bradley, , and Abigail, , and have just celebrated our th wedding anniversary.Joanne said: ‘‘Every leap year day I wonder who  is doing it.’’Her advice to other women contemplating a proposal is this: ‘‘If you are going to do it, it has to be that person who is dferent than anybody  you have ever met, you have to have that feeling that this is the person you want to spend the rest of your le with. It’s very serious. I think people take marriage too lightly these days. ‘‘Before I met Ian I was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritisand when I first met him I was absolutely fine, but just before we got married it got a lot worse. I went through a lot and he stood by me. He’s a hard-worker. He’s a good man. ‘‘We’ll be together  years in June. I don’t think I could imagine spending that time with anybody .’’\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

The Minister will be aware of incidents in my own community. Why have the Government not yet proscribed these organisations, and what steps will they take to review the situation urgently And I asked Home Office ministers why we should trust them over deportation flights when there are serious unresolved concerns about the Windrush scandal and wider detention and deportation policies.I said: ldquoThe Minister is asking us to trust a Department and system that have had repeated and costly failures.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

With their parents Sam and Christina , they lived in Florence Court, Edenderry. A fth brother Bertie, tragically died at a young age.The four brothers shared an unbreakable bond centred chiefly around football. They played together for The Church Lads Brigade and were members of the Edenderry United Team which won the McKinney Cup in . Joe went on to play for three seasons for BanbridgeTown and during these seasons the team was unbeaten. Indeed, Joe had a trial for an Under  Intermediate Team.In his mid s he stood in for an absent member of a rugby team and ended up as a scrum half and team captain. He was a long associate of Chambers’ Park Rugby and wore his Club blazer with immense pride.Joe married Pearl Forde in  andever there was a ‘marriage made in heaven’ this was it.They adored each other and ‘sparred’ with one another as only true soulmates can. They had one adored daughter, Elizabeth, who tragically died aged  in  a sorrow Joe and Pearl bore in quiet faith. Le was never the same for Joe after his beloved Pearl died on  February .Joe, as with all his siblings, was raised in a Christian home and infused with a quiet yet unbending Christian faith. His willingness to bear the burdens of others and his desire to aid his fellow man manested itself in his role as a trade union shop stewart. His integrity and forthrightness earned respect and in most of his workplaces he was both foreman and shop steward. Physically tough he relied upon God in times of sorrow for the inner strength which toughness cannot supply.He was also, with his brothers, a member of Seagoe Church Lads Brigade Pipe Band and the quartet of three pipers and a drummer often practiced in the front room of their family home.Joe also thoroughly enjoyed the Lambeg Drums and Saturday nights in his mid to latter years were spent at ious drumming competitions. Joe was employed in ious weaving factories, one of which was Brookfield Mill in Banbridge and he was heartbroken when it closed down.Pearl and Joe and Elizabeth enjoyed many seasons at their caravan in Kilkeel and Saturday nights were taken up with playing pool with his good friend Sinclair Brown. Later they upgraded to a bigger caravan and continued their trips until Pearl’s death.Joe lived all his le in Edenderry and much of his married le in the house beside his parents in Watson Street.In his latter years after Pearl’s death Joe had a very structured schedule. A daily trip up the town included first stop Winnie’s Newsagent in Woodhouse Street for his paper, which had to be rolled up and secured with an elastic band. Next visit was to Gaynor’s Cafe in Church Lane where the staff didn’t even need to ask what Joe’s order was but once his foot crossed the door they had already started preparing it. His night time routine included a walk up around Portadown. But when family became concerned for his safety, he assured them that nobody would touch him and that he always carried his walking stick anyhow.As an avid Edenderry man, Joe was heavily involved in the generational annual construction of Edenderry arch. Mr Roney’s funeral was on Monday February  in Seagoe Parish Church following by interment in Seagoe Cemetery.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191205_4696_web.jpg","title":"pulse pr a decade in northern ireland communications","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Pulse PR’s Grainne McGarvey sits down with Ulster Business at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast to chat about marking  years in business amid an evolving media landscape, growing from strong entrepreneurial family roots and the next step in her company’s journey A bold decision a decade ago to go out on her own and establish Pulse PR has seen Grainne McGarvey work with a range of clients to help sell their message to a wider audience. In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
