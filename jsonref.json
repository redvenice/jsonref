Among the scenes from the film that could now be frowned upon is a sequence when Aykroyd’s character ‘blacks up’ on a train and others featuring Curtis’s character Ophelia topless.But the decision to swap the genders of two of the film’s key roles for the stage show will be seen as controversial by many of the movie’s more devoted fans.One showbusiness source, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Everyone is sworn to secrecy about the project at the moment but the plan is to turn Eddie’s character into a woman and to have the character of the prostitute played by Jamie Lee Curtis become transgender. When the film was released in 1983, it was enormously successful yet now it is perceived in some quarters as racist and politically incorrect.

Because it offers escapism at a time of towering property pricesThe Drive curves quietly through the green of Maresfield Park, past mature trees, grass verges and tall, polite hedges that offer glimmers of the homes beyond: slate roofs, mullion windows, block-paving, gravel.Once part of a local manor house estate, the land here was requisitioned during the first world war and afterwards parcelled up and sold as separate plots. In the decades since, those plots have become architectural playgrounds of a sort, adventures in Georgian, Regency and Tudorbethan styles, updated and remodelled, with conservatories, annexes and bifold doors.It would be easy to miss Bella and Nick Honness Roe’s house. Set back from the road, it is a low-lying brick building with a carport. Built in 1963, it was designed by local architects for a sea captain who retired to this landlocked corner of East Sussex. Save for its gull-wing roof, it has few of the frills of its neighbours.The couple moved here in the autumn of 2015, shortly after the birth of their second child, leaving behind their two-bedroom flat with cantilevered stairs on the Golden Lane estate in London. “It was tiny,” says Bella. “Our living space was the size of what is now our playroom. And that was fine when we had one child. But then we were hankering after more space, and this place came up …”For Bella, a film academic, and her husband, a marketing specialist, the appeal was not so much the location, near Gatwick airport and the M25, but the excitement of the house itself. She walks me through the building, from the kitchen along the light-filled corridor that leads to the bedrooms. “It’s all the original stuff,” she says. “The design of that period was very liveable – built-in furniture and wood-panelling, built-in Formica.” They found the property via the Modern House, an estate agency that launched in 2005 and swiftly acquired a cult online following through its website, mailing list and, later, Instagram. It specialises in design-led, architecturally intriguing properties from former factories to art deco gems, modernist estates, urban spaces, loft conversions, new-builds and even partnerships with Turner prize-winning architects Assemble.The peculiar thing about the Modern House is that it has become such a colossal hit with those who could never hope to afford even the cheapest of its listings. For many, it serves not so much as an estate agency but as something we can pleasurably gawp at, in much the same way as Holly Golightly in the film Breakfast at Tiffany’s, penniless but dreaming, was wont to stare at the window displays of the luxury jewellery store and feel that “nothing very bad could happen” there.“I derive a lot of pleasure from looking at beautifully curated spaces,” says a fan of the website, Wilhemina Madeley, 30. “Although I don’t own a house myself and that continues to be a distant dream (especially in London), I often feel inspired by how spaces are transformed through colour, art and carefully selected items of furniture. More often than not, I look at the properties between £350,000 and £500,000 because I like to see what I could potentially afford in the future and how people have transformed small and challenging spaces.”The Modern House, with its homes’ ordered beauty and outlandish prices, serves as a form of escapism. How sweet life would be, we think to ourselves, if we could spend our days in such open-plan, light-filled harmony.Bella had long been on the Modern House mailing list. “I’ve always been slightly obsessed with modernist architecture,” she explains. When she first spotted the listing, it was at an emotionally charged time – shortly after the death of her mother, when Bella was four months pregnant.“We weren’t even seriously looking, and I just said: ‘Let’s just go look at this house this weekend.’ It was the sort of house I’d always loved it was geographically just about doable it was just about workable for work it wasn’t too far from London it was near a town that looked nice …” That was in April. In July, they put in an offer. “It took us a really long time to get over taking that leap,” she says. “And in the end we just realised we would never know if it was right for us unless we just did it.”There are other property sites with devoted followings – Cheap Old Houses, for instance, the Instagram celebration of largely US doer-uppers sites dedicated to French chateaus and Tuscan farmhouses, all of which offer a ersion from the drudgery of our daily existence. But what marks out the Modern House is the enduring appeal of its aesthetic and the remarkable affection in which it is held. While other estate agents are often regarded with suspicion, the Modern House is thought of by some of its fans as a friend.The Modern House London offices occupy the ground floor of St Alphege hall, a 1930s church hall in Borough, south London. Here, Matt Gibberd and his business partner, Albert Hill, employ 25 office-based staff they have more across the country. Both 41, they met at school in Dorset, where Gibberd recalls that Hill “was very much always an entrepreneurial spirit. Even in those days he was always up to something. He decided he wanted to collect obscure training shoes, so he would buy these boxfresh Nikes and store them in his cupboard.” Hill would sell the trainers to collectors in Japan. “And then his dad had a garage studio where you couldn’t get through the door because it had all of Albert’s Memphis Group furniture in it.”A few years later, when they were both journalists writing about architecture and design, Hill had what he describes as a “lightbulb moment” – realising he could apply the same approach he had taken to selling collectable trainers and furniture to selling collectable houses. “And I didn’t need to put them in my dad’s garage.” Hill’s grandfather was an interior designer, and for a time his father worked finding land for a housing association. When he was nine, the family moved somewhat abruptly from south London to Lyme Regis, to an arts and crafts house on the seafront – his parents having once told its owners to let them know if they ever felt compelled to sell. “They said that would be the only reason that they would ever leave London,” he says. “And they got the call one day. So we had to pack up our London home, our London life and all go down to Dorset.” He smiles. “That’s one of the things that informed the business – the idea that, for one house, you would change everything.”Gibberd, whose father and grandfather were both architects, had also inherited the family interest in buildings. “It sounds a bit pathetic now but aged 13 I would’ve asked my parents for a book on architecture and minimalism for Christmas,” he says. “We lived in quite a few different places, buying and selling around Islington,” he recalls. “And that’s where I also learned about the commercial side of housing. Which is a bit of a taboo subject, but is a reality and the reason why we’re able to do what we do. We always say we’re really lucky because we get to indulge in our passion, which is architecture and design, but we’ve also found a way of monetising it.”The first property they marketed was Six Pillars in Dulwich, south London. “Which is a Tecton house,” Hill says. “Grade II*.” Although it was already on the market with another agency, Hill and Gibberd called the owner and told him about their fledgling company. “He said: ‘Great, let’s do it!’” Hill recalls. “He said the other agency didn’t understand the house.”The house still took a while to sell, and not just because of the £1.3m price tag. “The thing about the pure modern movement houses, especially the early ones, is they’re museum pieces,” Hill says. “It’s always going to take quite an enlightened buyer who’s going to live in it in that slightly reverential way.“Back then, investing all of your life savings in a house that was design-led, that was such an oddity in the market, you had to have pretty strong nerves,” he adds. “That’s changed considerably. It’s partly this shift to people being interested in experiences over objects. The space in your home is where you experience most of your life. Back then, a house was more seen as a bank account or just bricks and mortar.”There has also been a shift in our approach to location. When the Modern House launched, it broke with the conventional estate agent model of serving only one geographical area. “Instead, we celebrate the house and try and attract people from beyond that area,” says Gibberd. The bulk of the Modern House’s properties are in southern England, although there is a regional spread. At any one time, its roster might range from a £95,000 chapel in Suffolk to a £10m architect-designed house in Hampstead, north London.“The lower end of the market always sells so well,” says Hill. “One of the founding principles was: it’s not about price, it really is about design, and we’ve always tried to keep as broad a price spectrum as we can.” “It’s extraordinary, the rise of interest in these homes,” says John Grindrod, author of Concretopia: A Journey Around the Rebuilding of Postwar Britain. “I think Grand Designs has had a bit to do with it, and I think it’s partly a reaction against developers’ houses of the 80s and 90s – heritage design, fake Tudor, with small rooms and small windows. Instead, these houses are open, with entire glazed walls.”It’s part of an ongoing see-saw of architectural taste, Grindrod argues, from the Tudorbethan styles of the 30s to the Scandi-modern design of the 50s, and then back to mock Tudor in the 80s. “And that see-saw, it’s kind of an argument about how we want to live. Whether it’s the shy, retiring, heritage way that’s slightly more anonymous, or these forward-looking, open, statement modern houses you can see into, which are the opposite of curtain-twitching British life. They are almost stage sets for people’s lives.”The Modern House has been “more insulated than most” to the uncertainty of Brexit, says Hill. Still, the precarious market is one factor that has led the Modern House to consider entering the rental market – offering a stepping stone, perhaps, to the design-conscious people who regularly dip into their listings, but could only dream of owning. It would also open up a new market for the company, whose greatest problem might be that, while the average length of home ownership in the UK is seven years, the Modern House rarely sees re-sales. The kind of property it features has evolved as well. “Aesthetically, there’s certainly been a shift away from lightweight structure to more heavy brick, more grounded architecture,” says Gibberd. Hill agrees: “The timber and render look has been replaced by a heavier solidity, references to classicism.” A desire for sturdiness perhaps, in a time of political and economic flux.The Modern House has moved on, too, from the aesthetic that made its name. “It went very modern movement for a while, but as soon as it feels like something has become embedded in the consciousness, that’s the time to change it,” Gibberd says. “So we thought: ‘We need to look further back now.’”Still, its mailing list remains a source of fascination, inspiration and fantasy for many. “There are lots of interiors magazines and blogs, but for people who look at our website, it’s got that extra level of it being real,” Gibberd says.

In the UK, the medication and extraction procedure costs about £5,000 and is usually the biggest expense for prospective parents going though the procedure.Goldman staff will be expected to pay for any long-term freezing and storage themselves, which usually costs £125-£250 a year.The bank’s workforce will be offered up to $20,000 to purchase eggs from donors, though the stipend is more likely to be of greater benefit to staff in countries such as the US where donors are paid more for their contributions. In Britain, it is illegal to pay for egg donation but donors can be compensated by up to £750.Goldman Sachs said its new “pathways to parenthood” programme would boost the $5,000 payment it previously offered to employees paying for a surrogate mother to carry their child to $20,000. Staff will also be offered $10,000 to cover the costs of adoption, up from $5,000.The benefits, which were introduced on 1 November, come nearly a year after Goldman Sachs added sex-reassignment surgery and IVF fertility treatments to its employee benefit plan. The bank also launched a programme to ship mothers’ breast milk home to their children if they had to work overseas and it offers London staff emergency nannies to look after unwell children and care for elderly relatives.A number of firms have been ramping up benefits for parents in a move that campaigners have said could help close the UK’s gender pay gap. Investment group Standard Life Aberdeen most recently revealed one of the UK’s most generous parental leave policies, offering nine months of full pay for all new parents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12023513ba305e0cc843bc7dbe5b77f74ebf08c2/0_97_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7129c546c62c32765918af404574fae0","title":"mcdonalds pays ousted chief 675000 in severance deal","story":"Steve Easterbrook, who had relationship with employee, also gets two-year ban on working for competitorSteve Easterbrook, the British-born chief executive fired by McDonald’s for having a consensual relationship with an employee, will be allowed to keep stock awards worth more than $37m as well as about $675,000 (£524,000) in severance pay, the fast food firm said on Monday.The relationship, about which little is known, contravened McDonald’s company policy. The termination was categorized as “without cause”, the Chicago-based firm said, signaling that the transgression wasn’t so severe as the prevent him from receiving exit payments.The company said on Monday its global chief people officer, David Fairhurst, would also leave but did not give any reasons.Easterbrook, 52, was born in Watford and joined McDonald’s in 1993. He left in 2011 to become chief executive of Pizza Express and later Wagamama, before rejoining McDonald’s in its head office in Illinois as global chief brand officer in 2013. He became chief executive two years later. He also has a seat on the board at Walmart.According to his LinkedIn profile, Fairhurst has been with McDonald’s for nearly 15 years, holding key human resources positions. Like Easterbrook, he ascended to the upper reaches of McDonald’s US operation via the UK office.The termination of the two executives speaks to increasing pressure on large corporations to act decisively in instances where executives’ conduct threatens the reputation of the company.“CEOs are the face of the company, and stake holders expect them to be aligned with its core values,” noted Jordan Cohen, marketing officer at North 6th Agency. “This goes against the perception of the McDonald’s brand identity and the company is going to need to navigate this carefully.”The subsequent firing of the McDonald’s head of HR, Cohen added, suggests a broader breakdown at executive levels of the company.“These types of scandals don’t come out of nowhere so clearly there was a breakdown there. Someone was aware of the situation and did not act to address it, didn’t surface it to the board, or was acting to protect the CEO and not the interests of the company.”McDonald’s response, Cohen added, “shows the board took the misconduct seriously”.Given Easterbrook’s 2018 base salary of $1.35m, his severance pay would amount to around $675,000. He received total compensation of $15.9m in 2018, according to a regulatory filing which showed he was also eligible for 18 months of health benefits. Easterbrook’s separation agreement contains a two-year post-termination non-competition clause, which is six months longer and more expansive in scope than his existing agreements.An exhaustive list of companies for which Easterbrook may not work in that period was included in the separation agreement. Burger King, Five Guys, Checker’s, Tim Horton’s, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Subway, Chick-fil-A, Chipotle and Domino’s Pizza were among fast food companies named. The list also included coffee outlets Starbucks, Caffe Nero and Costa.Easterbrook’s time at the top of McDonald’s has featured a drive to use more technology in restaurants and to offer customers more fresh ingredients. The company has faced challenges negotiating with franchisees and a push by employees for union rights and protection against such issues as sexual harassment and discrimination.Jonathan Maze, the editor of Restaurant Business magazine, told the Washington Post that Easterbrook had been “pretty consequential” to the business. In a note quoted by the Wall Street Journal, analysts at investment bank Piper Jaffray \u0026amp Co advised investors to look to other fast food stocks, because “changes of this magnitude tend to be disruptive”.In an email to McDonald’s staff, the orced father of three acknowledged the relationship, and said it was a mistake. “Given the values of the company, I agree with the board that it is time for me to move on,” Easterbrook wrote.Desiree Moore, a Chicago-based lawyer acting as spokeswoman for Easterbrook, said he was “deeply grateful for his time at McDonald’s” and would not comment further."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/611c54175f9d6d48c1fd20fcefd23a2dfab497ae/0_323_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f8be484e56cac24c9f04c86aef90783","title":"under the wrecking ball london families placed in housing slated for demolition","story":"Local authorities in London have moved families into council estates that are planned for demolition – and campaigners say it is affecting their mental and physical healthMorrison is one of 189 temporary accommodation residents who have been moved on to Love Lane during the last three years while Haringey council hammers out the details of the scheme with the developer, Lendlease. They have been placed there as a stop-gap as the council struggles to house the 10,000 people on its social homes waiting list, yet as temporary accommodation residents, none of them are guaranteed a home in the new scheme.“You see the brand new stadium on one side, you see the brand new station on the other, and we’re in the middle,” Morrison says. “We don’t fit in and we know they’re going to get rid of us. We’re on edge every minute.”Across London, local authorities have moved hundreds of homeless families on to council estates that are planned for demolition, where they live in limbo in deteriorating conditions. Many report that living in such uncertainty has had an impact on their mental health, citing issues such as sleep deprivation and anxiety, as well as physical health complaints connected to the poor maintenance of such estates, says Peter Elliott, a Green councillor in the Gipsy Hill ward of Lambeth. Green councillors are calling for an immediate halt to such regeneration schemes to give residents certainty, regardless of their status.“There is this gross inequality for people in temporary accommodation,” says Elliott, who lives on the Central Hill estate that has been slated for demolition since 2014. “Years from telling people their estates are getting demolished, the housing has been falling into disrepair, there are faulty electrics and lighting, walkways are treacherous and sewers are backing up. If it was anyone else those responsible would be branded rogue landlords. These are vulnerable people and councils are abusing them.”Lambeth council has 2,376 homeless households in temporary accommodation, including 156 on what it calls “regeneration estates”. Among them are Danielle Montrose-Francis and her 10-year-old son, who were moved on to the Central Hill estate in March. By this point they had been homeless for four years after the landlord of their privately rented home evicted them under section 21, which allows a landlord to evict a tenant without giving a reason. The family were unable to afford private rented accommodation in the area and became homeless, sleeping on other people’s sofas and in B\u0026ampBs.Since they moved to the Central Hill estate, they have faced a severe mouse infestation, antisocial behaviour from neighbours and holes in the door and the walls. The cramped conditions and rodents mean that Montrose-Francis has been sharing her bed with her son, who was so stressed at one point that his hair was falling out.“Since we were evicted it’s been like a nightmare that we haven’t woken up from yet,” says Montrose-Francis, who is working part time in a church while she starts her own chemical-free cleaning business. “It’s a kind of discrimination. One group gets help with housing and their needs are acknowledged, but when you are in temporary accommodation it feels like you are punished for being poor.”Lambeth council says any disrepair on these estates is not related to their use as temporary accommodation. A spokesperson said: “These properties provide low-cost local housing for homeless households who might otherwise have to be accommodated in more expensive accommodation further away. They are entitled to the same services as secure council tenants on the estates regarding issues such as repairs and complaints of antisocial behaviour.”The Green party is calling for the repair and refurbishment of council estates rather than the sale of land to private developers to build private housing. Lambeth Council responded that its estate redevelopments are carried out by Homes for Lambeth, an independent company wholly owned by the council.When a building is demolished, energy is used to deconstruct it and remove, process and dispose of the waste. Building a replacement requires a further commitment of energy and materials.“Councils should be maintaining the existing estates as council flats, which reduces the pressure on the housing list,” says Siân Berry, co-leader of the Green party. She wants demands for regeneration on these estates to be permanently halted. “Residents are being moved out to private rented homes or other council flats and temporary residents are being moved in, sometimes for up to a decade, so the whole system just keeps getting worse.”Morrison co-chairs a tenants’ group called Temporary Accommodation Group, which is campaigning for the 189 families in temporary accommodation on Love Lane to be given permanent social homes at social rent in Haringey. “I’m not against regeneration, but people shouldn’t be put on a demolition site on purpose,” she says.• This story was amended on 4 November 2019 to add a clarification from Lambeth Council.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69c0d7ad8a3eb9accd36dbef1525fe0ed05ea8c3/0_364_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=627f6c342987829fbe366947c03bb92a","title":"britain divided hung parliament proportional representation","story":"Goodbye to this most remarkable of parliaments, dissolving all too aptly on Guy Fawkes night. For all the extremes of abuse hurled at them, it has harboured the bravest and best MPs, who have broken ranks to defend the country against a Brexit disaster, putting conscience and honour before party, tribe or personal career. This departing Commons should be remembered as the parliament of conscience.These MPs were fortunate in a Speaker who rose to the great constitutional crisis with the vision and effrontery to break traditions, to protect parliament’s sovereignty against an overreaching executive. With no Commons majority, Theresa May and Boris Johnson summoned unprecedented Henry VIII powers to try to sneak in shedloads of crucial legislation by statutory instrument, without votes. If taking back control was the purpose of Brexit, John Bercow seized it on behalf of citizens.Even more momentous, an unprecedented 89 MPs left their parties, voluntarily or ejected. Johnson the autocrat purged 21 of his moderate MPs, including distinguished ex-chancellors and brightest sparks, causing most of their One Nation club to stand down tomorrow. Remember that purge whenever Johnson poses as a one-nationer.This parliament, says Gavin Freeguard of the Institute for Government, has seen its greatest cracking of the parties: only 28 Labour MPs split to form the SDP in 1981. If Change UK defectors were disappointed that their defections didn’t set off a system-breaking avalanche, their insignificance did act as a deterrent: our abominable first-past-the-post system grinds up most who dare leave the rigid bondage of the two-and-half main English parties. Tory rebels Dominic Grieve or Anna Soubry standing as independents in their old seats defy gigantic odds. But in a fair voting system, it shouldn’t be so.Shining lights in this departing parliament include many such as Oliver Letwin, who defied their parties to ensure a vote on the great question of our generation. How shaming it looks that May initially wanted to Brexit with no Commons vote on her final deal. Rebellions on all sides were driven by conscience: Mark Francois and his European Research Group are greeted as “raving lunatics” by those they in turn dub “remainiacs”, but there’s no doubting their sincerity. Nobody could accuse those such as Caroline Flint – who choose to obey their leave constituents – of a lack of conviction.However, any parliament has its quota of bounders and greasy pole-vaulters: Matt Hancock and Jeremy Hunt swivelled from remain to hardest leave in their leadership bids. Too many Tory remainers stayed silent, imposing on the country a leader they know is unfit, hoping Johnson will save their jobs. Some Labour shadow spokespeople, with their eye on post-Corbyn times, parrot a party line on Brexit neutrality they can’t possibly believe – though bolder voices loudly proclaim for remain against orders.With Scotland gone, psephologists judge a hung parliament the best Labour can hope for – and a good thing, too. Compromise and negotiation between parties in hung parliaments is a better path, given the ided country. An outright majority for Johnson is a terrifying prospect – free to do anything, with his party’s moderates purged, despite only minority support.Labour’s leadership could add electoral reform to the party manifesto and trounce critics by proving themselves to be open democrats, not tight party conspirators – willing to collaborate with others. (Since Lib Dems would make it inevitable, why not take the credit?) John McDonnell is just one of Labour’s many proportional representation supporters. The Hansard Society warns: “The public reputation of parliament and MPs is at a nadir.” The best hope is for a hung parliament – and a new Speaker brave enough to encourage a convention on voting reform."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4940c99d9f6ffac360800ee3713a12538dc2142d/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1966e8b33f9b079e19aeae072f8ca40b","title":"the guardian view on labours radical plans fix the economy and democracy","story":"Labour aims to radically transform Britain it is a change that is long overdue. The public are quite rightly fed up with the idea that an economic bloodletting is a necessary purgative after the excesses of a boom. Labour recognised this in 2017 and reaped the benefit. Since then, the Tories have sought to claim that they have fixed the economy – and therefore they can go some way to matching Labour’s spending pledges, at least in the election campaign. If ending austerity means ditching self-imposed fiscal targets, Boris Johnson reasons, so be it.Yet the public is entitled to ask why the state was in so many areas deliberately rolled back, reducing aggregate demand when the economy would have benefited from it. The result was an immiseration of ordinary people and the forced decay of the public realm. This did not bother the Conservatives when they were winning elections. It was a political decision taken because the Tories have been running the economy for the benefit of rentier capitalists, those privileged iniduals and businesses whose market and political power allows them to extract a great deal of rent – that is cash – from everybody else. A seminal study by Brett Christophers on this form of capitalism, which has been growing for decades with the rise of finance and the decline of manufacturing, described every one of the top 30 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange as a rentier.The Conservatives will make a mistake if they just offer voters targeted sops and self-serving arguments that there has been something redemptive about the economic suffering imposed on the country. That is why Jeremy Corbyn’s attack on the “tax dodgers, dodgy landlords, bad bosses and big polluters” ought not to be dismissed. UK inequality is at a damagingly high level and the system is being rigged in favour of politically connected wealthy interests. Politicians need to realise that it is not just the economy that is at stake if they do not act – they are risking our democracy too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f36b8341cc0c484197eb663efd7f474e16970e17/157_0_2843_1706/master/2843.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b3b4eed4e5d4fc0c6e356da6c8c2010","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of silence","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘silence’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘silence’.Share your photos of what silence means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 6 November at 10am.

His meaning was clear: in a familiar, wilful and tiresome confusion of race and place, he was disoriented by the multiracial and multicultural nature of Britain’s capital.For his own peace of mind and ossified sense of nostalgia, Cleese should steer clear of Tate Britain for a while. Because next week, the artist and film-maker Steve McQueen’s Year 3 will open there – a display of school photographs from almost two-thirds of London’s primaries. There they stand: more than 3,000 photographs, showing about 76,000 children. The project’s photographers have captured the full range of the capital’s seven- and eight-year-old citizenry: from state, private, religious and special education schools, uniformed, non-uniformed, daffy grins, big ears, long braids, scuffed shoes, ironed headscarves and wild afros.In a sense, that is precisely the effect McQueen, 50, wants the exhibition to have, even if he takes visitors on a different journey from Cleese’s. “It’s a telescope and microscope situation,” he says. “You’re looking through a telescope and seeing all these people, but it’s also reflecting back on you, making you think: ‘Who am I in all of this?’ It’s exciting and dynamic. I hope the people and the powers that be are aware of that potential and reap from it. I find it very inspiring. The future is in those pictures. There’s going to be the criminal, the banker and the person who may not make it to 21. They are all there.”Getting them there was no small feat. “We spent a year and a half trying to work out how to do it,” says Clarrie Wallis, the exhibition’s curator. “Very early on it became clear that you couldn’t just do a callout to all the schools in London. There were issues like safeguarding that came into play. We had to make sure we had in place something that was robust and appropriate.”They needed the consent of every child’s parent or . Some schools had the will but not the wherewithal. As fantastic an opportunity as it was, this was one more demand on a system that was understaffed and overstretched. “Some schools felt they didn’t have the time or the capacity,” says Wallis. “A lot of them are under-resourced anyway and the arts programmes get squeezed.”So the Tate had to work out an “offer”, providing arts-based workshops with the help of A New Direction, an organisation that specialises in creative work within schools. Facilitators and photographers went into schools to do various exercises with children that related to the broader project.Every year 3 class that took part has been invited to come and see its photograph in the exhibition. Again, this is no small undertaking, involving everything from employing greeters to usher the children around, including a small tour of the Tate, to portable buildings in the car park where they can eat their lunch. “It’s an opportunity for us to champion why creativity matters,” says Wallis. “The hope is that they come, they’ll fall in love with us and want to come back again.” When the exhibition is over the schools will be given the framed photographs.There is something about the simplicity of the concept that makes the exhibition mesmerising. Row upon row of classic school photographs, all taken with the same format. The teacher in the centre, set back slightly into the class – embedded into their brood – with the teaching assistants towards the back and to the side. Where the class is larger, the front row sits on the floor cross-legged, the second row is on chairs and all the rest are standing up. “We had the photographers all stand a certain distance away, to allow for the variation in the size of classes,” explains Wallis, pointing out that while some classes could go up to 34 children, others, particularly in schools for children with special educational needs, might number eight or nine. However big or small the class, all the children are shown at roughly the same size. All were shot with natural light.The effect of this rigorous consistency in form is to draw out the difference in content. The pictures were taken wherever the school chose to accommodate them – in gyms and classrooms, under basketball nets, with backdrops of climbing bars, the Virgin Mary, blackboards and artwork. There was little retouching – chipped walls remained chipped.“I love that fact that there’s a similarity,” says McQueen. “Everyone is regimented in the same way. There’s conformity. But there’s inidualism, too. Each one is an inidual. They’re trying to make you conform. But, at the same time, there’s still that spark there, that iniduality, that questioning.”This tension, between the energy of the child at this stage of their development and the demands of the system, at this point in the process, McQueen finds particularly intriguing.“It’s this moment, when things have almost become regimented, just before they have to conform. It’s not that you lose them,” he says. “But it’s a whirlwind and they have to stand up in it. And the ones that can’t stand up often get chopped down and disregarded. And at the same time those that can also try to sustain a bit of themselves within that system. So you see the potential and possibility in these kids’ lives.”The initial idea, he says, came from his own experience of primary school, which he remembers as a time of wonder, boundless energy and fearless freedom. “It was incredible. The friends I had, and the potential, the possibilities. Playing, drawing, the kinship of friends, experimenting, getting wet in the rain. I had the chance to daydream. But then you think of what could have happened and where people I knew had gone to.”The whole thing makes for quite the rabbit hole. You start by looking at a picture, your eye drawn to the biggest smile, the tallest kid, the goofiest look or the teacher at the centre, who collectively offer a less erse demographic than the children (they are mostly women), but are varied nonetheless. You scan that class, then another, then another, thinking of how unlike your own school they are, or how similar, and before long you are reaching back to yourself at that age. To how big things were and how small your world was. Trying to remember who your teacher was, or your best friend, or your arch-enemy. Recalling the more troubled kids and wondering what happened to them. What happened to any of them. Some might be grandparents by now some could be millionaires.I have scant memories of class photo days, but I remember the sequence of events that made them unique to me and my family. The teachers would give us a letter to take home saying the photographer would be in on a certain day. I would lose it or forget it. I would generally be scruffy (that was and still is ‘“my look”), my hair a mass of tangles and knots.When the photos came back, I was always easily identifiable. I am the same age as McQueen but grew up in Stevenage in Hertfordshire and was generally the only black kid in the class. I would take the picture home and this would be the first my mum would know that a picture had been taken. She would hit the roof, pointing out how my dishevelment shamed her, sigh, and then say, “I like this one” and remark on my dimples or say I had my father’s smile. She would buy a ridiculous number to “send home” to Barbados and they would take their place along with the dresses, fabric, trousers and linen she hoarded for the same purpose and that never made the journey.For McQueen, who has two children, it is also a love letter to the city where he was born and raised. He has spent much of the last two decades in Amsterdam, but loves London. “I need this city because it’s given me so much,” he says. “It’s given me my belief system. It’s given me my viewpoint on life.”It hasn’t always loved him back. As McQueen progressed through the secondary system during the early 80s, he felt the walls closing, seeking to bury that sense of possibility under the dead weight of institutional racism. Simultaneously laughing and shaking his head, he mentions Tam Joseph’s painting UK School Report, which consists of three portraits side by side. The first, of a black youth in school blazer and tie, with a neat afro, is captioned: “Good at Sports” the second youth is funkier, slightly older with twists and an earring, and reads: “Likes music.” The last has long locks and an open shirt above the words: “Needs surveillance.” “By the time I got into high school things had definitely changed,” says McQueen.This is partly why he chose year 3. It is at seven or eight, he says, that children start to shed their solipsism and navigate the structures that shape their world. “It’s a limbo. It’s the first time these things are being introduced to them like race, class and gender. How do they grapple with that? I don’t know.”If that is a challenge for the kids, it is also a challenge for London. With the interview over, McQueen – a man of few, well-chosen words – circles back to finish a thought. “This is the future. They have to make it work. They don’t really have a choice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b188bbdba2a6ecafeb58beda379c1cddc9d4e8ab/0_0_2280_1368/master/2280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=897ab869cbf269473e3483372f37bd20","title":"restoring jamaicas lost coral reefs photo essay","story":"by Christina Larson. Photographs by David J Phillip and David GoldmanAPEverton Simpson squints at the Caribbean from his motorboat, scanning the dazzling bands of colour for hints of what lies beneath. Emerald green indicates sandy bottoms. Sapphire blue lies above seagrass meadows. And deep indigo marks coral reefs. That is where he is heading. He steers the boat to an unmarked spot he knows as the “coral nursery”. Simpson started working as a “coral gardener” two years ago as part of grassroots efforts to bring Jamaica’s coral reefs back from the brink.On the ocean floor, small coral fragments dangle from suspended ropes. Simpson and other ers tend to this underwater nursery as gardeners look after a flower bed, painstakingly plucking off snails and fireworms that feast on immature coral. When each stub grows to about the size of a human hand, Simpson collects them in his crate to inidually transplant on to a reef. Even fast-growing coral species add just a few inches a year.A few hours later, at a site called Dickie’s Reef, Simpson es again and uses bits of fishing line to tie clusters of staghorn coral on to rocky outcroppings, a temporary binding until the coral’s limestone skeleton grows and fixes itself on to the rock. The goal is to jumpstart the natural growth of a coral reef. And, so far, it is working.With fish and coral, it is a co-dependent relationship. The fish rely on the reef structure to evade danger and lay eggs, and also eat up the coral’s rivals. When too many fish disappear, the coral suffers, and vice versa.The delicate labour of the coral gardener is only one part of restoring a reef and for all its intricacy it is actually the most straightforward part. Convincing lifelong fishermen to curtail when and where they fish and controlling the surging waste dumped into the ocean are trickier endeavours.Slowly, the comeback effort is gaining momentum. “The coral are coming back, the fish are coming back,” says Stuart Sandin, a marine biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. “It’s probably some of the most vibrant coral reefs we’ve seen in Jamaica since the 1970s. When you give nature a chance, she can repair herself. It’s not too late.”Sandin is studying the health of coral reefs around the world as part of a research project called the 100 Island Challenge. His starting assumption was that the most populated islands would have the most degraded habitats, but what he found instead was that humans can be either a blessing or a curse, depending on how they manage resources.In Jamaica, more than a dozen grassroots-run coral nurseries and fish sanctuaries have sprung up in the past decade, supported by small grants from foundations, local businesses such as hotels and scuba clinics, and the Jamaican government.At White River, which is only about two years old and where Simpson works, the clearest proof of early success is the return of tropical fish that inhabit the reefs, as well as hungry pelicans, skimming the surface of the water to feed on them.Jamaica’s coral reefs were once among the world’s most celebrated, with their golden branching structures and resident brightly coloured fish drawing the attention of travellers from Christopher Columbus to Ian Fleming, who wrote most of his James Bond novels on the island’s northern coast in the 1950s and 1960s.In 1965, the country became the site of the first global research hub for coral reefs, the Discovery Bay Marine Lab, now associated with the University of the West Indies. The groundbreaking marine biologist couple Thomas and Nora Goreau completed fundamental research here, including describing the symbiotic relationship between coral and algae and pioneering the use of scuba equipment for marine studies. The same lab also provided a vantage point as the coral disappeared.Peter Gayle has been a marine biologist at Discovery Bay since 1985. From the yard outside his office, he points towards the reef crest about 300 metres (985ft) away, a thin brown line splashed with white waves. “Before 1980, Jamaica had healthy coral,” he says. Then several disasters struck.The first calamity was 1980’s Hurricane Allen, one of the most powerful cyclones in recorded history. “Its 40ft waves crashed against the shore and basically chewed up the reef,” Gayle says. Coral can grow back after natural disasters but only when given a chance to recover, which it never got.“There was a tipping point in the 1980s, when it switched from being a coral-dominated system to being an algae-dominated system,” Gayle says. “Scientists call it a ‘phase shift’.”That seemed like the end of the story until an unlikely alliance started to tip the ecosystem back in the other direction, with help from residents such as Simpson and his fellow fisherman Lipton Bailey.The fishing community of White River revolves around a small boat-docking area about a quarter of a mile from where the river flows into the Caribbean Sea. One early morning, as purple dawn light filters into the sky, Simpson and Bailey step on to a 28ft motorboat called the Interceptor.Both men have lived and fished their whole lives in the community. Recently, they have come to believe that they need to protect the coral reefs that attract tropical fish, while setting limits on fishing to ensure the sea is not emptied too quickly.In the White River area, the solution was to create a protected area, a “fish sanctuary”, for immature fish to grow and reach reproductive age before they are caught.Two years ago, the fishermen joined with local businesses, including hotel owners, to form a marine association and negotiate the boundaries for a no-fishing zone stretching two miles along the coast. A simple line in the water is hardly a deterrent however, to make the boundary meaningful, it must be enforced. Today, the local fishermen, including Simpson and Bailey, take turns patrolling the boundary in the Interceptor.On this morning, the men steer the boat just outside a row of orange buoys marked “no fishing”. ‘‘We are looking for violators,” Bailey says, his eyes trained on the rocky coast. “Sometimes you find spearmen. They think they’re smart. We try to beat them at their game.”Most of the older and more established fishermen, who own boats and set out lines and wire cages, have come to accept the no-fishing zone. Besides, the risk of having their equipment confiscated is too great. But not everyone is on board. Some younger men hunt with lightweight spearguns, swimming out to sea and firing at close-range. These men, some of them poor and with few options, are the most likely trespassers.The patrols carry no weapons, so they must master the art of persuasion. “Let them understand this. It’s not a ‘you’ thing or a ‘me’ thing. This isn’t personal,” Bailey says of past encounters with violators.These are sometimes risky efforts. Two years ago, Jerlene Layne, a manager at nearby Boscobel fish sanctuary, ended up in hospital with a bruised leg after being attacked by a man she had reprimanded for fishing illegally. “He used a stick to hit my leg because I was doing my job, telling him he cannot fish in the protected area,” she says.Layne believes her work would be safer with more formal support from the police, but she is not going to stop. “Public mindsets can change,” she says. “If I back down on this, what kind of message does that send? You have to stand for something.”She has pressed charges in court against repeat trespassers, typically resulting in a fine and the confiscation of equipment.One such violator is Damian Brown, 33, who lives in a coastal neighbourhood called Stewart Town. Sitting outside on a concrete staircase near his modest home, Brown says fishing is his only option for work and he believes the sanctuary boundaries extend too far.Back at the White River docking area, Rick Walker, a 35-year-old spear fisherman, is cleaning his motorboat. He remembers the early opposition to the fish sanctuary, when many people said they were trying to stop their livelihood.Two years later, Walker, who is not involved in running the sanctuary but supports its boundary, says he can see the benefits. “It’s easier to catch snapper and barracuda,” he says. “At least my great-grandkids will get to see some fish.”When Columbus landed in Jamaica he sailed into Oracabessa Bay, which is today a 20-minute drive from the mouth of the White River. Oracabessa Bay fish sanctuary was the first of the grassroots-led efforts to revive Jamaica’s coral reefs. Its sanctuary was legally incorporated in 2010 and its approach of enlisting local fishermen as patrols became a model for other regions.“The fishermen are mostly on board and happy, that’s the distinction. That’s why it’s working,” says the sanctuary manager, Inilek Wilmot.David Murray, the head of the Oracabessa Fishers’ Association, notes that Jamaica‘s 60,000 fishermen operate without a safety net. “Fishing is like gambling, it’s a game. Sometimes you catch something, sometimes you don’t,” he says. When fish populations began to collapse two decades ago, something had to change.Murray now works as a warden in the Oracabessa sanctuary, while continuing to fish outside its boundary. He also spends time explaining the concept to neighbours.“It’s people work, it’s a process to get people to agree on a sanctuary boundary,” he says. “It’s a tough job to tell a man who’s been fishing all his life that he can’t fish here.”But once it became clear that a no-fishing zone actually helped nearby fish populations rebound, it became easier to build support. The number of fish in the sanctuary has doubled between 2011 and 2017, and the inidual fish have grown larger, nearly tripling in length on average, according to annual surveys by Jamaica’s national environment and planning agency. And that boosts catches in surrounding areas. After word got out about Oracabessa, other regions wanted advice.“We have the data to show success but even more important than data is word of mouth,” says Wilmot, who oversaw training to help start the fish sanctuary at White River.Morrow, a lifelong water sports enthusiast often seen paddle-boarding with her dog, Shadow, runs the White River Marine Association. She attends fishers’ meetings and raises small grants from the Jamaican government and other foundations to support equipment purchases and coral replanting campaigns.“We all depend on the ocean,” Morrow says, sitting in a small office decorated with nautical maps in the 70-year-old Jamaica Inn. “If we don’t have a good healthy reef and a good healthy marine environment, we will lose too much. Too much of the country relies on the sea.”This Associated Press feature was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s department of science education.

So when Juventus, the Italian home of Cristiano Ronaldo and Gianluigi Buffon, invited the brand to design their 20192020 season kit, it was a dream come true. “It was amazing and crazy,” says Tanju. “They are an iconic football team and have some of my favourite players.”Palace has long graduated from Tanju’s basement still independent, it now has four stand-alone stores, concessions in Dover Street Market, and a reported turnover of £25m. it is a skate brand that sells streetwear, turning it out in weekly “drops”, responding to its customers’ appetite for newness and novelty (while also giving rise to a healthy cottage industry in the re-sale market). Its in-house style is irreverent and often pokes fun at the fashion system that it is, nevertheless, a part of, having collaborated with Ralph Lauren, Adidas, Jean-Charles de Castelbajac and Reebok. A partnership on this level – a 10-year-old skate brand and one of the oldest and greatest Serie A football teams has never taken place before. It’s both brave unexpected, yet there is an authenticity to it. Palace is unique in the way it is positioned– cool, underground and elusive, but with the oomph of brand 10 times it’s size. It is hard to imagine any other label pulling this collaboration off.The collection for Juventus includes three kits in two different colour ways, two tracksuits, a jacket, training tops, baseball caps, a beanie, a sports bag, gloves, scarves and a football (which, sadly, won’t be used in games). The on-pitch kit has Juventus’s iconic stripes fading into an eye-melting op-art black-and-white check, punctuated with the sponsor’s logos in fluorescent green. It nods to the fact that the British football fan’s style was inspired by Italian brands from the 1980s, and sits on the intersectional point for skatewear, football and leisure culture. “The design process was really working out how to make it Juventus, but with a Palace edge – a bit wonky and crazy,” says Tanju. “Our designer, Nugget, brought a lot to the table, referencing 90s football gear, beanies and bag.”The small team at Palace is closer than family, and they all love what they do, says Tanju. “I’ve known my business partner for 20 years I used to skate with him,” he says. “There’s no guy in a suit looking over our shoulders saying we can’t do something because it didn’t sell. We make things we want to make.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e52c02f01313249bce22335f7d8efacdedc4ecaf/0_36_1816_1090/master/1816.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edd7a5d30c98522048058cbc9a9ab34c","title":"julie delpy ethan hawke how we made before sunrise trilogy sunset midnight","story":"‘Remembering that much dialogue was torture’The original script for the first film, Before Sunrise, was believe it or not kind of devoid of romance – even though Richard Linklater, the director, had based it on a woman he spent the night walking around Philadelphia with. It was a great blueprint, but it was even more cerebral and talky. He was keen to capture something very true, so wanted the two leads to be writers on the film as well – and he auditioned us about what we wanted to say. I talked about some stuff that ended up in the film, about God existing in the space between people.So Richard, Ethan and I produced the script together, though Ethan and I weren’t credited for Before Sunrise. The process was totally collaborative: all three of us had to agree on ideas for scenes. That’s how we did Before Sunset and Before Midnight, too. If one of us hated something, it wouldn’t make the film. From the start, those guys wanted the balance of a proper female voice. The writing was still going on during the shoot in Vienna for example, that’s when I wrote the scene in which my character Céline makes a mock phone call to a friend and announces she’s in love with Jesse.Remembering that much dialogue was torture – and it was even worse with the longer takes on Before Sunset, which I had suggested doing in real time. I had been going through a bit of a difficult time in the early 00s, struggling to make films as a director and I’d had some health issues. But it wasn’t directly autobiographical: like the director Krzysztof Kieślowski once told me, you take a seed of truth and make it a tree. I had thought of the ending, where I imitate Nina Simone and tell Jesse he’s going to miss his plane, for another film I’d written. I performed it for Richard and he loved it. I wasn’t sure I wanted to give it away, but I thought: this series is more important than some film of mine I might never do. These films speak to everyone, from adolescence to the end of life they’re not just about generation X. Really young people now even like Before Sunrise because they see their parents in Jesse and Céline. You see Ethan and I getting older as the series progresses. The films are really a study of time.I’d been going through a really hard time with my orce, so that summer in Paris shooting Before Sunset was extremely healing, reconnecting with Richard and Julie. She and I had done a little cameo as Jesse and Céline in Richard’s 2001 animated feature Waking Life, and we started daydreaming about how we could make another movie together.A little later, Richard turned up to a book signing I was doing in Austin and had a flash of an idea: what if Jesse had written a book about Céline, and she turned up to the signing? There’s definitely something autobiographical in that opening exchange at the bookshop about using your own life to create art – and what the value of that is. You never really find the answers, but there’s a healthy healing process that comes from asking certain questions, and I hope the film asks them of me.The third film, Before Midnight, was the hardest to make because the first two are about romantic projection. I felt it was important to do a corresponding film that was grounded in reality and the nature of love on a day-to-day basis. Could we make a film about a couple who’ve been together for years and raised kids, but still have it be romantic, without telling one lie? We weren’t sure the audience would like it – you wouldn’t want to see a sequel to Titanic with Jack and Rose fighting.The structure was very challenging, too. We wanted to do a Bergman, like Scenes from a Marriage, with a sequence that starts off as a love scene, but ends in them possibly breaking up. So writing that climactic marital row scene was one of the most difficult things I’ve ever done 30 pages, without being boring, in one single room is tough. But it works as a complete circle: the way Before Sunrise starts is this couple in their 40s fighting on the train. We realised as we filmed it: “Wow, we’ve become that couple.”So there’s something about the trilogy that feels finished to me. Every time we make one of them, the stakes get higher. We wouldn’t want to pour any water in our beer. Which isn’t to say we couldn’t revisit Jesse and Céline we muse on it sometimes. A fourth film would have to work in some way that broke the rhythm of this cycle, maybe to address mortality. But these three films have been a blessing in my life.• The Before Trilogy is out now on Criterion Collection Blu-ray."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cae210982f38f4401e006213f97b58fb025827b/0_72_2161_1297/master/2161.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=201e802b2be5e234e295d98c90fb15c4","title":"spurs everton andre gomes sheffield united football weekly podcast","story":"Faye Carruthers, Barry Glendenning, Gregg Bakowski and Lars Sivertsen discuss André Gomes’s injury, the tears of Son, successful dribblers, Sheffield United’s success, Leicester’s centre-backs and contact lensesJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

They live in a home they built together in the Chilean wildernessAs a keen environmentalist, Paul Coleman has travelled the world, walking vast distances to plant trees and raise awareness about climate change. At the end of 2004, he had just finished a walk in Japan when he met Konomi Kikuchi. “I was giving a presentation that was being translated into Japanese for the audience,” he says. “I noticed she was laughing at my jokes before the translation.”Konomi, a writer, says she was inspired by the Briton’s mission to spread the message about the environment. The author of 11 books, she was keen to write about Paul and his life’s work on her blog. Shortly afterwards, Konomi’s editor read her blogpost and asked her to write a book about Paul. To celebrate its publication at the 2005 Expo in Nagoya, he planned to walk round the island of Okinawa. “I was fascinated by his character,” Konomi says. “So I asked if I could go with him on part of his trip.”They ended up spending a week together. “I discovered that he has a great sense of humour and a big heart. He is so passionate about nature and the planet. It made me rethink the way I had been living my life.”Konomi loved exploring the outdoors. By the end of the week, Paul had fallen in love with her. “I realised her whole personality was wonderful. She’s very giving and has such a loving nature. She’s the whole package.”Konomi had recently come out of a relationship and wasn’t sure if she was ready for something new. “Paul was happy to take things slowly – or just be friends if that was what I wanted. He accepted me for who I was.”This acceptance encouraged her to take the plunge and their relationship progressed quickly. In September 2005, they were married in Japan. Several months later, Paul was invited by the Earth Day movement to take part in a three-month walk around China, Korea and Japan. “The trip was designed to unite the Earth Day movements in those three countries and send a message of goodwill,” he says. “We started at the Great Wall of China in January in temperatures of –15C, which was extremely challenging for Konomi.”She says she almost gave up but Paul encouraged her to persevere. “I was carrying all my makeup and cosmetics, which was making it even harder. Eventually, he persuaded me to ditch them to make my bag lighter. I’ve never worn makeup since!”When they married, Paul had promised that they would find the “most beautiful place in the world” to live. In 2007, they bought some land in Aysén, a remote area of Patagonia in Chile. Accessible only by ferry and five hours from the nearest city, the region is surrounded by glaciers and forests. “From the first moment, I fell in love with it,” says Konomi.Over the next few years, the couple built a home from scratch. “There is no road to the house so we carried all the materials on our backs,” says Paul. “It was his idea to build the house but I had total faith in him,” says Konomi. “If he could walk round the world, he could make this happen.”To create the sustainable lifestyle they dreamed of, the couple planted more than 1,000 native trees and built terraces, greenhouses and ponds to collect rainwater. Food is sourced from their land and they get fresh water from the stream. The couple now use their expertise to support local community projects. “We are trying to create a fully sustainable local economy,” says Paul. “At the moment a lot of food is imported, so it travels for many miles. If there’s a storm and supplies are cut off it means there is no food.”They have made plenty of friends there and enjoy exploring Patagonia in their spare time. “Every day is an adventure. It’s like living in a 1,000km national park,” says Paul. “Konomi and I are together for 24 hours a day but we are best friends. We have a wonderful life.”Want to share your story?

At a sold-out Wembley arena, the triumphant tone is set early: a curtain drops and a colossal gorilla is revealed. When its jaw slowly opens, Burna Boy is revealed on its tongue.Strapped into a harness, he glides through the air from its open mouth to the tip of the stage. Microphone in hand and the crowd screaming under his feet, stretching their fingers to the sky, he moans the uplifting lyrics to the title track from his 2019 album African Giant: “Tell ’em Africa we don’t tire!”Other tracks from the album are as enchanting as his introduction. Over 19 songs he mixes Afrobeats rhythms with influences that  R\u0026ampB and reggae, a blend that is making him the genre’s first global breakout star. Accompanied by a live band and choir, the gig has the feeling of a coronation of Nigeria’s latest musical king.Killin Dem is captivating, the jittery drums and choppy vocal delivery creating mosh-pit circles like craters across the arena. When Burna Boy screams “Gbese!” during the hook, the craters collapses in on themselves, and 12,000 people vigorously jerk their shoulders to the scattergun percussion, resembling a mass synchronised swimming routine. Burna Boy has elegance, grace and charisma, a magnetic aura that follows him like a shadow he dances as if music vibrates in his bones, and gives his vocals a deep, raspy croon.Special guests add gloss to the evening and show how highly he is regarded. There is an appearance from Burna’s fellow Afrobeats titan Wizkid Dave sprints to the stage to spar over their summer anthem Location, and Stormzy marches out for a fervent delivery of Vossi Bop, exchanging a long hug with Burna. The evening ends with Ye, the song that has spearheaded Afrobeats’ global expansion, its soft, enticing drums and echoing, easy hook digestible for ears from all continents. He finds his groove amid the tender piano chords and leads the crowd into a hypnotic sermon, closing out a historic night for a true giant of African music.• At Albert Hall, Manchester, 6 November then touring the UK until 10 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49cfabc862f9df8bc11a5135f1dd43e67738268d/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=793e08b0a46a37962819589a0443f6cf","title":"facebook and google asked to suspend political ads before general election","story":"Letter calls for suspension until after vote due to lack of time to reform online advertising rulesThe UK does not have time to solve the problems of online political advertising before the general election, meaning it should be voluntarily suspended by Facebook and Google until after the vote, campaigners, academics and non-profits have said.In a letter addressed to Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, the chief executives of Facebook and Google, as well as Nick Clegg and Kent Walker, the heads of policy of the respective companies, the campaigners write that “with the announcement of the election coming in only six weeks, there is no time for regulations to catch up” with the reality of online advertising.“This legislative blackspot is particularly concerning in light of Facebook’s recent policies to allow politicians to openly publish disinformation through ads. Equally concerning is the lack of transparency as to what data is being used to target ads, and how such ads are being targeted,” they say.In the wake of the\u0026nbspCambridge Analytica scandal, there is a heightened sensitivity around the use of personal data in political campaigning.Facebook allows political parties to target you for adverts in\u0026nbspthree different ways. They can choose to show ads to people based on age, location, and interests. So, for example, you could choose to advertise to men aged 35-44 in Yorkshire. Or women aged 65+ that Facebook considers to be interested in a specific topic.Additionally, Facebook allows political parties to combine Facebook’s audience with existing data they have, such as phone numbers or email addresses, or people who have been tracked visiting a party’s website.Facebook also has a feature called “Lookalike Audiences”. It allows parties to try to target people who behave similarly on Facebook to those for whom they have contact details.As a result of controversy around political adverts on Facebook, the social media company introduced an\u0026nbspAd Library\u0026nbspwhere you can, in theory, see all the adverts being paid for by political parties, and a rough estimate of how much money has been spent, and the audiences they have been targeting.“As we prepare to enter purdah, and without proper legislation, we’re calling on you to take a stand and issue an immediate moratorium on all political and issue-based advertising on your platforms until the conclusion of the UK parliamentary elections on 12 December.”The letter, signed by representatives of seven organisations including Mozilla, Doteveryone, the Open Data Institute and Sheffield University, notes the decision to voluntarily pause political adverts is not without precedent.“Google blocked political advertising two weeks before polling day,” the letter says. “In the Israeli and Canadian elections, political ads were blocked outright for the duration of the election period.”Twitter has announced a voluntary suspension of all political adverts, with the chief executive, Jack Dorsey, writing: “It’s not credible for us to say: ‘We’re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, but if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad … well … they can say whatever they want’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13d5b8dd5ac94148b84acdc296695277b5986135/308_339_4946_2968/master/4946.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a83762364017175533982aeac5563c82","title":"no 10 blocks russia eu referendum report until after election","story":"No 10 refuses to clear release of report into Russian political interference before election Boris Johnson was on Monday night accused of presiding over a cover-up after it emerged that No 10 refused to clear the publication of a potentially incendiary report examining Russian infiltration in British politics, including the Conservative party.Downing Street indicated on Monday that it would not allow a 50-page dossier from the intelligence and security committee to be published before the election, prompting a string of complaints over its suppression.The committee’s chairman, Dominic Grieve, called the decision “jaw dropping”, saying no reason for the refusal had been given, while Labour and Scottish Nationalist party politicians accused No 10 of refusing to recognise the scale of Russian meddling.Fresh evidence has also emerged of attempts by the Kremlin to infiltrate the Conservatives by a senior Russian diplomat suspected of espionage, who spent five years in London cultivating leading Tories including Johnson himself.It can now be revealed that Sergey Nalobin – who once described the future prime minister as “our good friend” – lives in a Moscow apartment block known as the “FSB house” because it houses so many employees from the Kremlin’s main spy agency.The committee’s report is based on analysis from Britain’s intelligence agencies, as well as third-party experts such as former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, and is subject to a final clearance from Downing Street. That has to come before parliament is dissolved on Tuesday if it is to be released ahead of the election.Downing Street sources stated that was not now expected to happen in time, claiming the sign off process typically takes six weeks. A No 10 spokesman added: “There are processes reports such as this have to go through before publication, and the committee is well-informed of these.”However, it is understood the dossier has already been approved by the intelligence agencies themselves as part of a long clearance process that began in late March. Downing Street was sent a final draft on 17 October and had been expected to sign off the report by the end of last week.Grieve said “The protocols are quite clear. If the prime minister has a good reason for preventing publication he should explain to the committee what it is, and do it within 10 days of him receiving the report. If not, it should be published.”The dossier specifically examines Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 EU referendum. Members of the committee – which meets in secret because of the sensitivity of its work – had wanted to make recommendations to introduce greater safeguards ahead of the December poll.Ian Lucas, a Labour MP who sits on the culture media and sport select committee, which has conducted related inquiries into the conduct of the EU referendum said “the government needs to come clean about its view on Russian interference in British politics”.Ministers have argued that there are no examples of successful Russian interference in UK elections, but Lucas said that this needed to be properly tested: “This decision looks like it is designed to avoid proper scrutiny of what we actually know.”Allegations that Moscow money has flowed into the Conservative party via emigres living in the UK making high profile donations, were also heard by the committee – although the party has consistently denied receiving money improperly.In 2014, Lubov Chernukhin – the wife of the former Russian deputy finance minister – paid £160,000 to play tennis with Johnson and David Cameron. The match was the star lot at a Conservative summer party auction. Another guest at the 2013 fundraiser was Vasily Shestakov, Vladimir Putin’s judo partner.Committee members were also briefed on an extraordinary – and for a while an apparently successful – attempt to penetrate Conservative circles by Nalobin, who instigated a pro-Kremlin parliamentary group, the Conservative Friends of Russia.During his time in the UK, Nalobin went to exclusive Tory fundraising events and met senior Conservatives. In January 2014 he posed for a photograph with Johnson at an event at city hall in London. Nalobin posted it on Twitter, writing in a caption that the then mayor was “our good friend” who said “warm words” about Russians.Conservative Friends of Russia held its 2012 launch party in the Russian ambassador’s Kensington garden, with some 250 Russian and British guests present, including Tories who went on to play a prominent role in the referendum campaign. One was Matthew Elliott, now chief executive of pro-Brexit group Vote Leave, alongside Dominic Cummings, now the prime minister’s chief strategist.Another guest was Johnson’s future girlfriend Carrie Symonds, a Tory party activist. At the time she worked in the office of John Whittingdale, the pro-Brexit MP who was the group’s honorary vice-president. The group collapsed after revelations of Nalobin’s alleged ties with the Kremlin’s SVR foreign intelligence agency.Over the weekend, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, raised questions over Cummings’ connections to Russia, and the levels of security vetting to which he had been subject, after an official whistleblower raised concerns with her.Thornberry asked if Cummings had been asked about his relationship with members Conservative Friends of Russia, as well as the purpose of his three-year period of work in post-communist Russia between 1994 and 1997.Peers held a special debate about the withheld dossier, following an urgent question from the cross-bench peer Lord Anderson, a national security expert, who insisted the delay was unjustified. “It invites, I’m afraid, suspicion of the government and its motives,” he said.Lord Howe, responding for the government, told peers: “The length of time that the government had had for this report is not at all unusual. It was delivered on 17 October – that is not a very long time ago. And the prime minister is entitled to take his view on what the report contains.”Stewart McDonald, the SNP’s defence spokesman, said: “Parliament is about to be sent packing into a general election without fully understanding the extent to which Russia has meddled in our most recent democratic electoral events.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ff52571d561bdf5af3f4acecaaa23be6a8b76fb/0_123_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d5ed6bf92ba03214d4d08820d36bb7d","title":"sinn fein stand aside remain candidates three constituencies general election","story":"SDLP also promises to give other remain parties clear run against DUP in general electionSinn Féin will not run candidates in three of Northern Ireland’s 18 constituencies to boost the chances of other anti-Brexit candidates in next month’s election.The party announced on Monday it would stand aside in South Belfast, East Belfast and North Down to give pro-remain candidates an edge against Democratic Unionist party (DUP) candidates.“You can call this a pact. You can call it what you wish. The reality is that we’re asking people to come out and to vote for those pro-remain candidates,” said Mary Lou McDonald, the Sinn Féin leader.The announcement followed a similar promise hours earlier by the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) to stand aside in North Belfast, East Belfast and North Down.The pact could help Sinn Féin’s John Finucane take the North Belfast seat held by the DUP deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, help the SDLP’s Claire Hanna topple the DUP’s Emma Little-Pengelly in South Belfast, and help Lady Sylvia Hermon, an independent unionist MP, fend off a DUP challenge in North Down.McDonald said she had no problem urging Sinn Féin supporters to vote for Westminster’s only pro-remain unionist. “It sits very comfortably with me to ask and invite voters to thoughtfully do the right thing.”Pro-remain forces needed to unite to block reckless Brexiters, she said. “Whether you call yourself a unionist or a nationalist, a republican or a loyalist, we actually have many, many interests in common.”The SDLP said standing down in three constituencies was an “extraordinary decision” for an “extraordinary election”. “Our first priority is to elect pro-remain MPs to vote against Brexit and Boris Johnson but removing pro-Brexit MPs in Belfast is also critical.”The decision by both nationalist parties to stand down in East Belfast will bolster the effort by Naomi Long, the leader of the non-aligned Alliance party, to wrest the seat from the DUP. Few expect Alliance to reciprocate by standing down in South Belfast or North Down.Commentators said Brexit facilitated the Sinn FéinSDLP accord but that it was driven by raw electoral calculation. “It may be hung on remain vs leave, but the ‘pacts’ are just old-fashioned orange vs green,” said the commentator Alex Kane in the Belfast .Last week Steve Aiken, the pro-remain incoming leader of the Ulster Unionist party (UUP), briefly upended the greenorange convention by ruling out an electoral pact with the DUP, putting Dodds, an ardent Brexiter but fellow unionist, at risk.Aiken U-turned after unionists inside and outside the UUP protested and suspected loyalist paramilitaries threatened retaliation against his party. “It is better to elect Nigel Dodds in North Belfast and hold him to account for his promises on the union than facilitate the election of an abstentionist Sinn Féin MP who still cannot condemn IRA violence,” said Aiken.

The way we make decisions isn’t working. Our democratic system is in urgent need of renewal.“Power is too far away from people. We need the power to make changes in our lives and our communities. But too often we don’t know who can help or who is responsible.“Parliament and elections are stuck in the past. The structures and systems are in urgent need of an upgrade. And under the current electoral system too many voters are ignored.”The letter says Britain should learn from examples around the world and convene a citizens’ assembly, which should be given the best advice and the space to think through the challenges facing democracy.“This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create a democratic settlement that works for us all. It’s up to us,” it says.Others to endorse the letter include the Labour leader of Camden council, Georgia Gould, the human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, Alexandra Runswick of Unlock Democracy and the executive director of the Equality Trust, Dr Wanda Wyporska.The concept of a constitutional convention and a citizens’ assembly was used successfully in Ireland to examine the country’s biggest political issues.The assembly was composed of a chair and 99 citizens, randomly selected to be electorally representative. It met at weekends 12 times over 18 months, and considered five subjects: abortion, climate change, the ageing population, how referendums are conducted and fixed-term parliaments.

The election of a new Speaker should have been a relatively simple process. A straightforward elimination contest even an averagely dysfunctional organisation could probably have got wrapped up in a couple of hours. Tops.There were no last-minute backroom deals to be made by the candidates – “I’ll grant you a couple of urgent questions if you vote for me” – and it wasn’t even as if every MP was that bothered who won. Just 562 out of a possible 650 turned up for the first round of voting. But still somehow the Commons managed to make a meal of it.Twenty minutes for new ballot papers to be printed between each round because MPs couldn’t be trusted to remember who had already been eliminated moments earlier. Another 20 minutes to vote. Five minutes for the tellers to count the handful of votes and then 45 minutes to bugger about chatting in the tearooms. It was almost as if everyone was desperate to do anything but think about the general election.But all bad things come to an end and Lindsay Hoyle was finally duly elected. In line with tradition, the new Speaker was dragged to the chair. Labour’s Caroline Flint and Conservative Nigel Evans did the honours. Hoyle began by thanking his family and making a moving tribute to his daughter Natalie who had taken her own life in 2017. “She will always be missed,” he said. He went on to promise to make the house a model of tolerance and respect. We can always hope.Ken Clarke, the father of the house, had got proceedings under way with a genial mumble by inviting the seven candidates to give a five-minute stump speech to the Commons. Most followed much the same format. They were all definitely not going to be like the previous Speaker. Promises to be an umpire not a player. The sound of the clock being rewound was audible. Tock. Tick. Tock. Tick.In this particular election, Bercow was the new anti-Christ. To hint that anything he had done during his time in office might have been in any way progressive or of value was to risk instant elimination at the hands of grumpy Brexiters. Even when they were planning on continuing some of Bercow’s innovations, they were at pains to accentuate the differences. Doublespeak has seldom been so finessed.Rosie Winterton kicked things off by saying how she was determined to lower the temperature and keep statements and prime minister’s questions short. Unfortunately it took her well over a minute longer than her allotted five to say how brief she was going to be. Not the best of starts. Chris Bryant went out of his way to praise the intellect and sincerity of the house. No one would be more “Ever so ’umble” to serve. He also declared he would stamp out clapping in the chamber. Something that was greeted with a prolonged round of applause.It had always been a mystery why Edward Leigh had nominated himself. Not least to Leigh himself, as he is a man of little charm and to whom almost no one in the Commons looks up. His interventions usually inspire a mass exodus from the chamber. This time he was just heard in silence as he rambled inconsequentially about refurbishment. Meg Hillier also realised she was a rank outsider but was determined to go down in flames. She used her time to say there were many MPs who were bullies whom no one wanted to work for and everyone knew who they were. Yup. And they wouldn’t be voting for her.Eleanor Laing spoke with great theatricality – “Little Eleanor” she called herself – and her thinly disguised anti-Bercow diatribe ended in a whisper. Harriet Harman talked of all the different roles she had taken in the Commons and the importance of having a second woman as Speaker as she tried, unsuccessfully, to convince MPs that she wasn’t the continuity Bercow candidate. Hoyle spoke with the gravitas of a man who knew the job was his for the taking. He was the Man. There would be no emergency S024 debates or breaches with conventions on his watch, thank you very much. Brexit would be safe in his hands.The first ballot ended with Leigh and Hillier eliminated, having only scraped together 22 votes between them. After signing a few souvenir order papers for Tory MPs – look out for them on eBay later – Clarke looked hopefully towards the other candidates and invited them all to have a 10-minute think about whether they really wanted to prolong the agony. “Please, Rosie,” dozens of MPs muttered pleadingly. Winterton ignored them and pointedly walked out the other end of the chamber. Still five in it.A lifetime later and the results of the second ballot were counted. Winterton was out and Harman bowed to the inevitable and called it a day. Bercow-lite was never going to cut it. The thanks she got from the entire house was heartfelt. Then into an entirely new space-time continuum for the third vote. In which two MPs managed to spoil their ballot.

When Voyager 2, the longest-running space mission, crossed that frontier more than 40 years after its launch it sent a faint signal from the other side that scientists have now decoded.The Nasa craft is the second ever to travel beyond the heliosphere, the bubble of supersonic charged particles streaming outwards from the sun. Despite setting off a month ahead of its twin, Voyager 1, it crossed the threshold into interstellar space more than six years behind, after taking the scenic route across the solar system and providing what remain the only close-up images of Uranus and Neptune.Now Voyager 2 has sent back the most detailed look yet at the edge of our solar system – despite Nasa scientists having no idea at the outset that it would survive to see this landmark.“We didn’t know how large the bubble was and we certainly didn’t know that the spacecraft could live long enough to reach the edge of the bubble and enter interstellar space,” said Prof Ed Stone, of the California Institute of Technology, who has been working on the mission since before its launch in 1977.The heliosphere can be thought of as a cosmic weather front: a distinct boundary where charged particles rushing outwards from the sun at supersonic speed meet a cooler, interstellar wind blowing in from supernovae that exploded millions of years ago. It was once thought that the solar wind faded away gradually with distance, but Voyager 1 confirmed there was a boundary, defined by a sudden drop in temperature and an increase in the density of charged particles, known as plasma.The second set of measurements, by Voyager 2, give new insights into the nature of the heliosphere’s limits because on Voyager 1 a crucial instrument designed to directly measure the properties of plasma had broken in 1980.Measurements published in five separate papers in Nature Astronomy reveal that Voyager 2 encountered a much sharper, thinner heliosphere boundary than Voyager 1. This could be due to Voyager 1 crossing during a solar maximum (activity is currently at a low) or the craft itself might have crossed through on a less perpendicular trajectory that meant it ended up spending longer at the edge.The second data point also gives some insight into the shape of the heliosphere, tracing out a leading edge something like a blunt bullet.“It implies that the heliosphere is symmetric, at least at the two points where the Voyager spacecraft crossed,” said Bill Kurth, a University of Iowa research scientist and a co-author on one of the studies. “That says that these two points on the surface are almost at the same distance.”Voyager 2 also gives additional clues to the thickness of the heliosheath, the outer region of the heliosphere and the point where the solar wind piles up against the approaching wind in interstellar space, like the bow wave sent out ahead of a ship in the ocean.The data also feeds into a debate about the overall shape of the heliosphere, which some models predict ought to be spherical and others more like a wind sock, with a long tail floating out behind as the solar system moves through the galaxy at high speed.The shape depends, in a complex way, on the relative strengths of the magnetic fields inside and outside of the heliosphere, and the latest measurements are suggestive of a more spherical form.There are limits to how much can be gleaned from two data points, however.“It’s kind of like looking at an elephant with a microscope,” Kurth said. “Two people go up to an elephant with a microscope, and they come up with two different measurements. You have no idea what’s going on in between.”From beyond the heliosphere, the signal from Voyager 2 is still beaming back, taking more than 16 hours to reach Earth.

He sounded like a bemused lottery winner still attempting to compute how much his life had just changed.The heartfelt roar from the entire South Africa squad when Rassie Erasmus was announced as the world coach of the year was equally endearing. As Erasmus admitted, the team did not arrive in Japan necessarily expecting a successful outcome in his view three key things – hard work, luck and destiny – propelled them to victory. His squad, he said, did not just want to boost their country’s spirits, they felt an absolute responsibility to do so. To paint their triumph merely as a nice rugby story ignores the inspirational bigger picture surrounding it.This was no ordinary World Cup either. In years to come it might even be seen as the moment rugby union glimpsed a different, more fulfilling future for itself. Up to now – professional era or not – the game has had a tendency to stare more at its own navel than gaze up at the stars. The first World Cup to be staged in Asia – and what a welcoming host Japan proved to be – has altered all that. Far from saying sayonara to their supposed betters and reverting to bit-part status, there is already talk of the Japanese being keen to bid again for a tournament that, according to World Rugby, benefitted the local economy by £3.1bn.Television audiences have also smashed all local records – even beating what one executive has confessed were artificially high old figures – and conservative estimates suggest 10 million people in Japan are now looking to watch more rugby, either live or on television. That instantly puts it among the sport’s biggest markets and ensures the Japanese Rugby Football Union (JRFU) will not be short of new friends or suitors, particularly as the private equity firm CVC will be looking for swift returns from its soon-to-be-announced, multimillion pound investment in international rugby.All this comes at a time when, as well as Japan’s possible admission to the Rugby Championship, other fresh frontiers are being examined. In the buildup to France staging the 2023 World Cup – and its organisers are already visibly excited about the possibilities – World Rugby intends to announce simultaneously the venues for both the next two tournaments. The process is continuing but do not be too surprised if South Africa – outflanked at the last minute of the 2023 vote by France – win hosting rights for 2027 with the US to follow in 2031, by which time England’s Tom Curry will only be a sprightly 33.Already the organisers of next year’s Olympics in Tokyo expect interest in rugby sevens to soar even higher, despite the anticipated high temperatures that will require games to be played in the early morning and late afternoon. They also report sports fans in Japan have particularly loved the family-friendly, fun-loving ethos of rugby crowds, as well as being energised by the dazzling performances by their own team.Not everything in the garden is rosy – the JRFU still has much work to do in terms of giving more youngsters exposure to good rugby at school and youth level – but it was also instructive to hear the world female sevens player of the year, New Zealand’s Ruby Tui, discussing her specialist area of the game. “Whether you like watching women’s rugby or not, sevens is growing at an insane rate,” said Tui, who has herself had to overcome significant adversity to reach the top. There are plenty of excellent female role models out there, as the 2021 women’s World Cup will underline.It is the same with the men. Michael Leitch, Alun Wyn Jones, Kieran Read, Kolisi … if rugby is to be judged by the inspirational leaders shaping the values and attitudes of the next generation, it is in decent shape. There is also cautious optimism on the tackle-height front: while it remains premature to draw firm conclusions, the message regarding high and reckless challenges did appear to sink in after a fractious opening fortnight. Contrary to everyone’s worst fears, the big knockout games were mostly unscarred by red cards: the exception was the France v Wales quarter-final but, frankly, the elbow thrown by Sébastien Vahaamahina would have qualified for an early bath in any era.The potential implications are tantalising: if injury rates can be reduced across the world and smaller players enjoy a renaissance – it was a pity in that regard that the diminutive Cheslin Kolbe did not pip his hulking teammate Pieter-Steph du Toit to the world player of the year award – the game’s custodians could have all their ducks in a row as they continue to enhance player welfare.As things stand, the nine Saracens players involved in Saturday’s final in Yokohama will barely have time to unpack their bags before their club open their European Champions Cup defence against Racing 92 in Paris on Sunday week. It can only be hoped Owen Farrell, Maro Itoje and co are still standing for England’s opening Six Nations fixture to France on 2 February.Then again, maybe they will draw inspiration from their multitasking clubmate Vincent Koch who, remarkably, has now won the Premiership, Champions Cup, the Rugby Championship and the World Cup in the same calendar year. Either way, the British \u0026amp Irish Lions tour to South Africa in 2021 has gone up several notches in intensity and the new coaches of Wales and Ireland, Wayne Pivac and Andy Farrell respectively, face baptisms of fire.Sizeable challenges still confront the whole game but tap into the can-do spirit of the 2019 World Cup and anything is possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c83c1a620f5461b85f5d9d61729395a9bdcde202/0_32_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2d6cf98a52e813d466691509442a5c4","title":"how lewis hamilton won his f1 sixth title in pictures","story":"A look back at some of the best images from the season as Lewis Hamilton became the second most successful driver in Formula One history"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f653678e418344415a033848a828abdb8523e67/0_402_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f85553466d42a67fa140f84eb836b370","title":"phoebe eclair powell shed exploded view bruntwood prize playwriting","story":"Judges praise her experimental, starkly violent play based on a Cornelia Parker installation as ‘astonishingly emotional’Phoebe Eclair-Powell has won the 2019 Bruntwood prize for playwriting with a searing experimental drama based on Cornelia Parker’s Cold Dark Matter. Parker’s installation presented the contents of a shed blown apart by the British army and frozen as if mid-explosion. Eclair-Powell’s starkly violent play, Shed: Exploded View, which borrows the subheader of Parker’s 1991 artwork, is described by the playwright as “an explosion in action”.The play opens with fireworks and a New Year’s Eve marriage proposal. Or rather, that is the first scene presented in the script, but Eclair-Powell states: “This is one order in which the scenes can work. The scenes each have titles, so that, if the director and actors wanted to, they could reorder the scenes to fit their production.” The play s 30 years in the lives of three couples and comprises many short scenes that keep the audience guessing about the connections between characters and how the stories fit together. Eclair-Powell receives £16,000 in prize money and will develop the script with Manchester’s Royal Exchange theatre, where the awards ceremony was held on Monday.Bryony Shanahan, recently appointed joint artistic director at the Royal Exchange and one of the judges for the prize, said the shortlisted plays had “kept us debating for hours”. She described Shed: Exploded View as “precise and considered, a beautiful tapestry of ideas meticulously woven together, but also astonishingly emotional”. The play, she said, “deals with themes of female trauma with dignity, offering hope to her characters and the audience along the way”.Eclair-Powell, the daughter of comedian Jenny Eclair, has written several plays including Fury, an updated take on Medea Torch, which she described as a “celebration of womanhood” and Epic Love and Pop Songs, a piece of gig-theatre about teenage friendship featuring tracks by Patti Smith and Miley Cyrus.Shed: Exploded View is the overall winner of the Bruntwood prize. The judges award went to Glee \u0026amp Me by Stuart Slade the “original new voice” award for debut writers was won by Michael John O’Neill for his play Akedah and the international award went to New York-based writer Kimber Lee for the strikingly named Untitled F*ck Miss Sa*gon Play (Srsly This Is Not the Title), which addresses Asian stereotypes in the US entertainment industry.Minamore said that Shed: Exploded View “plays with form, but not in a way that feels pretentious or gratuitous. Its stage directions claim the scenes could work in any order, so, as soon as I had read it from beginning to end, I read the scenes again, but backwards, and that’s when I had a feeling we’d found the winner. It’s such an ambitious and painful exploration of domestic violence and gender and family, and the precision and subtlety in the language really struck me.“Overall, I was surprised most by how many stories on the shortlist I knew would immediately have an audience if they were staged tomorrow.”Other previous winners of the Bruntwood prize include Katherine Soper and Duncan Macmillan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab42ba95e03e0c3fde3f5678575dd597b3f479ba/0_37_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=088036f087824d6321cf4e5560872408","title":"google workers climate plan letter","story":"Letter signed by more than 1,000 employees calls for zero emissions by 2030 in latest wave of industry climate activismMore than 1,000 Google workers have signed a public letter calling on their employer to commit to an aggressive “company-wide climate plan” that includes canceling contracts with the fossil fuel industry and halting its donations to climate change deniers.The letter, which is addressed to Google’s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, also calls for zero emissions by 2030 and “zero collaboration with entities enabling the incarceration, surveillance, displacement or oppression of refugees or frontline communities”.“We’re excited to keep building momentum as tech workers join millions of people all over the world acting boldly for a livable future,” said Sharon Campbell-Crow, a senior technical writer for Google, by email. “Marginalized communities have worked for climate justice for decades Google needs to catch up and stop funding climate denial.”The public campaign by Google workers follows similar efforts by employees of Amazon and Microsoft. Workers across the tech industry participated in the global climate strike on 20 September.But Google has also made large donations to more than a dozen organizations that have worked against climate action or sought to roll-back environmental protections, the  revealed in October. Those contributions include funds to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which helped convince the Trump administration to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.The letter calls for “zero funding for climate-denying or -delaying think tanks, lobbyists and politicians”.Google chief executive Sundar Pichai responded to the demand for zero emissions by 2030 in an interview with the Financial Times on the day of the global climate strike.“It doesn’t seem unreasonable to me,” he said. “We want to be ambitious in how we think about it. It definitely seems the kind of timeline by which we want to accomplish those things.”“We stand by our call for Google to make a clear public commitment to all four demands,” said Campbell-Crow.The letter also takes aim at the company’s contracts with fossil fuel companies. Google provides cloud computing services for the oil and gas industry, including using its artificial intelligence technology to help fossil fuel companies perform data analysis, according to Gizmodo.“I can’t feel good about my job if the profits I help generate and the codebases I contribute to can be leveraged to accelerate fossil fuel extraction or fund groups that delay or deny urgent climate action,” said Sam Kern, a UX engineer at Google. “It’s unacceptable for Google to build technologies that help oil and gas companies identify new reserves, accelerate extraction, and prolong reliance on fossil fuels.”The letter comes just over a year after approximately 20,000 Google employees staged a walkout in protest of the company’s handling of sexual harassment. The company has been at the center of a wave of employee activism in the tech industry, with employees speaking out over issues ranging from the ethics of supplying artificial intelligence to the US defense department to the treatment of subcontracted workers. has contacted Google for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63c7df4ecb0fb094f812a9124fe8e5972c584e80/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83af77234ed551488a6f850cf0ff0e09","title":"share a tip on cosy places to stay in the uk in winter to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Towns and country can be magical in winter but to fully enjoy the atmosphere a cosy place to stay is essential.

But was it a magical smash – or a clunky mess? Here are your reviews• His Dark Materials review – a riveting realisation of Philip Pullman’s magicI can only recollect the books vaguely as I read them over 15 years ago, but the first episode brought back the feeling of reading them, which is the highest praise I can give. Well done to all involved – I am genuinely excited for the rest. TKStokerI can understand why Philip Pullman is so enthusiastic about this adaptation. This first episode set the scene for me, remarkably similarly to how the book did. To some who don’t know the books, this may seem a slow start but stick with it, it’s about to take off and then it won’t stop. funky_rascalI was incredibly nervous about this when they announced it, and only cautiously optimistic when the trailer aired. The books were honestly life-changing for me growing up, and after the godawful 2007 film I’d concluded the story was basically unfilmable. Looks like I was wrong! I didn’t think the first episode was perfect, but they got much more right than wrong. Dafne Keen, James McAvoy and Ruth Wilson are all superbly cast, and I thought they handled Roger’s story perfectly. nineteeneightythreeClunky expositionary dialogue can be forgiven due to the nature of the extraordinary fictional world being created, but there was some terrible acting – and as for that music … Just for once could a BBC drama allow its viewers to think for themselves? No way was this a five-star adaptation. SaintVespaluusNear perfect. I was particularly impressed with how they showed Lyra’s delivery to Oxford, Asriel’s explorations and other short, informative and well written scenes. They added background and context without too much exposition or going the whole Peter Jackson’s The Hobbit route of hours of extra historical detail. I loved the film version but this was so, so much better. I only hope that the team behind this complete the trilogy, as the greatest disappointment in the film was that the plug was pulled on the project. skausmausIf the rest of this series continues in this fashion, it could easily be the best adaptation of any book ever. PauliesonneI thought it was incredible. My only slight criticism was lots of scenes where you couldn’t see the character’s daemon – they are such an important part of the books and the choice of animal always fitting to personality, and Pullman always made a point of telling you about every character’s daemon when first introducing them. Felt a bit like the BBC were skimping on costs! But otherwise, completely brilliant and I will be so happy if it finally gets the wider audience and appreciation it deserves. OrchidaWhile I admired Pullman’s obvious intellectual clarity and breadth of vision, I did struggle to complete the books. The imaginative scope was undeniably breathtaking, but the prose I found jarringly clunky at times, the storyline sometimes overwrought. Strangely, I feel the same about this BBC production. Scrupulous detailing and high production values notwithstanding, the dialogue and delivery seems stilted and stagey, which makes the narrative experience again a bit uninvolving and less than the sum of its aspirational parts. I’ll continue to watch, but I fear that for me it will be reliving a less than exhilarating experience. styxanstanesI’ve just watched it on the iPlayer and enjoyed it thoroughly. I did try reading one of the trilogy (presumably the first) some years ago but couldn’t really get into it – this treatment, however, is excellent and I’m sure I’ll be there for the whole thing. Of course, it’s meant for children but I suppose I’ll cope, somehow, despite ‘celebrating’ my 80th birthday in January. geoff1940I was 11 when the first book came out and honestly it was life changing. Had always enjoyed reading but this was challenging and immersive – I’d never read anything like it before. It set me on a path to reading so many more interesting and varied texts and even inspired me to study English at university. I even became known at the local book shop for hounding them for the release date of the second and third books, which ended up landing me a Saturday job there when I was 15. You get the picture ... I thought tonight’s programme was just amazing and 11-year-old me was very, very happy to be transported back to Lyra’s world.

Whether it’s the clothes you wear or the way you cook, the coffee beans you grind or the bed linen you choose for your home, it’s all carefully thought out and assembled. But you don’t have to be from Paris to buy into the fantasy – just pay a visit to one of these uniquely Parisian stores next time you’re in town …For curated fashionSet up a few years ago by young designer Morgane Sézalory, who wanted to do things differently and start as an online-only fashion label with no shops, Sézane has since grown, with 1.3m followers on Instagram, but still operates in the same innovative way. There is now a lovely appartement in the heart of Paris where you can try on clothes, shoes, accessories and jewels, and a conciergerie where you can order them online. Committed to sustainable fashion, the label’s materials are all sourced, and everything is mostly made, in Europe. Delivery is ace and extra reliable. The style is effortlessly chic.An alternative to Sézane is the equally sustainable and organic fashion label, Ekyog.For bags of styleDominique Picquier is a Parisian woman with fizzing ideas and natural chic. An artist, she started drawing designs for fabric and wallpapers for others before setting up her own fabric label and shop and acquiring a small leather factory in the south of France, so she could control all the different stages of the production. The result is great quality and products that last. Her bags have thus become a must-have. My favourite is the pochette style in the mimosa pattern (from €59).For sustainable coolEco-friendly chic finds an ideal home in Paris, where some French habits have been championing sustainability for decades. Take, for instance, the Parisian love for secondhand vintage: Paris has been a leader since it created flea markets in the 1890s. And this includes furniture, jewels, paintings, ceramics and more. For a time-travelling experience, and the opportunity to pick up vintage beauties at smart prices, head towards the north of Paris, to Saint-Ouen. My favourite part is Marché Biron, but you can also pick up great one-off pieces from the other existing 15 markets. Last time there, we spotted Pete Doherty, Vanessa Paradis and Léa Seydoux.Marché Biron, 85 Rue des Rosiers, 93400 Saint-Ouen. Saturday to Monday only. marcheauxpuces-saintouenFor haute homewareA recent trend in Paris has been the conversion of former warehouses or factories into galleries and shops. Merci, standing halfway between République and Bastille, is a grand magasin whose range of products, from knitted clothes to kitchenware, bed linens and stationery, have been carefully curated by Merci’s army of scouts travelling the world for the best of independent designers. Their cafe, sheltered in their secondhand bookshop, offers a nice place for a quick rest.Paris museums’ shops can sometimes offer the ultimate stylish experience with products as carefully curated as the exhibitions. One of my favourites is the Musées des Arts Décoratifs’ boutique, near the Louvre, where you will find the latest French design in glassware, ceramics, jewels and stationery.For keen foodiesLast time you walked around Les Halles, right in the heart of Paris, you may have wondered why there were so many kitchen utensil shops. Les Halles was, as writer Émile Zola called it in the 1870s, “the belly of Paris”: a 24-hour-a-day market where all the food products of France converged to be sold to chefs and restaurants. This marvel of 1860s architecture by Victor Baltard – which has provided the setting for scenes in many novels, such as James Baldwin’s Giovanni’s Room – was demolished in 1971, but many restaurants have remained, some still open day and night, as well as those famous kitchen shops. Two, almost facing each other, at the beginning of Rue Montmartre, are worth a detour. Mora was founded in 1814, and La Bovida in 1921. Feel like a pro and step inside the two temples of cooking to discover devices you never thought existed.For coffee connoisseursYou don’t think chic applies to coffee? Head straight to Café Vernet, founded in 1880, and you’ll change your mind. The small café, recently restored to its belle époque cosiness, is a hidden gem and a shelter after an exhausting day of shopping. You’ll be able to sip your coffee from a selection of around 50 different varieties and house blends and, more importantly, you may buy it in whole beans or pre-ground. Try the Grand Pavois, created in 1921 by Auguste Vernet: not too strong, it has rose notes (8€ for 250g). Vernet is also well-known for its homemade fruits confits, candied fruits, which usually get passersby to stop in their tracks.Ready to hit the shops?

Another underappreciated panorama, this time facing Sacré-Cœur, can be found 20 minutes’ walk away, from the Temple de la Sybille folly perched 50 metres above the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont’s artificial lake. Jean Nouvel’s epic Philharmonie de Paris offers both an exemplary concert programme and photo-worthy rooftop views. More adventurous types will take to the left bank’s Parc André Citroën, where you can float 150 metres up beneath a helium-filled balloon.Get up close with Paris’s avant gardeSurrealists may have dominated Montparnasse in the 1920s – Marcel Duchamp, Salvador Dalí and Man Ray were regulars at its salons and cafes – but Russian émigré Ossip Zadkine still hadn’t let cubism go. His tranquil studio and garden on the Rue d’Assas brim with angular, African-inspired sculptures in red wood, plaster, stone and clay. The Musée Zadkine is one of several well-preserved former artists’ studios and homes that hark back to yesteryear Paris. Just around the corner, the Musée Bourdelle is both homely atelier and sprawling art museum, while the Fondation Giacometti houses a reconstruction of his storied studio and an exhibition of some of his greatest works, including the Grande tête mince. Up in Pigalle, the cavernous top levels of the Musée National Gustave Moreau shouldn’t be missed, and the same goes for the Musée de la Vie Romantique, a quaint villa built by Dutch painter Ary Scheffer that’s now a museum dedicated to the Romantic era.Reclaim the city’s abandoned railwaysAbandoned to nature since 1934 and encircling pretty much the whole city, La Petite Ceinture railway network will probably never run again (though, some think it should). These days, the public parts of the 12-mile route – in the 12th, 13th, 15th, 16th and 20th arrondissements – make for an unexpectedly lush urban ramble. One former station in the north has been converted into urban farm and eco-friendly restaurant La Recyclerie, and another’s become Le Hasard Ludique, a multipurpose arts space that hosts everything from tango lessons to drag nights. Train stations, it seems, are Paris’s new cool: two recent openings – experimental music venue La Station Gare des Mines and jazz club La Gare – put on the city’s edgiest nights out.Duck into an old-world arcadeShould it sheet down – which, frankly, isn’t all that unlikely – the city’s hidden network of passages couverts make for the ideal atmospheric escape. You could spend days browsing these “covered passages”, with their quaint boutiques and tasteful teahouses. Snaking through the Grands Boulevards area and down towards the Louvre, the Passage des Panoramas is best for lunch, Passage Verdeau for antiques (and waxworks at the Musée Grévin), and Galerie Vivienne for high-end fashion. Don’t miss Galerie Vivienne’s gorgeous glass roof and beautiful mosaicked floors. And when you’re done, head to the Rue des Lombards for live jazz at one of the strip’s handful of legendary clubs, such as the Baiser Salé, the Duc des Lombards or SunsetSunside.Take the plunge at a scenic swimming spotYou might not be able to swim in the Seine, but you can swim on it. Moored next to the imposing Bibliothèque François Mitterrand in the south-east, the Piscine Joséphine Baker is a floating pool complete with saunas, hammams, a jacuzzi, and to-die-for Seine views, preserved in winter by a sliding glass roof. Built in the 1920s, the Butte-aux-Cailles swimming pool is another option for those looking to go for a dip in the great outdoors (there’s an indoor pool and two outdoor pools). And don’t worry about getting chilly the water is a balmy 28C.Pay tribute to the city’s illustrious deadIf you haven’t already been on a teenage pilgrimage to pay Jim Morrison and Oscar Wilde your respects, then it’s well worth spending a day trying to locate them in the 44-hectare Cimetière du Père Lachaise. Molière, Honoré de Balzac, Marcel Proust, Colette, Édith Piaf: it’s easy to stumble upon recognisable names here. Take a map, or don’t – this place lends itself to an aimless gander. Less likely to throng with tour groups are the low-key Cimetière de Montmartre (Alexandre Dumas, Edgar Degas, François Truffaut) and Cimetière de Montparnasse (Charles Baudelaire, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir). Serge Gainsbourg is buried in the latter, but his former home by the Seine is where his fans gather en masse. For some light relief, the Deyrolle is an eccentric taxidermy museum and shop where you’ll find curiosities of a very different sort, while the Musée des Arts Forains feels like a gaudy graveyard of disused funfair rides.Discover Paris with easyJet flights from 10 different UK airports.

The co-conspirators turned out to be undercover agents.Court documents say Richard Holzer was arrested Friday in the city of Pueblo just after the agents brought him what were supposedly two pipe bombs along with dynamite to blow up Temple Emanuel.The agents said Holzer described the explosives as “absolutely gorgeous” and said they should go ahead with the attack overnight to avoid police.The investigation into Holzer began after an undercover FBI agent purporting to be a woman who supports white supremacy contacted him on Facebook.Holzer repeatedly espoused antisemitic and white supremacist views in his messages with the agent. “I wish the Holocaust really did happen ... they need to die,” he wrote her on Facebook, according to the court documents.Holzer told the agent he had checked out the temple property and met with her and other undercover agents at a Pueblo motel on Friday. He brought a copy of Adolf Hitler’s Mein Kampf with him, the documents said.The agents then arrested Holzer, who waived his right to remain silent and spoke to investigators, the documents said.“He referred to the plan as ‘my mountain’ and to Jews and Synagogues as a ‘cancer’ to the community,” the document said.Holzer is due to make his first court appearance Monday.It’s not clear if he has a lawyer representing him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23359c04f83f5e41d7b6f3dae5ed70f81b3d15c5/0_195_5841_3505/master/5841.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed3ca7da736b21b4f053a73fbaf4171b","title":"canadians high lead levels drinking water investigation","story":"Hundreds of thousands of Canadians have been unwittingly exposed to high levels of lead in their drinking water, according to an investigation that tested drinking water in hundreds of homes and reviewed thousands more previously undisclosed results.Residents in some homes in Montreal and Regina, in the western prairies, are among those drinking and cooking with tap water with lead levels that exceed Canada’s federal guidelines. The investigation found some schools and daycare centers had lead levels so high that researchers noted it could harm children’s health. Leona Peterson learned of the contamination in her water after journalists found excessively high lead levels in 21 of 25 homes tested in her small, north-west port town of Prince Rupert. Peterson, who lives in subsidized housing for Indigenous people, had water that registered at 15.6 ppb.“I was drinking from the tap, directly from the tap, without any knowledge that there was lead in the water,” said Peterson. The town of Prince Rupert is among more than a dozen communities along Canada’s wild west coast where residents – many of them Indigenous – are living in homes with ageing pipes, drinking corrosive rainwater that is likely to draw lead. Some localities are taking action. Montreal’s mayor, Valérie Plante, vowed to test 100,000 homes for lead and speed up replacement of lead-lined pipes immediately after journalists sent her an analysis of the city’s internal data revealing high lead levels across the city.The media consortium filed more than 700 Freedom of Information requests and took hundreds of samples in homes to collect more than 79,000 water test results. But the findings are neither comprehensive nor an indication of overall drinking water quality in Canada. “Because there is no federal oversight, everybody does what they want,” said engineering professor Michèle Prévost, who quit working on a government study of school drinking water in frustration over the lack of lead testing. “Most provinces ignore this very serious problem.”The government’s approach to limiting lead in drinking water in Canada is starkly different from the US, where the Environmental Protection Agency sets legal standards, and every person is supposed to receive an annual Consumer Confidence Report from their water provider.There is no similar, routine testing or notice in Canada, with the exception of Ontario, which posts results online.In the US, even public water quality reports were not enough to prevent the Flint, Michigan drinking water crisis, brought on by a 2014 decision to temporarily pull water from a river as a cost saver while installing new pipelines. The Flint crisis sparked congressional hearings, lawsuits and scrutiny of lead testing across the country. In Canada, where lawsuits are less frequent and provinces – not the federal government – set water safety rules, the main source of lead in drinking water is antiquated pipes. At one government hearing, an expert estimated some 500,000 lead service lines are still delivering water to people in the country.Some cities, like Montreal, are already working to replace them. But homeowners are almost always responsible for paying the cost of replacing the section of pipe from their property lines to their homes.Canada is one of the only developed countries that does not have a nationwide drinking water standard. Even countries that struggle to provide safe drinking water have established acceptable lead levels: India’s is 10 ppb, Mexico and Egypt’s are 5 ppb, according to those country’s government websites."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a96877458e2a4397add3887536ef80179e86b7ad/0_308_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8226345ef8d6912827f44515abed32cf","title":"delhi residents engulfed in pollution blame authorities for inaction","story":"Public health emergency declared after air pollution levels go off the charts It was meant to be a ceremony to bring good health and prosperity. But the thousands of women who gathered in the waters of Delhi’s Yamuna River on the city’s most polluted day in three years, to mark the ancient Hindu festival of Chhath Puja, instead had to immerse themselves in the thick toxic waste, while inhaling air so thick with smog that it went off the pollution charts.Sunita Devi, 42, was among those who offered prayers as she stood in the toxic foam of the Yamuna, so thick and frothy from industrial and domestic pollution it made the water resemble a putrid bubble bath. The irony that this was a ritual meant to give thanks to the sun god for sustaining life on earth was not lost on her.“I stood for an hour in the water to offer prayers but it was very oily, dirty and had a bad smell,” said Devi. “According to the ritual we are supposed to bathe in the water but I could not bring myself to do it fully, though my friends took a full dip even with the smell. My legs were itching after a while and I had to go home and take a bath.”Living in the world’s most polluted city has taken a toll on almost every one of its 20 million citizens, especially since the Hindu festival of Diwali, which prompted a severe deterioration in air quality. As the air pollution levels reached catastrophic levels – almost 10 times above the healthy limit on the weekend – a public health emergency was declared and has remained in place for the past five days. The streets have emptied, schools remained closed and many did not go into work on Monday morning as the air quality index remained stubbornly in the category of “severe”.Monday also saw the temporary introduction of a scheme, which ran previously in 2016, where cars with odd and even number plates can only drive on alternate days, which authorities say will take 1.2m cars off Delhi’s roads each day. However, most in the city were highly sceptical about the plan, which will only be in place for two weeks.“They did this scheme twice before and it is pointless,” said Amit, a driver. “I am not supposed to be taking my car out today but I am just taking the back roads and short cuts to avoid the traffic officers. All the other drivers I know are doing the same. Yes pollution is a terrible problem, I have had an awful chest infection for the past two days because of it, but this temporary scheme is not going to change anything. We need real action from the government.”The sentiment was exemplified by politician Vijay Goel, senior leader of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), who chose to defy the rules and took his car with an odd number plate out for a drive.In a city such as Delhi, where poverty and homelessness is rife and millions make their living on the sides of the roads, not all had the option of taking shelter in homes or driving cars equipped with air purifiers.At his stall selling chickpeas on the roadside of Kamla Nagar, north Delhi, Dinesh Raj said both his health and his business was suffering. “I generally earn around 400 to 500 rupees per day but after the bad pollution I have only sold three plates and it’s already lunchtime,” Raj said, rubbing his eyes which he complained were burning.“People are not coming out of their houses anymore, only those like me who cannot afford to stay indoors are here. And even though I cover it up, people are afraid to eat my food because they think the bad air is affecting it. If the government doesn’t do something to clean up the air, I am going to have to go back to my village in Bihar.”The lacklustre and uncoordinated response to the crisis from both the federal government and state governments of Delhi, and neighbouring Punjab and Haryana where the burning of the crop stubble has been a key contributor to Delhi’s thick toxic smog, has been a source of infuriation and anger for the city’s residents.Navdha Malhotra, campaigns director for Purpose, a social impact agency who run a mobilisation campaign called Help Delhi Breathe, spoke of her anger that the state governments were “all passing the buck and blaming each other while we have to live in this disgusting layer of smog.”“As a citizen of Delhi who has lived here all my life, this is absolutely disgraceful,” she said. “The Delhi government is very progressive in terms of policies on paper but there is zero implementation and no political will on this issue. People are angry and mobilising, particularly parents who now feel like they can’t let their children go outside, but overall civic action here is also pretty disgraceful. I have seen citizens in Delhi bursting firecrackers while wearing masks.”As Delhi residents woke on the weekend to smog so brown and thick that it was impossible to see more than a few feet ahead, India’s health minister Harsh Vardhan tweeted that a good solution to offsetting its harmful impact was to eat carrots. Sunil Bharala, minister for the state of Utter Pradesh, meanwhile, defended the practice of crop burning by farmers, declaring it a “natural system”.While Delhi’s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has been publicly candid about the problem, calling the current pollution crisis unbearable, he has also been criticised for passing the blame for the problem on to adjacent states.While firecrackers were banned and construction has been halted in Delhi since the state of emergency was declared on Friday, in reality these rules have barely been enforced. On Monday, the supreme court judges slammed all responsible authorities for failing to tackle pollution in the capital, saying that people had been “left to die”.“No one is safe even inside homes. It is atrocious,” the judges added.Malhotra condemned the Board for Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) for allowing a match against Bangladesh to go ahead in Delhi when the pollution levels were off the charts. “We should not be normalising these conditions by doing things like hosting a cricket match,” she said. “It is deathly, and when pollution gets that bad, the whole city should be shutting down. Only then will politicians take this seriously.”An indication of both the increasing obvious severity of the pollution, but also increased public awareness about its harmful impact on health, has been masks, which are now visible on the faces of people all over the streets of Delhi. In a mark of the growing public anger in some quarters, a citizens protest is also planned at Indian Gate on Tuesday evening to decry the lack of action by authorities.But for many there has been no hiding from the thick poisonous smog. Kushal Malik, a Delhi traffic police officer, had spent the past 12 hours on duty on one of city’s busiest and most polluted roads, with no choice but to inhale the fumes. “I have constant throat irritation, headache and a burning sensation in my eyes,” he said. “The government has provided us with masks but they are not effective for pollution levels this bad. It is not good enough.”Additional reporting by Kakoli Bhattacharya"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26e3963915061dd351186268fb8e31136aa36929/0_96_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b32ae3ee2d2263b7f001ffadfee01682","title":"irans production of enriched uranium rises tenfold in two months","story":"Experts warn of dangerous consequences as nuclear deal continues to unravelIran has announced a tenfold increase in enriched uranium production as Tehran backs away from its nuclear deal with the west.Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran’s atomic energy organisation, said enriched uranium production was now at 5kg per day, up from 450g two months ago. The announcement coincided with the 40th anniversary of the Iranian takeover of the US embassy.The nuclear deal has been unravelling since May 2018 when Donald Trump withdrew the US and reimposed sanctions on Iran. Tehran said earlier this year it would gradually shed its commitments under the deal and is due to announce its next step within days unless the US lifts economic sanctions.The production increases were made possible by the introduction of two new advanced centrifuges, one of which is undergoing testing. Salehi said Iran was now operating 60 IR-6 advanced centrifuges, a violation of the deal.Salehi added that Iranian engineers were also working on a prototype called IR-9 and said that this would be 50 times faster than the first-generation IR-1s allowed under the accord.Iran said it had now removed all its IR-1 centrifuges and is only using advanced models, leading to the sharp increase in production. It has been calculated that the new centrifuges mean it would take Iran a year to develop a nuclear bomb, something it insists it has no intention of doing.The deal was brokered in 2015 and included Iran agreeing to limit its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of economic sanctions, in particular on oil exports.It is not clear how the European Union will react to the latest step, but so far the EU has not put the whole nuclear agreement into review, which would be the first move towards its suspension and possible collapse.The EU sent an early warning shot on Monday, saying its support for the nuclear deal depended on Tehran fulfilling its commitments. The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said the announcement was unacceptable and was putting the whole nuclear deal at risk.Tehran says it is no longer prepared to wait for Europe to fulfil its commitment to boost trade with Iran, made at the time of the deal in 2015.Europe has made promises to find ways to circumvent the US sanctions, but little that is substantial or legally watertight has emerged from extensive talks between Tehran and the three main European powers, Britain, France and Germany. Senior Iranians have blamed a general European strategic weakness in part caused by the distraction of Brexit.In a sign that Tehran has decided it is not worth negotiating with Trump, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called French president Emmanuel Macron’s efforts to set up talks between Iran and the US to break the impasse “naive”.Macron’s efforts to initiate a phone call between Trump and his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in September ended in failure and Rouhani has stressed he would only hold talks with the US if sanctions were lifted first."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3eef9f605d166cba0c144accfcc4b513704ebcb/0_130_5015_3010/master/5015.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1596d9e29c6faea729c609f3fcfc955e","title":"bulging at the seams auckland a super city struggling with its own success","story":"The government dreamed of a metropolis that is a beacon to all but the pace of change has left some behind and others disillusionedby  Mark Broatch in Auckland and  Eleanor Ainge RoyTāmaki Makaurau, the Māori name for Auckland which can be translated as “the place desired by many”, is living up to its billing. The city’s population has swelled rapidly to 1.7 million and is estimated to be adding 40,000 people a year. By 2048 it could host nearly half of New Zealand’s current population.In the 1980s only a couple of thousand people lived in the central city. Now some 57,000 people call it home, a figure that was not expected to be reached until 2032.Auckland is grappling to cope with that population growth. Traffic jams on clogged motorways can stretch into hours. Decades of under-funding of public transport has led to a patchwork and complicated system serving a total area of around about 1000 sq kms . The rising cost of living has spawned a growing homeless population, with some forced to live in parks or sleep in their cars, and garages are now rented out as accommodation for hundreds of dollars a week.Paul Spoonley, a sociology professor at Massey University, says the harbour city is simply bulging at the seams. “Infrastructure and service provision simply has not kept up with the rate of population growth, but also because there’s been a historic deficit,” he says. “We haven’t had enough houses in Auckland for decades, and there hasn’t been a major investment in adequate public transport for a very long time.”Jenna Todd, 34, and her husband, Stu, rent a home in Auckland’s Mount Roskill but are actively looking to buy. Todd lists Auckland’s “food, ersity, weather, and easy access to rural getaways” as the major reasons she loves the city.Todd manages the popular Time Out bookstore in the inner-city suburb of Mount Eden, and has noted rising tension between suburban business areas such as hers “adapting to population growth – with higher density housing, developing alternative transport to cars – and the desire to preserve heritage, views and green spaces”.“Auckland is spread out, which isolates our population into pockets,” says Todd, who broadly welcomes further growth of Auckland’s population, if better planning and infrastructure provisions are made. “We need to continue to connect suburbs with efficient public transport and safe cycleways, to encourage accessible movement throughout the city.“I want people to travel to the Mount Eden village without worrying about clogged roads and parking to spend money at our locally owned businesses. I think Auckland won’t be able to compare with large, international cities until this happens.”Auckland is regularly ranked as one of the best cities in the world to live in, but also one of the most expensive. Spoonley says the average cost of housing is nine times the average household income.Until the 1950s, Auckland had a transport system that was the envy of the world. Its quarter of a million citizens took more than 100m trips a year, on ferries and buses but mainly on frequent, cheap, council-run trams to all points of the compass.“Everyone took an average of nearly two trips per day,” says Ben van Bruggen, the Londoner now in charge of Auckland council’s urban design strategy. “That’s the kind of level that London Underground operates at.”But the city tore up the tram lines and laid down motorways. It is only now, thanks to costly investment in public transport, that many are leaving their cars at home again. “To get back to 100m public transport trips last year, that’s quite a turnaround,” Van Bruggen says. “That’s doubled within 10 years.” It doubled from a low base. The population is now nearly seven times that of the 50s, and per-capita patronage levels don’t approach those of Sydney or Melbourne, for example, let alone what they might have been if the trams had been retained. And it has come at a considerable cost.Billions have been spent electrifying a suburban rail system, adding bus routes and a separate busway along the northern motorway, and shifting the terminus into the city centre. A further NZ$4bn (£2bn) of taxpayer and ratepayer money is being spent on converting the terminus into a loop that will double the network’s capacity by 2024. A few ided cycleways have gone in, and a long-delayed one across the harbour bridge and on to the northern suburbs is slated for next year.But more is needed. Traffic congestion is a perennial complaint for commuters and costs hundreds of millions a year in productivity. “There is no more car capacity,” Van Bruggen says. Commitments have been made to new light rail lines in the next decade.Commuters complain about the cost of short bus trips and that the rail network doesn’t go to enough suburbs, but South Auckland’s Phyllis Jaggard and Noelene Bowden are fans of the frequent and quiet electric trains over their “terrible, smelly diesel” predecessors. Jaggard hardly drives into the city because of better services and reduced parking. “It’s annoying when services get cancelled,” she says. “But every city in the world has this problem.”Despite the challenges, Auckland is “maturing and moving quite quickly”, taking lessons from other global cities and its own earlier failures, Van Bruggen says. “It’s getting out of its teenager angst.”Old chemical storages facilities are being turned into a medium-rise residential-commercial area called Wynyard Quarter. The city’s waterfront, which used to be fenced off to store imported used cars, is being opened up.Some NZ$14bn of public and private development is going on in the city centre alone. Auckland council forecasts that the city could have 2.4 million people by 2048 and need a further 313,000 dwellings and up to 263,000 extra jobs.A government-commissioned working group recommended in October moving the city’s port north, potentially freeing up 77 hectares of prime seafront land. The city has also earmarked 15,000 hectares for future urban development, largely in the north and south.The city is also working with developers to provide affordable homes. A survey found Auckland contained 40,000 “ghost houses”, properties empty for much of the year.Of course, many challenges still exist. Over half the country’s overcrowding is in Auckland and more than 20,000 people are estimated to suffer “severe housing deprivation”. Māori and Pacific peoples are overrepresented in homelessness figures. The population squeeze and traffic congestion are part of the reason more than 30,000 Aucklanders left for other parts of the country in the four years to 2017, many of them older Pākehā (New Zealanders of European descent), according to a demographer, Natalie Jackson.Yet Auckland’s second-term mayor, Phil Goff, whose English immigrant grandfather drove a tram for 20 years, is upbeat. He told the : “You’re seeing a city that’s transforming, both in scale and how people want to live and how they want to get around it.”additional reporting by Harriet Sherwood"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4072250.1572900676!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"boil water notice reissued for greater dublin area","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere was a run on bottled water in shops and supermarkets after a boil water notice last month. Photograph: Alan BetsonA boil water notice has been reimposed for some 600,000 people in the greater Dublin area, less than a fortnight after the last one was lifted.Those in the areas affected by the boil water notice can use only boiled or bottled water for drinking and in food preparation.Late last month, a boil water warning notice was put in place after a mechanical issue at the Leixlip treatment plant caused concerns about the quality of supply.Irish Water and Fingal County Council blamed the latest precaution on heavy rain and “turbidity”, or cloudy water due to suspended particles, in the source water for the Leixlip plant, which exceeded acceptable levels.“Plant operators reacted quickly before alarms were activated and shut down the old plant to stop this water entering the network. There were no issues at the new plant, where the level of turbidity was managed by the newer technology on site,” they said in a statement.“It was essential to re-start production at the old plant, which produces 20 per cent of drinking water for Dublin, otherwise significant restrictions and outages would be inevitable. As Irish Water cannot guarantee the quality the water from the old plant, a boil water notice is now in place.”Social Democrats co-leader Roisín Shortall described the latest malfunction as shocking. “Irish Water must be made accountable for this scandalous failure in the provision of the most basic public service.”The initial problem was as a result of the disinfectant process for the water at the Leixlip plant being compromised.There was a run on bottled water in shops and supermarkets with many places selling out.‘Extremely concerned’The Leixlip plant supplies water to homes, schools and businesses across most of north Dublin city and the Fingal administrative area of north county Dublin, parts of south-west Dublin and parts of counties Meath and Kildare.Eamon Gallen, Irish Water’s general manager, apologised on Monday for the inconvenience caused to homes and businesses.“We are very disappointed that a boil water notice has to be imposed again but as we outlined the last time, our number one priority is the public health and the safety and well-being of our customers,” he said.“The choice we were faced with was customers having a severely restricted water supply for a long period of time or having water for sanitation purposes such as showering and flushing of toilets. We were left with no option but to resume production at the old plant in the knowledge that a boil water notice would then be necessary.”As with the last boil water notice, about 600,000 people are impacted. The areas impacted are the same as previously parts of Fingal, areas in Dublin City Council, parts of South Dublin County Council, parts of Kildare and Dunboyne in Meath.Irish Water is due before the Oireachtas housing committee on Tuesday, where it is expected to say it is not possible to run plants like the Leixlip one “under the current working arrangements”.Managing director Niall Gleeson will tell the committee a “plant of this size cannot be reliant on the sole response of iniduals,” and argue that all available technology must be used to prevent such a failure occurring again.Noel Rock, the chair of the committee, said it was “very frustrating” to see a second boil water notice introduced. “600,000 people are back on boil water notices. They deserve clear answers as to why this is happening,” he said.An audit of the Leixlip water plant and the events leading up to the first boil water notice found the level of treatment is not sufficient to manage the risk posed by the River Liffey source water.It criticised Irish Water and Fingal County Council for failing to implement the recommendations of an audit in March, and found also that several alarms had been triggered in the run up to the October boil water notice before action was taken.

It is simply not good enough. Clean drinking water is a most basic need.”Fianna Fáil councillor Mary Fitzpatrick said it was “totally unacceptable that people cannot have confidence the water coming out of their taps is safe”.Independent councillor Mannix Flynn said the second boil notice indicated a “complete failure” of Irish Water. “Who would want to come to this country with scummy, dirty, filthy water?”Lord Mayor Paul McAuliffe agreed to a proposal from several councillors that he would seek a report from Irish Water on the issue.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Irish Water says heavy rainfall has caused contamination at Leixlip treatment plantJudge says defendant, who had rape conviction over incident quashed, lied persistentlyFamily of girl (9) applied for package in May of last year but say decision yet to be madeWorker in Dominick Inn defended himself with pole when Anthony Conway enteredUtility facing cost overruns and inefficiencies in repair work, State oversight body findsJudge notes \u0026lsquodeviousness\u0026rsquo of crime which saw \u0026euro25,000 stolen from bank over eight weeksLawyers for Anne Rossi argued that seized products not handled in line with legislationPaul Wells Jnr (33) alleged to have disposed of chainsaw seen to have \u0026lsquopieces of flesh\u0026rsquo on itPotatoes, carrots, parsnips, winter wheat and barley all under threat from heavy rainJury returns verdict of unlawful killing at inquest into death of Filipina student (24)RT\u0026Eacute staff, politicians, and fellow broadcasters express sadness at deathKerry TD says he voted in the D\u0026aacuteil on June 21st, 2018, and after attended a funeralJoanne Doherty says she \u0026lsquokept re-living\u0026rsquo the death of Garda Robbie McCallion in her headFirst episode of The Late Late Show aired on the 5th of July, 1962 with Byrne as its host"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4071878.1572878145!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"catastrophic storm surge in dublin inevitable over coming decades","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Great South Wall walkway in Dublin Bay with Poolbeg chimneys in the far distanceA catastrophic storm during high tide which will leave thousands of homes, businesses and landmark buildings in Dublin under water is inevitable over the coming decades, one of the country’s foremost climate change experts has warned. Prof Peter Thorne said Ireland had been lucky to “dodge a bullet” until now during major storm events – because they have struck during low or neap tides – but it was only a matter of time until the elements combined for a devastating surge. The Maynooth University academic, who was lead author on the fifth assessment report of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and is aged 40, said he expected a major high tide flood event in his lifetime.In the capital this would mean water from Dublin Bay surging into the Liffey while it was in full flow from the Wicklow mountains. “The combination of water trying to escape and water being pushed up into the river means it will end up moving sideways,” he said. Mr Thorne said the Liffey would “over-top into the surrounding areas” resulting in major flooding in the city centre, while areas like Clontarf and south Dublin would also be badly hit. “There would be hundreds or thousands of properties basically – residential, commercial and government properties – that would be under water for a considerable length of time, with all the implications that that has.” The cost of the clean-up, he predicted, would run into billions of euro. Some of Dublin’s most iconic landmark buildings along the quays from Dublin Port to the Guinness brewery, including Custom House and the Four Courts, would be submerged, he told The . Very lucky“In our lifetime the sea level rises are not going to accelerate much more than it is now – it will be going up a centimetre a year at most globally,” he said. “But then you have the storm surges – and we have been lucky, frankly. We’ve been very lucky over recent decades that when those storm surges have hit they have been at low tide or neap tide. “It is only a matter of time before one hits at high tide, or even worse, spring high tide. Then it will be very, very catastrophic.”Predicting the timing is like “rolling the dice”. “It could be decades, it could happen next week or it could not happen within our lifetime,” he said. “I would expect to see a major event in my lifetime. Somewhere in Ireland I would expect a major sea level combining with storm surge having a large-scale impact,” he said.“It would take months to dry out the structure of properties flooded. Some may be so damaged they would end having to be destroyed and rebuilt. But mostly it would be matter for residents relocating for six to 12 months.”He cautioned against people buying property less than 10 metres above current sea levels in the capital as well as other major urban centres built on the coast, including Cork, Galway and Waterford. “If you are thinking of buying a property clearly don’t buy one near the sea level. If you have a property already that might be at risk, thinking of how to – at low cost – mitigate that risk . . . you can’t at this point, you are kind of in the lap of the gods.” Low-lying areasMr Thorne said he “wouldn’t go anywhere near” many of the expensive coastal homes in low-lying areas of Dublin. “If I was buying property today that I wanted to eventually leave to my children I would not be buying property probably within five to 10 metres of the sea level.” Residents in Clontarf who successfully argued for the lowering of a recently built flood defence sea wall, at a cost of half a million euro to Dublin City Council, to restore their view were of a “King Canute mindset”, said Mr Thorne, who is also director of the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units group. “For some reason these residents feel they can hold back the waters,” he said. “At a national level we need to think about what areas we want to protect and to what level we want to protect them. “Clontarf is a case in point where the government quite rightly wanted to protect the citizens, and the citizens unfortunately decided their view was more valuable than protecting their properties.” Mr Thorne added: “I don’t think people see the risk very well. We are very poor as human beings at recognising and coping with risk. This is one example of that.” Finite pot of moneyResponding to the Government’s briefing last week updating the progress of its climate action plan, he said it faced “hard and difficult choices as to which properties and areas it decides to protect and which it doesn’t”. “There is only a finite pot of money, and there is only a finite amount of properties that can be protected.” The Government will have to decide this on a basis of where is strategically, economically and politically important to protect “and where to let go because you can’t protect everything, you can’t do everything”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4072309.1572894954!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gay byrne in his own words","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGay Byrne: ‘I think about death like everybody else thinks about, anybody who thinks that they’re going to be remembered.’ Photograph: RTÉAt the end of a Late Late Show interview with Annie Murphy, who talked about her relationship with Bishop Eamonn Casey, and their son Peter “I hope his son will be half the man his father was.” After the controversy that followed the comment “Yes, well that was unfortunate and may have been misinterpreted.

Ms McDonald said there was no contradiction in asking republicans to vote for a unionist. Photograph: David YoungPA Wire.Sinn Féin is to stand aside in three Northern constituencies in December’s general election and has urged its voters to back other candidates who support staying in the EU in order to help defeat the pro-Brexit DUP. The party will not run candidates in East Belfast, South Belfast or North Down, with Sinn Féin suggesting voters instead support Alliance party leader Naomi Long, Claire Hanna of the SDLP, and independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon. “The reality is we are asking people to come out and vote for those pro-remain candidates. We believe that is the right and progressive thing to do,” Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said. Speaking to reporters in Belfast on Monday, she said the “stakes are very high” in the December 12th election. “People have a fundamental choice to make - to vote for a positive, inclusive future or to turn their backs on that and to back candidates who have been the architects of Brexit and who have acted very, very deliberately against the democratic wishes of people here in the north and more fundamentally against the economic and social interests of citizens who live here,” she said. In North Down, Lady Sylvia defeated the DUP candidate Alex Easton with a narrow majority of about 1,200 in 2017. ContradictionMs McDonald said there was no contradiction in asking republicans to vote for a unionist. “It sits very comfortably with me to ask and invite voters to thoughtfully do the right thing,” she said.“And in this case it means defying hard Brexiteers, the likes of Nigel Dodds, the likes of the DUP candidates who have very, very recklessly acted against the interests of everybody.“Whether you call yourself a unionist or a nationalist, a republican or a loyalist, we actually have many, many interests in common.”The DUP’s Emma Little-Pengelly is defending a majority of 2,000 in South Belfast, with Mr Hanna considered a strong contender to take the seat. Her party, the SDLP, has also announced that it will not stand in East Belfast, North Belfast or North Down. “Our first priority is to elect pro-remain MPs to vote against Brexit and Boris Johnson but removing pro-Brexit MPs in Belfast is also critical,” the party said. The SDLP’s withdrawal from North Belfast strengthens the position of the Sinn Féin candidate John Finucane, the Lord Mayor of Belfast, who came within 2,000 votes of the DUP’s Nigel Dodds at the last election in 2017. StrengthenThe absence of SDLP and Sinn Féin candidates in East Belfast is intended to strengthen the position of Ms Long against the sitting MP, Gavin Robinson of the DUP. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) said on Sunday that it will not run a candidate in North Belfast. The party’s incoming leader, Steve Aiken, had previously said the UUP would field candidates in all 18 of the North’s constituencies. In a statement, Mr Aiken said the UUP “a party that believes first and foremost in the Union” and he could not “gift” the seat to Sinn Féin. A police investigation is underway after threats were made to the UUP, allegedly by loyalist paramilitaries, over its initial refusal to form an electoral pact. The DUP has said it will continue not to contest Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency, where Sinn Féin’s Michelle Gildernew is the MP. Tom Elliott of the UUP, who won the seat in 2015 before losing it back in 2017, has not yet confirmed if he will stand in the constituency.

The North Belfast seat held by Dodds is likely to come under pressure due to a pro-remain election pact. Photograph: Michael CooperPA Wire. Sinn Féin is to stand aside in three Northern constituencies in December’s general election and has urged its voters to back other candidates who support remaining in the European Union - including the independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon - to help defeat the pro-Brexit DUP. It is the latest of the North’s parties to declare that it will not run in certain constituencies in order to give another party the best chance of being elected. Of the North’s five main political parties, only Alliance has said it will not enter into any type of pact with another. Why has this happened? According to the parties, it is because of Brexit. Each of them have referenced the particular circumstances of this vote, with Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald describing it as a “once-in a generation election” where the “stakes are very high”. She said Sinn Féin, therefore, is “asking people to come out and vote for those pro-remain candidates” as it is “the right and progressive thing to do”. The SDLP spoke of an “extraordinary decision” for an “extraordinary election”, saying its “first priority is to elect pro-remain MPs to vote against Brexit and Boris Johnson but removing pro-Brexit MPs in Belfast is also critical”. For the UUP’s leader-elect, Steve Aiken, his earlier decision to run a candidate in North Belfast attracted vocal opposition from unionists in the area, not least from his own party. A police investigation is underway into threats, including some from loyalist paramilitaries, made against UUP members and staff. It was against this backdrop that Mr Aiken changed his mind, and the UUP now finds itself in the position of campaigning to remain in the EU yet calling on its voters to support pro-Brexit DUP candidate Nigel Dodds. Mr Aiken said the UUP was “a party which believes first and foremost in the Union” and that it was better to elect a DUP candidate than to “facilitate the election of an abstentionist Sinn Fein MP”. Yet as always in politics, there is much pragmatism. None of the parties had a realistic chance of winning in any of the constituencies they have opted not to stand in.What does this really mean? In North Belfast in 2017, Dodds held the seat for the DUP with a reduced majority of some 2,000 up against the challenge of Sinn Féin’s John Finucane. The SDLP’s withdrawal will help his chances, but even with his own vote from last time and the 2,000 votes from the SDLP candidate, Finucane still comes up 23 votes short of Dodds’ 2017 total. Both sides are likely to go all out to maximise turnout in what looks to be a very close race. The payoff for the SDLP is likely to come in South Belfast, where Claire Hanna, a popular MLA, appears well placed to unseat the DUP’s Emma Little-Pengelly. She defeated the former SDLP leader Alasdair McDonnell, who had held the seat since 2005, in 2017 with a majority of about 2,000 votes. Sinn Fein’s Máirtin Ó Muilleoir polled some 7,000 votes then, and a share of these should take Hanna comfortably over the line. The nationalist parties’ withdrawal from East Belfast will make little difference in the race between the sitting MP, the DUP’s Gavin Robinson, and the Alliance party leader and MEP, Naomi Long. Long was the constituency’s MP from 2010-15, but was some 8,000 votes behind Robinson in 2017. The 894 and 167 votes polled by Sinn Féin and the SDLP respectively will provide little by way of a boost. Lady Sylvia Hermon has been the North Down MP since 2001. She was originally an Ulster Unionist, but left the party in 2010 to become an independent Unionist. As Sinn Féin do not take their seats, since 2016 she has been the only pro-Remain MP at Westminster. With a majority of about 1,000, she faces a tight race, and again the absence of Sinn Féin and the SDLP - who polled less than 1,000 votes between them in 2017 - may make little difference. There is speculation that the DUP will seek to make political capital out of Sinn Féin’s endorsement of her candidacy, and that it may do her more harm than good. What about the bigger picture?Who knows what the breakdown of parties may look like come 13th December, but Northern Ireland appears set for certainly the most interesting general election for some time. The DUP currently holds 10 seats and Sinn Féin seven, with the remaining constituency represented by Lady Sylvia. The SDLP will be hoping to regain a presence at Westminster by retaking not just South Belfast, but Foyle, which it narrowly lost to Sinn Féin in 2017. While little is certain, even if just one seat changes hands - the most likely being South Belfast - it would see the leave-remain balance swing from 10-8 to 9-9. It would bring the unionist-nationalist breakdown among MPs to 10-8 if Finucane takes North Belfast, it would be 9-9, and the DUP would no longer be the largest party."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057998.1571674594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish times most nominated in newsbrands shortlist 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosita Boland with her trophy at the 2018 Newsbrands Ireland journalism awards Photograph: Simon CarswellThe  has received 32 nominations in the shortlist for the NewsBrands Journalism Awards 2019 – the highest number for a publication in this year’s competition.The NewsBrands Journalism Awards are open to any work published in print, website, online, mobile, video, audio or any other news delivery format from any NewsBrands Ireland member title.Five of the six journalists shortlisted in the Foreign Coverage category write for The : Sally Hayden Derek Scally Suzanne Lynch Lara Marlowe and Patrick Freyne.The  received four of the six nominations for Best Use of Video, citing the work of Simon Carswell, Kathleen Harris, Enda O’Dowd and Bryan O’Brien.Jack Power of The  was nominated in three categories Business Story of the Year Investigative Journalism and Young Journalist of the Year.  reporter Sarah Burns was also shortlisted as Young Journalist of the Year as was current  reporter Shauna Bowers for her past work at The Times, Ireland edition.Markets Correspondent Joe Brennan is shortlisted for Business Journalist of the Year.In the Campaigning Journalism category, The ’ No Child campaign has been shortlisted.Fintan O’Toole and Hilary Fannin are both nominated in the Broadsheet Columnist category, while in the Critic of the Year category The  has four writers shortlisted: Catherine Cleary Patrick Freyne Niamh Donnelly and Fintan O’Toole.Three  writers are shortlisted in the Features Broadsheet Writer of the Year: Rosita Boland, Conor Gallagher and Conor Pope.Carl O’Brien is nominated, along with Power, in the Investigative Journalism category.

around 11.6 million barrels per day, worth $719m at today’s market price.\u0026nbspThat volume of oil has made\u0026nbspAramco responsible for more global emissions than any other company in history by a comfortable margin, according to the Climate Accountability Network.Created with Sketch.Attack on major oil facilities in Saudi Arabia: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Smoke billows from multiple fires at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberThick black smoke billows from a fire following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaThe Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia prior to the drone strikes on 14 September Damage is seen to the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Smoke billows from multiple fires following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaSmoke rises from a fire following a drone strike at the Aramco facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberSmoke is seen following a fire at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberSmoke billows from multiple fires at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberThick black smoke billows from a fire following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaThe Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia prior to the drone strikes on 14 September Damage is seen to the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Smoke billows from multiple fires following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaSmoke rises from a fire following a drone strike at the Aramco facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberSmoke is seen following a fire at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberIt also presents the significant risk of so-called stranded assets such as oil fields and refineries which are highly valued today but may quickly become worthless as the world’s energy needs switch away from fossil fuels.\u0026nbspYasir al-Rumayyan, the chairman of Saudi Aramco, said on Sunday: “Today marks a significant milestone in the history of the company and important progress towards delivering Saudi Vision 2030, the kingdom’s blueprint for sustained economic ersification and growth.”The sale will be a publicity coup and a financial boost for Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Mohammad bin Salman, who is attempting to present a more modern vision for the conservative kingdom while decreasing its reliance on oil.Saudi Arabia hopes to raise around $40-$45bn from the sale of a 1 per cent to 2 per cent stake. Much of the cash is likely to flow into the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which has bought stakes in a host of companies including Uber.\u0026nbspBanks and advisors will also collect hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for their role in getting the Aramco share sale over the line.The shares will debut on Saudia Arabia’s stock market, the Tadawul, dashing hopes on Wall Street and in the City of London, which had been vying to win a share of the lucrative listing.Plans for a dual listing have been put on hold but may be revived in future.\u0026nbspThe importance of Aramco to world oil supplies was underlined in September when drone attacks on its oil plants sent the oil prices soaring.A temporary shutdown at the Abqaiq and Khurais plants after the attacks temporarily took out more than 5 per cent of global oil production.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Instead, it is intended to distinguish the parent company from all of those apps, and stress that Facebook owns a variety of different products.Users may not know that some apps – such as Instagram or cryptocurrency platform Calibra – are actually made by Facebook, the company suggested, and the new branding should help change that.People should know which companies make the products they use. Our main services include the Facebook app, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, Workplace, Portal and Calibra, wrote\u0026nbspAntonio Lucio, chief marketing officer, in a blog post.These apps and technologies have shared infrastructure for years and the teams behind them frequently work together.The new logo could also have the effect of distancing Facebook the company from its controversial app and website, which have been dragged into a variety of different privacy scandals in recent times.It will start rolling out in different ways in the future, Facebook said.

Since then it has been moving away from Earth, and almost exactly a year ago it passed out of the sun’s protective bubble and into interstellar space.When it did, it became only the second\u0026nbspman-made object to travel outside the limits of our sun’s influence and into the “interstellar medium”. Its sibling Voyager 1 did so six years earlier, because it is on a different trajectory and moving faster.Scientists have now revealed what they learnt from that mission out into the furthest reaches of our cosmic neighbourhood.In a series of papers published in the Nature Astronomy, researchers confirmed the spacecraft’s journey into the “space between the stars” by noting a “definitive jump” in the density of the plasma – made up of charged particles and gas – in interstellar space.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created

SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberAccording to the scientists, this jump was detected by one of the instruments on Voyager 2 and is evidence of the probe making its way “from the hot, lower density plasma characteristic of the solar wind to the cool, higher-density plasma of interstellar space”.It is also similar to the plasma density jump experienced by Voyager 1 when it crossed into interstellar space, the researchers added.Nasa’s pioneering Voyager 2 has left the Solar SystemAmong many things, the astronomers are looking to gain a better understanding of how the solar winds – the stream of charge particles coming out of the sun – interact with the interstellar winds – made up of particles from other stars.Dr Edward Stone, a professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology and former director of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said: “We are trying to understand the nature of the boundary where these two winds collide.”The astronomers believe the probes’ journeys – with their different mission goals and trajectories – give “valuable clues” about the structure of the heliosphere – a vast bubble encompassing the sun and the solar system.Bill\u0026nbspKurth, a research scientist at the University of Iowa and one of the authors of the studies, said: “It implies that the heliosphere is symmetric, at least at the two points where the Voyager spacecraft crossed.”In one of the papers, the researchers suggest that the interstellar medium near the\u0026nbspheliopause\u0026nbsp- the boundary where the sun’s solar winds are\u0026nbspstopped by the interstellar medium – is hotter than expected, with a temperature of around 29,000-49,000C.In another study, a different team reported the presence of layers “on both sides of the\u0026nbspheliopause”.While scientists were aware of the inner layer, the presence of the outer layer became evident only after Voyager 2 crossed into interstellar space.The researchers said evidence gathered by both probes show that the interstellar medium, along with the\u0026nbspheliopause\u0026nbspand the interstellar magnetic fields, “form a complex interconnected dynamical system”.The Voyagers were sent initially to study the outer planets including Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, but then just kept on going.Even though they made it out of the sun’s bubble, astronomers maintain that the Voyagers are still technically in the solar system because it stretches to the outer edge of the\u0026nbspOort\u0026nbspcloud – comprising water ice, ammonia and methane – which surrounds the sun.Dr Stone said the crafts’ plutonium power sources will eventually stop supplying electricity, at which point their instruments and their transmitters will die.He added: “In another five years or so we may not have enough scientific instruments to power it any longer.”Dr\u0026nbspKurth\u0026nbspbelieves that both Voyagers “will outlast Earth”, adding: “They’re in their own orbits around the galaxy for five billion years or longer. And the probability of them running into anything is almost zero.”Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

around 11.6 million barrels per day, worth $719m at today’s market price.\u0026nbspThat volume of oil has made\u0026nbspAramco responsible for more global emissions than any other company in history by a comfortable margin, according to the Climate Accountability Network.Created with Sketch.Attack on major oil facilities in Saudi Arabia: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Smoke billows from multiple fires at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberThick black smoke billows from a fire following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaThe Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia prior to the drone strikes on 14 September Damage is seen to the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Smoke billows from multiple fires following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaSmoke rises from a fire following a drone strike at the Aramco facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberSmoke is seen following a fire at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberSmoke billows from multiple fires at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberThick black smoke billows from a fire following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaThe Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia prior to the drone strikes on 14 September Damage is seen to the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Smoke billows from multiple fires following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaSmoke rises from a fire following a drone strike at the Aramco facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberSmoke is seen following a fire at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberIt also presents the significant risk of so-called stranded assets such as oil fields and refineries which are highly valued today but may quickly become worthless as the world’s energy needs switch away from fossil fuels.\u0026nbspYasir al-Rumayyan, the chairman of Saudi Aramco, said on Sunday: “Today marks a significant milestone in the history of the company and important progress towards delivering Saudi Vision 2030, the kingdom’s blueprint for sustained economic ersification and growth.”The sale will be a publicity coup and a financial boost for Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Mohammad bin Salman, who is attempting to present a more modern vision for the conservative kingdom while decreasing its reliance on oil.Saudi Arabia hopes to raise around $40-$45bn from the sale of a 1 per cent to 2 per cent stake. Much of the cash is likely to flow into the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which has bought stakes in a host of companies including Uber.\u0026nbspBanks and advisors will also collect hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for their role in getting the Aramco share sale over the line.The shares will debut on Saudia Arabia’s stock market, the Tadawul, dashing hopes on Wall Street and in the City of London, which had been vying to win a share of the lucrative listing.Plans for a dual listing have been put on hold but may be revived in future.\u0026nbspThe importance of Aramco to world oil supplies was underlined in September when drone attacks on its oil plants sent the oil prices soaring.A temporary shutdown at the Abqaiq and Khurais plants after the attacks temporarily took out more than 5 per cent of global oil production.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the colony the researchers found was unusual, as it was composed entirely of worker ants and had no obvious available food source.Now, scientists from the Museum and Institute of Zoology at\u0026nbspthe Polish Academy of Sciences, in Warsaw, have deduced that the thriving community was sustained by cannibalism, and that the ants in the bunker were an accidental offshoot of a larger colony living at ground level near small ventilation pipes leading into the subterranean bunker.When they were first found, the scientists estimated the presence of close to a million inidual ants.\u0026nbspThe insects ended up in this situation as a result of large numbers accidentally falling down the ventilation pipe and being unable to climb back up to their nest.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Insects at risk of extinction Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Wasps are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskDragonflies are of the order Odonata, one of the most at riskBees are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskButterflies are of the order Lepidoptera, one of the most at risk Ants are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskCaddisflies make up the order Trichoptera, one of the most at riskStoneflies are of the order plecoptera, one of the most at risk Saw-Flies are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskMoths are of the order Lepidoptera, one of the most at risk Damselflies are of the order Odonata, one of the most at riskMayflies are of the order Ephemeroptera, one of the most at risk Wasps are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskDragonflies are of the order Odonata, one of the most at riskBees are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskButterflies are of the order Lepidoptera, one of the most at risk Ants are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskCaddisflies make up the order Trichoptera, one of the most at riskStoneflies are of the order plecoptera, one of the most at risk Saw-Flies are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskMoths are of the order Lepidoptera, one of the most at risk Damselflies are of the order Odonata, one of the most at riskMayflies are of the order Ephemeroptera, one of the most at risk Several years later, the ants in the bunker still appeared to be thriving, prompting an investigation into how this was possible.In a newly published paper, Professor Wojciech Czechowski and Dr István Maák said their investigations revealed the wood ants were consuming the dead bodies of their fallen comrades that were accumulating on the bunker floor.\u0026nbspIn nature, a similar behaviour occurs frequently during spring, when protein food is scarce.\u0026nbspNeighbouring colonies\u0026nbspengage in so-called “ant wars”, which set territorial boundaries and also provide food in the form of the fresh corpses.Woman bitten by mystery insect has legs and fingertips amputated Pentagon ordered to reveal whether it used ticks as biological weaponsBritain is not immune to the ‘insect armageddon’Recent research has also shown that corpse consumption among wood ants is more common than previously thought, and that even the corpses of their nest-mates can serve as an important food source – and not only in periods of food shortage.“Here we show that the ‘colony’ in the bunker survived and grew thanks to an influx of workers from the source nest above the bunker and mass consumption of corpses of the imprisoned nest-mates,” the authors said.In 2016, the scientists experimented with creating a bridge for the ants to allow them to return to the original colony. At first they allowed a hundred iniduals to regain access to the nest, where they saw they were accepted as belonging to the larger, original colony.After this success they made the bridge permanent, and more recent visits to the bunker have revealed very small numbers of ants still living down there, with the vast majority believed to have returned to the original nest.The research is published in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A spokesperson for the European Commission told reporters in Brussels that the meeting had come at a request from the former prime minister’s office, and would not confirm whether Brexit or a second referendum would be discussed.The outgoing Commission president also reiterated his attack on Boris Johnson, who he claimed had lied during the referendum campaign.“So many lies were told, including by current prime minister, Boris Johnson, that there needed to be a voice to counter them,” Mr Juncker said. The Luxembourgish politician has said several times since the referendum that he wishes he had got involved in the campaign to rebut untruths emanating from the Leave side.The Blair government’s flagship European integration policy was its “five tests” that kept Britain out of the European single currency.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This means it is unlikely to be published before Tuesday, when parliament rises, and therefore\u0026nbspnot until the after election on 12\u0026nbspDecember.The government’s arguments have been dismissed by a number of senior former public officials including former cabinet secretary Lord Butler,\u0026nbspLord Ricketts, former national security advisor and chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee,\u0026nbspand Lord Anderson, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation.Created with Sketch.Top 10 marginal seats to watch at the general election Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 2Currently held by Labour with a majority of 20310 Perth and North PerthshireCurrently held by the SNP with a majority of 21Currently held by independent, formerly Labour, MP Ian Austin with a majority of 22Currently held by Labour with a majority of 30Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 31Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 45810 Crewe and NantwichCurrently held by Labour with a majority of 48Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 60Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 75Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 2Currently held by Labour with a majority of 20310 Perth and North PerthshireCurrently held by the SNP with a majority of 21Currently held by independent, formerly Labour, MP Ian Austin with a majority of 22Currently held by Labour with a majority of 30Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 31Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 45810 Crewe and NantwichCurrently held by Labour with a majority of 48Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 60Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 75Security and intelligence service officials say they are in the dark over why the report has not been published.One told The Independent: “We are as much spectators in this as you are. All the redactions necessary have been done and no last-minute issues have arisen. We have no objections to the report being published now.”The report cannot be published without the approval of the prime minister.Dominic Grieve, chair of the ISC said: “I cannot think of a reason why he should wish to prevent this report being published. It’s very demoralising for us when we find we put in months of work and, at the end of it, we’re not getting an adequate response.“It seems to us that this report is germane because we do know – and I think it is widely accepted –\u0026nbspthat the Russians have sought to interfere in other countries’ democratic processes in the past.\u0026nbspThe protocols are quite clear. If the prime minister has a good reason for preventing publication he should explain to the committee what it is, and do it within 10 days of him receiving the report. If not it should be published.”\u0026nbspLord Ricketts said: “The ISC are a highly professional committee and their reports are always worth reading. Since this has apparently already been redacted by the intelligence agencies there can be no national security reasons to delay publication.”\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The ISC need PM’s agreement before it can publish. So the issue is NOT Govt needing time to respond. Just publish it!...Their response comes later.”In a Lords question on Monday afternoon Lord Anderson, a crossbencher, asked why there “has been unjustified delay” in getting confirmation of publication from Downing Street, when normal practice is that such confirmation is “always a formality”.The peer commented that Downing Street’s\u0026nbspposition raised “suspicion of the government and its motives”. He pointed out that, contrary to what is being claimed by No 10, full redactions have taken place in liaison with the intelligence services and the Cabinet Office. He also stressed that the government does not normally give its response along with such reports, but later, having 60 days to do so.Lord Butler, also a crossbencher, told the house that the “process of clearing this report started on 28\u0026nbspMarch, seven months ago, and it was only the final stage, of being cleared by the prime minister which started in October.” He continued: “Surely the whole point of this report is that it is relevant to a general election coming up. The government should make a particular effort to make sure that it is in the public domain.”The Labour peer, Baroness Hayter asked “ What has the prime minister got to hide?”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pelicans in St James\u0027s Park in central LondonDancers perform a mass Ghoomar dance during Diwali celebrations in Trafalgar Square, LondonCampaigners listen as SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon addresses a rally calling for Scottish independence in GlasgowPolice and recovery workers remove a damaged bus from the scene of a crash in Sevenoaks Road, south-east London.

An analysis by cybersecurity firm F-Secure indicated that “suspicious activity” relating to Brexit-related posts on Twitter has continued after the referendum and continued this year.Questions have been asked about alleged Russia-related\u0026nbspbusiness activities of Arron Banks, the largest donor to the Brexit campaign, and a number meetings he and a colleague, Andy Wigmore, have had with Russian diplomats in London.Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore have firmly denied any collusion with Russia or Russian-backed enterprises.Substantial sums have been donated to the Conservative Party by wealthy Russians. These include\u0026nbspLubov Chemukhin, the wife of Vladimir Chernikhin, a former ally of Russian president\u0026nbspVladimir Putin, who paid £160,000 to the party in return for a game of tennis with Boris Johnson.In March 2018 the Conservative Party refused appeals by, among others, Marina Litvinenko, the widow of Alexander Litvinenko, allegedly murdered on orders of the Kremlin, to return £820,000 donated by various wealthy Russians.It pointed out that all who had given the money had been carefully vetted and were, by then, UK citizens.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That is in keeping with large amounts of data gathered from telescopes peering deep into space, including readings from the European Space Agency\u0027s Planck Telescope.But in a newly published paper, researchers note that the latest release of data from the same Planck telescope gave different readings than expected under our standard understanding of the universe. Those could be explained by the fact the universe is closed, the authors write – which would help explain issues with the readings.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberScientists find they don’t know how fast the universe is expandingTo resolve the problem, further research will be required to understand whether we have simply not detected another piece of the puzzle, or are simply a statistical fluctuation. But they could also suggest that we are lacking a new physics that is yet to be discovered, they write.The shape of the universe affects some of our most fundamental understanding of existence, deciding the geometry of how the cosmos is assembled.In a flat universe, parallel lines will run forever, just like if you draw a set of them onto a sheet of paper. But if it is not flat, they intersect: if you draw two parallel lines onto a spherical object like a football, for instance, they run into each other on the other side.Scientists have long been convinced the universe was shaped like that sheet of paper. But the new paper suggests that could be wrong, and it is not flat but rather closed.The authors of the new paper say that if it is correct that the data from the Planck telescope suggests we are inside of a closed universe, it introduces a new problem for modern cosmology.Part of the issue is a consequence of the fact that our current precise understanding of the cosmos is arrived it by combining different datasets – measuring different things in different ways – together. Scientists generally assume that those datasets are consistent, and come from the same cosmological model.But some of those datasets are actually in contradiction with each other. There has been intense discussion of exactly how fast the universe is expanding, for instance, and measurements from the Planck telescope have been in contradiction with others.Scientists have tried to reconcile these differences with alterations to our understanding of physics, or to suggest that there might not be quite such a difference as thought. But those attempts have generally relied on the assumption of a flat universe, the authors write, and that may be incorrect.The researchers revealed their findings in a paper, \u0027Planck evidence for a closed Universe and a possible crisis for cosmology\u0027, which has just been published in\u0026nbspNature Astronomy.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Stems are stripped by hand and the grain pounded into flour which is slowly mixed with boiling water to make two, a thick white paste which is a staple across the region. Alternatively, water can be added to the flour to make porridge. 1217 Drought tolerant cassava grown at the Red Cross market gardenDuring the lean season a shortage in food forces the prices up to unaffordable amounts for many families. The market garden helps the local community to grow their own food and helps to stabilise prices during the lean season.1317 34-year-old Ouma Azzika with goat she was given from the Niger Red CrossOuma Azzika has seven children to feed.

Are these two really the brightest and the best  Obviously not. But with politics becoming ever more isive and toxic, they are all we have left.Let’s be honest. What normal human being would want to be part of such a cesspit  As we are all well aware, the past three years have seen a constipated parliament unable, or unwilling, to sort out Brexit, forcing us all into a nightmarish version of Groundhog Day.I believe the idea of a European referendum was the height of stupidity by a spooked David Cameron who wanted to neuter Nigel Farage. When the nation voted Leave, Cameron was the first to abandon ship.Never mind “women and children first”. He was rowing away from a Titanic mess in a leboat stuffed with like-minded, snivelling clowns, leaving poor Theresa May behind playing an out-of-tune piano with the rest of the ship’s doomed orchestra. Mrs May foolishly called an election that was a personal disaster, then was worn down until she had to step aside.Boris Johnson thought he could bluster and blag his way to a solution and promised we would exit the EU a couple of days ago, on Halloween. For all his blather about “dying in a ditch”, he couldn’t deliver.So here we are, facing a pre-Christmas election at a time when distrust of politicians has never been higher and our expectations have been never lower. It is easy to dismiss the whole bloody lot of them as a waste of time.But there ARE some decent MPs who want to make a dference. Sadly, some are unwilling to put up with the scrutiny and vilication the job now entails and many are heading out the door.Female MPs, in particular, have been subjected to online abuse that chills the blood. As well as death threats, they have had to deal with vile monsters threatening rape and other violent attacks. It’s horric to have to cope with such hideous abuse on a daily basis. I can’t blame them for quitting in despair.Their fears are real. We saw that with the tragic murder of MP Jo Cox in . She was a we and mother who wanted to make the world a better place and do the best possible job for her constituents. It’s a real pity the MPs now calling it a day are mainly moderates who were calm ­voices of reason amid all the shrieking and howling from extremists on both sides of the political ide.Heidi Allen, a Tory who joined the Lib Dems, can no longer cope with the “nastiness and intimidation” which has become the norm in Parliament. Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan is leaving because the abuse towards her has had a “clear impact” on her ­family.The Tory and the Labour leaderships should hang their heads in shame at allowing such an appalling situation to develop. They should have called off their attack dogs and clamped down on cowardly online trolls.There have always been robust arguments and passionate debates in politics — but nothing like the sheer hatred and aggression Brexit has unleashed. MPs were used to attacks from opposing parties. But now some of the worst abuse comes from inside.Left-wing extremists threaten deselection for Labour MPs who even whisper about their discontent with Corbyn. Tories find themselves booted out for failing to toe the line. Sadly, the next six weeks will see even more of this aggression as we have to listen to hate-filled rants and ­ludicrous, undeliverable ­promises to secure our votes.It is strange to think that Westminster was respected and admired not so very long ago. I honestly don’t think those days will ever . We deserve so much better.SOME welcome good news comes in the form of Richard and Judy, who will pop back on to our TV screens to front the show they helped make such a huge success.It was meant to be a one-off when they presented This Morning a couple of weeks ago. But viewers were so excited, “R and J” have an open invitation to .The stumbling block has always been because Judy was reluctant toto live national TV. But Richard told me this week she really enjoyed herself and loved reconnecting with This Morning’s loyal audience.Richard was quick to stress that they are not after anyone’s jobs or in the market for a permanent– but it would be lovely to pop in now and again. I’m delighted. They are both total pros who make it all look delightfully easy and relaxed.They also have the sort of public affection only enjoyed by the Queen and Dame Judi Dench.IT is heartbreaking to think Ben Needham would have turned  this week. He has been for ever frozen in time as that little blond toddler playing in the Greek sunshine before going missing on Kos back in .Brave mum Kerry has never once stopped fighting to discover the truth. Three years ago, British police finally conducted a thorough investigation.They believe Ben was killed in an accident involving a digger on a building site on the island, where his grandad worked and close to where the family lived at the time. Despite handing over their evidence to authorities on the island, there have been no further attempts to find Ben’s body.Poor Kerry should have been celebrating her grown-up son’s milestone birthday, perhaps with her daughter-in-law and grandchildren. Instead, her agony ­continues.She has no closure, no grave to visit and is no nearer to finding out exactly what happened to her son almost three decades ago.I CAN’T wait to see what Michelle Visage and Giovanni Pernice have in store for us on Strictly Come Dancing. Last week their Halloween routine was perfection and Michelle foxtrotted around the floor like a gothic goddess.She was my tip to make the final even before the first steps were taken in this year’s competition. I knew Michelle had the sass, talent and work ethic to go all the way. I love that she’s flying the flag for the over-s while exuding buckets of sex appeal.Don’t forget that for years Michelle suffered with a serious autoimmune disease she believes was caused by her breast implants. She has only just recovered from surgery to have them removed.Michelle is a steel magnolia and the best is yet to come. So make sure you give her and Giovanni your vote.A HUGE thank you to everyone who has been so positive about Shine, my book out this week.With my th birthday coming up at the end of this month, it felt like a good time to reflect and take stock. I also wanted to share all of the knowledge and advice I’ve acquired from so many of the guests and experts I’ve met over the  years I’ve been on TV.So I decided to put it all into a book that will hopefully give useful tips and information to make your le better. I want it to be a book you can have by your bedside, to dip into when you need a bit of a confidence boost or advice on looking good and feeling great.I’m doing some signings on Saturday, so do pop in and say hello at WH Smith in Glasgow’s St Enoch Centre at noon and at Waterstones on Princes Street in Edinburgh at pm.I WAS in the US last week, going through astronaut training at Nasa. I will tell you about that very soon. But I also managed a couple of days to recover in Florida’s Key West. My husband and I had no idea that at this time of year there is a little event called Fantasy Fest. Well. What an eye-opener that was.Some brave souls were out and about in nothing more than expertly applied body paint. I was a bit bemused at first and obviously I refrained from joining in.But it is amazing how quickly you get used to someone wearing nothing but a leather posing pouch standing at the bar talking to you about the latest Trump baloney.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was called “man”.He was hemmed in on all sides by giant deserts he couldn’t cross because, at this point, God had not invented the Land Rover. But it didn’t matter back then because this part of the world was full of all the food and water the mans and womans would ever need.It was lush, green and beautul. Everyone was very happy. Now, imaginethey’d known the planet was about to wobble on its axis, which would cause us to start on an all-new orbit around the sun.Imagine the panic.

All the usual routes to the ­watering holes and fruit trees would have been blocked by ­activists in weird costumes saying a whole new way of le had to be adopted to stave off disaster.Everyone would have been told to go vegan and stop wearing shoes made from leather. But they didn’t know the Earth was about to wobble. They just woke up one morning to find the climate had changed.It was warmer and wetter. In fact, there was so much rain, the deserts surrounding them came to le. This meant they could explore strange new worlds and boldly go where no one had gone before.They moved to Europe and Asia. They spread out across the seas and soon, they came up with ­literature and agriculture and architecture and medicine. They became civilised and happy and healthy. And then they started going on holidays and drinking beer and laughing on the way home from the pub with their friends and a delicious kebab.And then they got next-day delivery on anything they wanted and a new smartphone every year and Instagram. One day, a tall man with a motoring show on the television was even able to drive a Lancia right across the salt pans where it all began. And all of that was possible thanks to a big, juicy lump of global warming.That’s the thing about climate change. We keep being told the next sht will be a disaster for mankind. But who knows  You might wake up one morning to find your garden full of unicorns and mermaids and big chests full of jewels and money.LOTS of people are wondering why Jeremy Corbyn took so long to agree to an election. But the answer is simple.Corbyn knew the longer he could stall Brexit, the more damage would be done to the one thing he hates more than everything : Britain. He’s always sided with anyone who wants to do us harm. The IRA. Hamas. Russia. You name it.He wants everyone in those camps in Calais to come here because he knows it will destabilise our way of le. In fact, every one of his policies is designed specically to ruin the country.Because that’s what the bitter and twisted weasel wants. Mind you, the Shadow Chancellor is even worse.Which isn’t strictly trueyou’ve got a one-off Ferrari  Speciale MM. APPARENTLY Daniel Craig was fed up with saying: “The name’s Bond. James Bond.” Well, I’m sorry, my precious, but you’re not getting any sympathy here. If you’ve worked in a poultry farm for  years, you can say you’re fed up with chickens.Andyou’ve worked on the railways all your adult le, you can say you are looking forward to a retirement without trains. But you, Mr Craig, only said that line FIVE times. Which is hardly taxing, is it No matter. There’s talk about who will replace him in the role. And because Bond is so woke and #MeToo these days, we cannot rule out the possibility that the role will be given to Diane Abbott or Janet Street-Porter.Some of me hopes he really does die in the new movie, as has been rumoured. Buthe doesn’t, might I suggest the part is given to a chap called Geoffrey Moore, top I met him at a party once and was impressed by his louche, charming style, his clever eyebrow work and his bright orange skin that even David Dickinson would call “over the top”.I’m not sure he can act. But that doesn’t matter because neither could his father Roger . . . and he was the best Bond of them all.BAD news. It seems the plug has been pulled on the hotly anticipated prequel to Game Of Thrones.They had a stellar cast including the brilliant Naomi Watts. And it was being written by Jane Goldman, the brains behind Kick-Ass and Kingsman. And her husband Jonathan Ross.HBO, though, has obviously decided the end result won’t work, which begs a question: How can they know I’ve worked in television for  years butsomeone came to me and said: “We have a show featuring an old lady baking cakes” I’d have put their ideas in a big bag of rubbish, along with that hare-brained scheme to stage a prime-time dancing competition.GATWICK airport is set to roll out a new system to cut boarding times and reduce delays.Sounds clever, yes.

Nor is he remotely likely to hold the balance of power.There is no longer a route to the No Deal Brexit he wants. Nor any prospect of Boris Johnson caving to his demands for a pact, destroying the Tories’ unity. And it is patently untrue to say Boris’s deal is not Brexit. The Tory ERG simply wouldn’t back itso.It will end our membership, payments and free movement and extract us from the customs union and single market, with no “backstop” keeping us half-in. We would trade freely as an independent nation. And Boris alone can get us out. The sole alternative as PM is Corbyn, and he will keep us in the EU for ever.In a few constituencies Farage’s party could hurt Labour more than the Tories. Overall it is FAR more likely to prevent Boris winning the majority which is vital to delivering Brexit and without which it is lost. That is why Farage’s ultimatum to the PM delighted Labour.Two by-elections — in Peterborough and Brecon, both of which the Tories should have won — were gted to Labour and the Lib Dems by Brexit Party votes. On December , those could put Corbyn in Downing Street in a Remain coalition.At which point Farage’s legacy won’t just be that his vanity wrecked his le’s work.That a party he founded with only one aim, a real Brexit, became the very instrument of the project’s destruction.He will be remembered as the right-wing maverick who handed anti-Semitic, anti-Western Marxists an unprecedented chance to plunder the world’s fth-largest economy. The Sun admires Farage.His pressure brought about the referendum AND a better deal. But he could now be the author of a double national catastrophe.He and his voters should think again.WE’VE heard it all now.Labour’s Tom ­Watson, of all people, insists broadcasters must combat the Tories’ “fake news”.That’s the same Tom Watson who destroyed lives spreading a paedophile’s lies.Whose party’s campaign centres on a blatant fiction about Boris “selling the NHS to Trump”.Whose leader lies endlessly about his terrorist sympathies and anti-Semitism — then sinisterly orders reporters: “Just report what we say.”These charlatans lecture journalists about the truth.But they themselves are strangers to it.Andthey took power, Press freedom would be a nostalgic memory.The Sun joins everyone rooting for Owen and England’s rugby heroes.Best of ruck, lads!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But oddly,  is one of the things that mean the Tories might win that majority this time round. They are determined not to make the same mistakes again. As one senior party figure puts it: “We screwed it up once. We’re not going to do that again.”When Chancellor Sajid Javid spoke to Tory MPs on Wednesday night, he reassured them that “this campaign will not be like last time”. He described Theresa May’s  effort as “the most incompetent election campaign in modern times”.In , the Tories assumed that their chunky poll lead would easily translate into a big majority. There was a complacency and cockiness about their campaign. There was no ­rationale for why Mrs May was going back on her pledge not to have an election and a belief that the Tories could use that lead to win a mandate for almost anything.This time round, the Tories are being much more cautious. The groundwork has been laid for this campaign. Conservative Campaign HQ has been getting election-ready for months. The Tories have heavy-hitters ready to join their ­campaign team, including Paul Stephenson, one of the key ­figures from Vote Leave’s  victory. In , Mrs May took her own party machine by ­surprise with her decision to go to the country.In another dference with the ex-PM, Boris Johnson has a clear argument for why an ­election is needed — the only thing this Parliament is capable of on Brexit is delay. It is hard to see how anyone who wants Brexit and has seen what has happened since the  election could disagree with that.This Tory desire not to screw up will also lead to more ­discipline. This time, the ­manesto will be a cautious document, not an attempt to gain a mandate for a series of deeply unpopular reforms. The fact that everyone knows this election will be close helps the Tories too. There’ll be much more scrutiny of what a Corbyn premiership would mean than there was in .Cabinet Ministers believe that the prospect of a Labour SNP deal which would see Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish Nationalists help Corbyn into Downing Street in exchange for another independence referendum is already cutting through, and particularly in Scotland, where the Tories are increasingly ­confident they can limit their losses to five seats or fewer.But perhaps the biggest dference from  is between Johnson and May. May had never done a ­national campaign before, she disliked big events and preferred going door to door. Boris, by contrast, is a showman who has already ­successfully fronted one nationwide effort, the  referendum. Boris knows how to make himself the centre of attention in a way Mrs May never did.As one Cabinet minister puts it: “Boris is ­capable of stealing the oxygen from all the other candidates.”The most signicant threat to the Tories is pro-Remain tactical voting. The big question, frets one Cabinet minister, is whether Labour and the Lib Dems end up splitting the ­centre-left vote and letting the Tories win — as happened with Labour and the SDP in  — or whether there is anti-Tory voting that condemns scores of previously safe Tory MPs to defeat — as happened in .Butthe Tories avoid the pitfalls of , then even from a much less promising starting position they should be able to win a majority.THIS election will see the first ever head-to-head televised leaders’ debate between the two big parties. On November , Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson will clash in primetime on ITV. Both Labour and the Tories think they will benefit from this one-on-one format.On the Labour side, they hope that it helps them unite the anti-Tory vote behind Corbyn. The Tories think the question of who you want to be Prime Minister – Johnson or Corbyn – favours them.During the  campaign, Theresa May lost her lead on this question. But right now, Boris Johnson has a -point advantage over Corbyn. If he can maintain anything like this margin, he’ll still be in No  come Christmas.Downing Street also thinks that making this election a forced choice between a Tory government and a Labour government works to their benefit. Polling for Conservative Campaign HQ shows that half of voters want the Tories in government in some way, compared to just over a quarter for Labour.They calculate that making the election a choice between Johnson and Corbyn helps them squeeze the Brexit Party vote down – something which is particularly important given Nigel Farage’s determination to put up candidates right across the country.Influential Tories are also worried thatthe Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson turns in a barnstorming performance, her party could threaten the Tories in their shire seats.Johnson himself will not do the seven-way debate between the party leaders. The Tories are keen to downplay the importance of this event. I’m told they are considering sending Sajid Javid, Michael Gove, Priti Patel or Rishi Sunak.THE “moratorium” announced on fracking today is a sign of the Tories’ safety-first approach going into this election. They want to close down issues that could cost them seats.One minister defends the decision to abandon the effort to improve the UK’s energy security by saying: “The reality is, it wasn’t happening.”But a bigger factor was their desire not to go into the election with this as a potential vulnerability.I understand that, in stark contrast to , the manesto will be a cautious document designed to prevent handing ammunition to Labour.AT CABINET on Tuesday, Boris Johnson called the Scottish Secretary Alister Jack to speak.An embarrassed Jack explained that he wasn’t actually trying to get in, to which Johnson replied he thought his hand was up.Jack, a multi-millionaire who owns a large farm, then quipped to laughter: “That’s why my farm manager doesn’t let me go to auctions.”THE Tories are planning to accuse Labour of staging a massive raid on the pension pots of million voters.This would hurt the .million who contribute to a private ­pension. Afterwards, one Tory told me Javid’s message was clear: “Labour are coming after your money.”I understand the Tories are also preparing a “tax bombshell” attack on Corbyn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But they never got one vote from our house. And I have been thinking of my parents over the past few days and wondering: Would they have broken the habit of a letime and voted for Boris Johnson Because that is the key to who wins this General Election. We hear a lot about how Boris has to woo “Workington Man” — “an older, white, non-graduate male from the north of England with an interest in rugby league and a tendency to vote Labour”. But it is not just Workington Man who holds the keys to  Downing Street now.From one end of the country to the other, it is all those voters such as my mum and dad, who never voted Tory before. That is who Boris has to woo and win. Those millions of Tory virgins.The polls all suggest there is a massive majority for parties which favour leaving the European Union. Butthat vote is split between the Tories and Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, then we don’t get Brexit.We get Jeremy Corbyn gurning on the steps of No. We get an economy in ruins. We get Venezuela without the nice weather.  But splitting the Leave vote is not a strategy for delivering Brexit. It is a cast-iron guarantee that Brexit is cancelled. If you want to see the result of the Referendum, you have to vote Tory.My mum and dad would not have recognised the rotten Labour Party of today. They would have been baffled, then angered, by the total absence of anything resembling patriotism among Corbyn and his Marxist mob.My parents would have scratched their heads at Labour’s immigration policy — to allow “as much free movement as possible” — not because they disliked foreigners but because they thought the identity of their country was worth preserving.My folks would never have trusted a grizzled old Marxist like John McDonnell with their hard-earned wages. They would have been wary of seeing the police force supervised by Diane Abbott.They would have noted Emily Thornberry sneering at the flag of St George while happily adorning herself in the EU flag. They would not understand how Corbyn could happily lick the sandals of Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA.My parents — the kind of people who fought our wars, paid their taxes for a letime and built this country up from the rubble — would not have spat on this Labour Party. And after years of seeing Parliament place itself above the people, they would have crawled across broken glass to get to the polling booth on December .My parents believed in democracy. They had no doubts about the importance of voting. They would never have voted for Jeremy Corbyn. But would they have seen that the Conservative Party is now their natural home That’s your historic task now, Boris — convince the millions of working-class patriots like my mum and dad that you truly understand their lives. Andyou can do that, you will win a landslide.We have heard a lot about the failure of fire chiefs and their policy of “stay put” which added to the death toll of .But there has not been nearly enough focus on the heroism of the firefighters who were there on that hellish night.Firefighters put their lives on the line for strangers.Yes, that is their job. But their job deserves our unequivocal respect and gratitude.PRESENTER Samira Ahmed is suing her employers at the BBC for £, in pay because she received a fraction of what Jeremy Vine was paid for allegedly “similar” work.I like Samira Ahmed on Newswatch and wish her well.But Jeremy Vine is far more of a household name. And when it comes to getting paid, star power matters more than gender.I would like to be banking the same royalty cheques for my books as JK Rowling. But best not to hold my breath.IN the Eighties I did a story on the politan Police’s Vice Squad, which logged the contents of the pornographic videos they seized while watching the raunchy action in fast-forward.I can still recall the bored, joyless expressions of the young Vice Squad coppers as they yawned through all that fast-forwarded filth.Now Netflix is offering the same sort of thing – aallowing viewers to watch shows at up to one-and-a-half times the normal speed. Don’t bother.If it’s not worth watching in real time, it’s not worth watching at all.THERE are million dog owners in the UK and I can’t have been the only one who cringed to hear President Trump boasting that IS monster Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had “died like a dog”. And exactly how does a dog die, Mr President In my experience, a dog dies surrounded by humans who feel as though they have just had their heart torn out. A dog dies surrounded by love. A dog dies bitterly mourned by the family it leaves behind.According to Trump, the IS leader, “whimpered, cried and screamed like a coward . . . in utter fear, panic and dread”. My dog is not going out of this world like that. When our Stan finally goes, many years from now, he will be in my arms and looking in my eyes.Death will be painless and peaceful. It will be a moment of love and grief. Who writes your lousy material, Donald  All this “dying like a dog” rubbish felt stupidly off-the-cuff.While the world is mightily glad to see the back of a mass murderer, the florid violence of Donald Trump’s language sounded exactly like the kind of crass rhetoric we hear from terrorists.The President’s sneering “died like a dog” line was particularly misjudged because American special forces were helped in their ultra-dangerous mission by military search dogs.They pursued al-Baghdadi right up to the moment he detonated his suicide vest, injuring one of the brave dogs – a Belgian Malinois named Conan – who will be honoured at the White House next week.Kill all the terrorists you like, Mr President. But there is really no need to talk like one.THE traditional Guy Fawkes Night celebrations of my childhood have largely been replaced by Halloween.This makes me incredibly sad, although my we says Halloween is far less dangerous than all the bonfires and bangers of my boyhood.But did you see this outfit Craig Revel Horwood sported on Halloween ROBBIE WILLIAMS, , has challenged Liam Gallagher, , to a boxing match.Really not recommended at their age.

Happily, though, most of us know that, these days, coercion and force in the bedroom are not only ­unromantic but unacceptable.The offending lyrics in the song, which is a duet, are uttered by the female voice, which sings: “I simply must go, the answer is no” . . . only for the man she is singing to to hand her a drink — and for her to question what is in it. Obviously not good on any level. But this song was written in  .It was a hit during a time when sex was for marriage, and women weren’t actually allowed to express any active interest in men so had to feign modesty at all times. In the s and s, before the Pill was introduced, that dance of reluctance and “persuasion” was part of the courting process and the whole process of seduction was based on women pretending they weren’t interested only to be ­persuaded that they were.But look how dferent things are now.Also, let’s face it, when you get the magnying glass out, there are plenty of storylines from the past that don’t quite measure up to the standards of . Look at James Bond, who basically sexually assaults Honor Blackman’s ­character Pussy Galorein the movie Goldfinger.Or the song Every Breath You Take and the film Love Actually, both of which feature a stalker as the romantic lead. And when you think about it, Daniel Cleaver’s courting of Bridget Jones really just boils down to ­sexual harassment.There are countless other examples of “romantic” plots which are very dodgy indeed by current standards but, at the time, we all lapped them up. And don’t even get me started on the lyrics of rap songs that are being played today which routinely talk about killing and raping women. Now that is grim.But instead of allowing this song to exist as the relic from the past, soul singer John Legend and Kelly Clarkson have rewritten it. Their version now includes the lines, “What will my friends think If I have one more drink  ”.That is instead of “The neighbours might think,   Say what’s in this drink  .  Legend describes his version as having “a new-found sensitivity in the #MeToo era”. I’d put it a dferent way and say he is ­trying to re-write history.Last year a radio station in Ohio announced it would stop playing the original because of ­complaints from listeners saying the song, “didn’t have a place in modern music”. That’s fine. No one needs to play itpeople are offended by it. But the idea that we can airbrush the fact that it existed in the first place is ridiculous and I worry we are all in danger of trying too hard to be PC.The risk is we become so vanilla, so afraid of upsetting everyone with our view, that we stop speaking our mind, which is a form of societal repression. Yes, it’s good to stand up for what you believe in, but taking offence at the lyrics of a song more than  years old might not be the best cause to bat for.Everything has a context, andwe aren’t careful we will all be so worried about how “woke” we are that we will forget our own views and how to express them.PARENTS everywhere will be reassured to learn that even when you are a sporting hero your kids still think you are a bit of an embarrassment.Peter Crouch said in an interview yesterday that his daughter, Sophia, who is eight, initially asked him to stay outside when he dropped her off at summer camp – because the other kids were laughing about how tall he is .The thing is, as any parent will confirm,it wasn’t his height she would have found another reason that he had to stay outside, whether it be his shoes, coat or haircut.In fact, don’t worry Peter, as they get older they get embarrassed about you just for breathing.MILLIONS of motorists use their mobile phones while they drive. Thirty-five per cent of drivers under the age of , and  per cent of all drivers, admitted to taking their eyes off the road to check texts, email or social media, an RAC survey reports.But the current law means reckless drivers can only be prosecutedthey are caught using hand-held phones to call or text. Meanwhile, those who take photos or scroll through music playlists are exempt from punishment.So police have struggled to enforce the law because they are often unable to prove exactly what drivers are using their phones for. Bear in mind thata driver looks at their phone for just two seconds while travelling at mph, they will cover ft blind, drastically increasing their chance of an accident.So I’m fully behind plans for a ban on even touching a mobile phone while driving, which were announced – drivers take note – on Friday. It is thought the ban could be in place by spring next year.Drivers caught holding phones to browse social media, or even input a sat-nav location, now face six points and a fine of up to £. But how anyone can be complacent enough to check Insta while in charge of a moving metal box that can kill people is beyond me.I have not driven for ten years – I walk or get the Tube – but my kids do and it really bothers methey even so much as glance at their phones. There is no doubt that it is distracting – and dangerous for the driver, but also to others. So this proposed new law is nothing but a good thing as far as I’m concerned.I’VE never been one to embrace dressing up for Halloween or any other kind of forced fun.Sorryyou think that makes me sound like a killjoy, but one thing I have noticed with each passing year is the sexualising of Halloween going off the scales.Forget wizards, goblins and ghouls – every celebrity event seems to be populated only with sexy vampires, sexy ghosts and sexy witches.

Nobody can be sure how this Battle for Britain will pan out, any more than in .Tory election manager Isaac Levido told staff this week: “There is a steep and narrow path to victory.”Another aide says: “It is unknowable. This is fraught with danger.”Polls are all over the place, some showing an easily blown Tory lead of six per cent — less than Theresa May’s before she lost her majority.Momentum Labour has made a flying start with social media, bombarding targeted voters with eye-catching and wildly misleading messages — just as it did so successfully in .“You would think the Tory machine might have learned from that debacle, but they haven’t,” says an insider. “And you can’t build a new system overnight from scratch.”The challenge for the Tories is to define the battle lines within the first two weeks.“If it is a choice between Boris and Brexit or a second referendum — or even a third referendum — we are in a good place,” says an insider.But with five parties in this fight — the Tories, Labour, Lib Dems, Brexit Party and SNP — lines rapidly blur.Tory rebels such as Phil Hammond can also wreak havoc by standing as independents.Even Boris’s own ,-majority Uxbridge marginal is under threat from a bizarre invasion of Extinction Rebellion and Stop HS protesters.Nigel Farage, stung by Boris’s successful EU deal, has stunningly over-reached, threatening to field  Brexit Party candidates — although he won’t risk standing himself.His wrecking ball move has backfired among old allies including Leave campaign partner Arron Banks and one-time Ukip MP Douglas Carswell.His own party chiefs are in revolt, with Farage under pressure to back down fast.Cash donors have begun deserting and pro-Brexiteers are voting with their feet.One Sun reader, Brian Pearsall — a “paid-up Brexit Party supporter” — tells me: “I will be backing Boris. Mr Farage is beginning to annoy me. If he wants us to get out he should put candidates only in seats where the Tories have no chance of winning. What the hell’s got into him ”Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has also misjudged the national mood by junking Brexit altogether — and campaigning to rejoin the EU.Her party has slipped in the polls and she is offering pacts to a ragbag of Greens, Plaid Cymru and any other minority group who might offer a hand.Yet every vote picked up by Swinson and Farage in Tory target marginals opens the door to a Labour advance.The stakes in this General Election have never been higher — or clearer. More than million adults voted in  to leave the European Union.Unless they have changed their minds, this is their last chance of seeing that wish come true.No more ritual humiliation of humble MPs who incur his wrath or ministers who dare challenge his petty tyranny.Parliament will take a while to recover its ­dignity after a torrid ten-year political trauma.

It came as he and LBC radio host Nick Ferrari discussed the findings of a Grenfell inquiry report published last week. Rees Mogg made reference to the fire brigade’s stay put policy which the inquiry found could have cost lives by telling residents to remain inside the building. “The more one’s read over the weekend about the report and about the chances of people surviving,you just ignore what you’re told and leave you are so much safer,” he said. “And I thinkeither of us were in a fire, whatever the fire brigade said, we would leave the burning building. It just seems the common sense thing to do. And it is such a tragedy that that didn’t happen.”    Ahmed Chellat, , who lost five members of his family in the  tragedy, which killed  people, demanded an apology. He told the Mirror: “He has got to apologise. Who is going to challenge this man over saying this  “What common sense is he talking about  “People died on the stairs trying to leave, they couldn’t breathe. “People needed help and directions, they tried to open doors and there was smoke everywhere. What is hetalking about     “How is he coming to this insensitive conclusion  “He talks about the cladding and the infrastructure - that’s fair comment. “The firemen were not aware of how bad this fire was and what the building was made up of, the emergency callers weren’t aware, so people took instructions. “This is the reality of it - he wasn’t there.”  Yvette Williams, the chair of campaign group JusticeGrenfell, said: “This is an appalling statement to make but unsurprisingly symptomatic of Rees Mogg’s ilk. “His government failed to implement the recommendations from the Lakanall house inquiry - leaving the fire service and local authority with ‘stay put’ advice as a national policy and no full evacuation procedure. “Rees-Mogg has a privileged background, what is his experience of living in social housing  How many tower blocks has he lived in  “It was his government who destroyed the fire and safety regulations, it was a local authority run by his political party that cost cut and ignored residents’ concerns resulting in the Grenfell atrocity. “To suggest that those who followed ‘his’ party’s instructions were not using ‘common sense’ is an absolute insult.  “That he thinks that this issue is nothing to do with race or class, reveals all we need to know about the upper class, Etonian, Oxbridge ‘honourable member for the th Century’. “He should be ashamed of himself.” “He does not know anything about BAME and working class communities or their le experiences and this kind of statement is evidence of that.” Ferrari asked Rees Moggsuggestions the tragedy was in part caused by racism or “policies of class” were correct. Rees Mogg, the Leader of the Commons, said: “I don’t think so. “I think the tragedy came about because of the cladding, leading to the fire racing up the building, and then was compounded by the ‘Stay Put’ policy. “And it seems to me that that is the tragedy of it.

Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald accused billionaires of being allowed to “trash the climate” at the expense of the less well off. It came as a think tank report revealed that private jets pump out carbon emissions the equivalent of , cars each year.Labour would consult with the industry about the date to phase out fossil-fuel private planes - and support the expansion of electric aircraft.   Mr McDonald said: “Why is the Government enabling billionaires to trash the climate when it’s the rest of us who will suffer the consequences  “Climate targets cannot be met without curbing pollution from air travel, and a passenger on a private jet produces ten times the emissions of someone on a regular flight. This simply cannot be ignored. “In just a few years’ time it will be possible for these journeys to be made by electric aircraft – so long as government puts in place the right incentives. “Labour will examine these proposals closely and consult with industry on the introduction of a phase out date for the use of fossil fuel private jets.”    The Common Wealth report found that , flights between UK and EU airports were made using private jets in , representing  per cent of all UK air traffic. A further , trips were made to destinations outside Europe. A private flight from London to New York was equivalent to driving a typical UK car non-stop for four and a half years, it said.

It’s just you, him, and the bomb, and you chat to him so you can buy some time in which you hope someone will come along, call the police, do the decent thing. So you talk to the soldier. There are lots of things he could be angry about with the people currently sitting above you – electoral fraud, using the NHS as a weapon, Brexiters campaigning against Brexit, Remainers who canapost agree on remaining – but the thing he is livid about is the Armed Forces Covenant. Not the idea of it, which is to ensure military personnel suffer no disadvantage due to their service, and sometimes get preferential treatment because of it. Nor the way it was enshrined in law in  with much fanfare, and the then-Prime Minister promising to “treat people with the dignity they deserve”.    No, he’s angry about the fact that within a year of it being made law, Parliament pissed on it. He’s angry that war veterans like him were made redundant just days before they qualied for a pension, while politicians facing reform to their own pensions got a higher salary to make up for it. Heaposs angry that veterans already investigated and exonerated of war crimes face being investigated again, even when no fresh evidence has been produced, and despite official promises it would stop. And heaposs furious that the veterans who gave their lives and their health for Queen and country - and in some cases, that of their wives and children as well - are still being ignored. Survivors of Cold War radiation experiments have been told evidence of their genetic damage is inconclusive that they must prove an injury sustained  years ago and that, eventhey do, they might be asked to prove it a second time.    Heaposs angry that ex-forces people still face barriers in finding jobs, homes, and mental health support. A study last year showed , veterans had psychological problems, , were in prison, and another , had no permanent address. He knows that everyone suffered in the past decade of cuts to public services. But he points out that those who are more in need of them always suffer most, and that only half of veterans who need that help ever ask for it. Heaposs particularly angry about the current governmentaposs commitment to the covenant, and the debt of honour it represents. He remarks bitterly that theyaposve finally signed it,  years on, and all that means is that the Tory party is now eligible for an employer recognition award. Oh, and theyaposve updated the the website.    Heaposs angry at the state of military housing,  years after the government said selling it off was a grand idea. Heaposs furious at the way his family had to go on a council waiting list. At how,they rent privately, a grasping landlord will rack up the rent for a building unfit for human habitation while their benefit is slashed. At how politicians call people who have to live in those homes scroungers, and say they should be put down. Heaposs angry at a Defence Select Committee report which said the Ministry of Defence was immoral and incompetent, and at a minimum income requirement for immigrants which blocks Commonwealth soldiers settling in the country they shed blood for. He quotes the committee chairman, who said: Every year we take evidence on the implementation of the Armed Forces Covenant, and every year we report similar complaints. The Government is failing in its moral obligation towards those who serve or have served in our armed forces. Heaposs angry about his mates killed for want of proper equipment, at a private defence industry quite literally make a killing with state-funded trips to dictatorial regimes, and heaposs angry at mealy-mouthed letters from politicians thanking him for his service and telling him thereaposs nothing they can do. He says politicians stand with the armed forces when it suits them, but turn their backs when it costs.    As he talks you realise youaposre angry, too. Youaposre angry about a Parliament that stopped governing in the nationaposs interest, and spent  years arguing over a thing that could not be done, purely because theyaposd staked their careers on it. Youaposre angry about allies who behave like enemies, knighthoods for men who hit women, a vice-admiral who consorted with a paedophile rapist yet keeps his pension, and his rank. Youaposre angry that because the people who took it upon themselves to run the country are unable to do so, youaposve been asked to re-elect Islamophobes, anti-Semites, incompetents and rabble-rousers so they can have another go at cocking things up, on a starting salary of £, a year.    You donapost like politicians pitting you against your neighbours because of how they pray or the colour of their skin. Youaposre perplexed about schools that have to shut down one day a week, about a NHS winter crisis that lasts all year, about a minimum wage which isnapost enough to live on. You thought all that crap was supposed to be over, by now. You remember how you were promised electoral reform in  and it never materialised. You wonder about the worth of a system that tells the critically ill to get up and work. You wonder how disabled people can have a better le without the allowances they need to pay for independent living.You realise that many veterans are disabled. And they are given the same crappy treatment as everyone , and often have to fight harder to be compensated by the employer who put them in harmaposs way.    You think about at your local postmaster, corner shop owner, launderette, binman, cabbie, cleaner, nurse, teaching assistant, council operative and heaven knows who  and wonder how, precisely, we’ll manage without migrants, and whoaposll be coming up with the points-based system youaposre told is such a great idea. Perhaps you look at your own bloodline. Perhaps you look at the history books. Perhaps, in the words of those who talk of sedition, treachery and surrender, you hear the echoes of bad people from bad times. You think about the fact .million people who could vote last time didn’t bother. You remind yourself thereaposs more than a million people missing from the electoral register - who should be on it, could be on it, but donapost see the point. You stand there, feeling angry, and think about how  years ago a war veteran with  yearsapos fighting behind him, who worshipped the same God in a dferent way, who felt oppressed and angry about promises his rulers had made and broken, stood in the undercroft of the Houses of Parliament with  barrels of gunpowder, some coal and firewood, and matches in his pocket.    You think about how that veteran was seized and dragged before the king, how he and his fellow plotters were tortured with the rack and other instruments for  weeks to produce confessions, and how after a show trial they were taken to the yard outside Parliament so the politicians could watch as they were hung by the neck, cut down while still alive, castrated, disembowelled, and cut into pieces. Perhaps you know enough to remember that despite injuries so bad he could barely sign his own confession, Guy Fawkes was brave and quick enough to jump from the scaffold before the executioner could stop him, breaking his own neck and saving himself the extra agonies the state wanted to inflict. You wonder why we still celebrate the capture, torture and death of that man with a bonfire and fireworks, why we have forgotten that it was once laid down in law we had to do so whether we agreed or not, and that for centuries his desperation was used to persecute others who shared his faith.    You wonder how we all forgot why he was so angry, or that after he was gone the oppression for people like him simply got worse, and lasted for more than  years. You remind yourself we live in a country where Catholics were banned from marrying senior Royals until , all because Henry VIII took against them. Perhaps youaposd also wonder what the authorities would do to that Afghanistan veteranhe was caught red-handed with his bomb under Parliament, and how it would compare to what they would dohe was Muslim. You look over your shoulder at the door, and youaposre glad no-oneaposs come along yet. Maybe you wish him luck, and tell him that as Fawkes said on the rack a desperate disease requires a dangerous remedy. First photos of how temporary House of Commons will look in £BILLION refurb   Maybe you will try to talk him out of it, or go to find a policeman in the hope heaposll get help and the people who put themselves above will finally listen to those left below. Perhaps youaposre prepared to be optimistic about his chances of getting the help he was promised, and that he needs. Me  I think Iaposd quietly turn around, close the door, stick my elbow in the fire alarm and then let him get on with it.

Sir Lindsay, knighted in  for for parliamentary and political services, prompted raised eyebrows recently, when he posted a bizarre picture of himself watching the Rugby World Cup final in which he was facing away from the TV, beside a distant cup of tea no human could reach.    The Lancashire-born businessman went to private Lordaposs College in Bolton and ran his own screen-printing firm before becoming an MP in . He has been a Deputy Speaker for nine years where his no-nonsense manner led to clashes with MPs - including telling off the SNP for singing EU anthem Ode to Joy in . In the same week he had a fierce clash with ex-SNP leader Alex Salmond, with the pair shouting at each other across the chamber over time slots given to Brexit scrutiny. Despite this Mr Hoyle is generally regarded as a popular figure who hasnapost made enemies in the same way as Bercow. And he’s been widely complimented for his approach to handling Budget debates, which has been part of his job as Chairman of Ways and Means. He was in the Speaker’s chair at the time of the Westminster Terror Attack of  March  - and the subsequent lockdown of the Houses of Parliament.    There was an outpouring of tributes in  when his -year-old daughter Natalie was found dead. An inquest recorded an open verdict, but heard she was involved in a “toxic” relationship before her death. Speaking in the Commons last year, her MP John Whittingdale said: At the end of last year my constituent Natalie Lewis-Hoyle, the daughter of Councillor Miriam Lewis and our right honourable friend the member for Chorley took her own le having been in a coercive relationship and suffered mental abuse in what is known as gaslighting. He called for more awareness of this kind of abuse in which a perpetrator tries to sow seeds of doubt in their victim so they begin to doubt their own sanity. And he asked then-Prime Minister Theresa May to support ‘Chat with Nat’, a charity set up by Natalieaposs mum to help other victims who feel they have no where to turn.

She had almost turned back on her way up the drive because the big house meant her nightmare was now reality. “It was a place people go to die,” explains Helen. “And my -year-old husband was moving in. I had to face what I’d been blocking out for months and admit ‘My Dan is dying’.” Helen, mum to nine-month-old George, had arrived at a hospice – Sue Ryder Leckhampton Court, in Cheltenham, Glos, and  days later her husband of  months died there from a brain tumour. But the care Dan and his family received transformed -year-old Helen’s views about death and is helping her grieve.    “They took the fear away,” she says. “They allowed me to be Dan’s we again, not his carer, so we could live those last days together.” Now Helen is backing a campaign to get us all talking about death. In  a Dying Matters campaign aimed to break this last great societal taboo. But research by charity Sue Ryder shows that, more than a decade on, we are still dodging the issue and denying ourselves “a good death”. They found % of people have not discussed their death with relatives, % haven’t written a will and fewer than % have planned their funeral.  Yet % of us know who we want to spend our final hours with and % have considered where, with most wanting to die at home or in a hospice. But % have no idea they can write that in an Advance Care Plan. Heidi Travis, Sue Ryder CEO, said: “We all need to start talking about the D-word. Deciding in advance how we want to die and having a conversation with loved ones will help ease and demysty the process.”    I spent a week at the hospice, one of seven run by the charity, and met with staff, patients, families and volunteers. Three-quarters of patients have cancer and others have degenerative or neurological conditions. And expert palliative care means half willhome after a first stay with their symptoms eased. Yet consultant Dr Paul Perkins, , explains: “There is still the stigma that this is where people come to die – and death is a taboo. We live longer and die in hospitals, not at home, so everyone is less aware of death – and it scares us.Our job is to make it as good as it can be by easing the physical process of dying. “We can’t ease the fear of leaving loved ones behind but we can help patients see that they’ve lived well. “And then, when that person is in their last hours – comfortable, warm, knowing that they are loved – we can look after the people holding their hands “That’s what hospices are about – loving people.”  I feel that sense of tranquillity and compassion while touring the wards with Head of Clinical Services, Debbie Williams, , who is a former oncology nurse. “I’ve been privileged to see many people die beautully here,” she says. “When patients first arrive they’re scared they will be writhing in agony when they die. We explain that they’ll start to sleep more, then be in and out of consciousness and gradually their breathing will slow and their body will shut down. Then they’ll die. “I don’t use euphemisms like ‘passing’ or ‘slipping away’. It’s important to be honest.” She goes on: “Of course it’s sad and sometimes I have a cry on the way home. “My mum died suddenly five years ago, just weeks after being diagnosed with cancer and after that I talked to my dad about his wishes. “My husband’s a paramedic and we talk to our kids, who are  and , about dying and where we’d like our ashes scattered. It doesn’t have to be a big issue. “You can do it in a casual way when something comes up on telly. But talking about death removes the stigma and helps us live our best lives.”    During my visit several patients are very close to death and the emotion of their families is palpable. They sit with their loved ones, popping out for a quick break in the family lounge. Volunteers are on hand to chat to patients and relatives. One volunteer, Pat Howard, , says: “I wanted to give something back after Mum died here in . We’re trained to handle dficult conversations but it’s about listening and empathising. “A young mum once asked me ‘How do I tell my son I am gong to die ’ “I arranged for our family support team to talk to her but also said ‘When my father died we’d look for the brightest star in the night and say That’s Dad’. She found that a help because her little boy had bought her a star for Mother’s Day.” Patient JJ, , has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which ­worsened when she got flu and pneumonia. Husband Bob, , was spending every day at her bedside.    “She had antibiotics in hospital but they didn’t work and she was transferred here for a bit of extra care,” he says. “The staff are amazing,” smiles JJ beneath her oxygen mask. “Nothing’s too much trouble. You are a person, not a number. And I’m as comfortable as I can be.” Then I meet “S”, who has advanced oesophageal cancer. The disease has affected her vocal cords so she talks in a whisper. “I can’t swallow properly so I don’t want to eat,” she says. “But they always find something I can fancy – yesterday I had the ice cream from the middle of an Arctic Roll. Lovely.” She squeezes my hand. “I can’t change things,” she says, “but I have asked for Holy Communion because I think I’ll find it a comfort.” S died a few days later. Chaplain Rob Pestell, , is the least “churchy” man you could meet. He explains: “Some patients see the dog collar and say ‘Sorry, I’m not very religious’, I respond ‘That’s good, neither am I!’ “I get to know what makes them tick – and I say ‘That is your spirituality’. Most patients have accepted they are dying but some say ‘I’m a hopeless case’. I try to help them see the value of their le.”    Kath Keogh, , teaches hospice staff to talk to patients about death. “We can all do it better,” she says. “We have birth plans but don’t say how we want to die. Death is seen as a failure, not a natural part of le.” Hospice catering assistant Claire Pemberton-James, , says her job is a privilege. She meets all the patients as she tours wards taking meal orders. “Many don’t want anything,” she says. “ButI give someone four peas and half a fish finger and they enjoy it it’s the best feeling in the world. “You really get to know them through chatting every day or sitting holding their hands.” Claire was so inspired by her work that she wrote a moving song called The House on the Hill “...where love resides and the weary can rest”. It was performed at the annual Lights of Love service and a video features on the website. Receptionist Mandy Edwards, , is the first person frightened relatives meet when they arrive. She started working at the hospice after her father died there in . Six years ago her husband Bob, , died there too. “His death confirmed everything that is wonderful about this place – the peace and support,” she says. “Not one person walks through that door willingly the first time. “So I’m here to say ‘You’re here now – we are going to look after you’.”    Helen Hopkins felt that emp­athy when she arrived to book her husband Dan into the hospice last July. He worked for a bank and she was a hospital administrator when they met in . But four years later Dan got an itchy mole on his back, checked – and was told he had malignant melanoma. Three years later it had spread to his brain. “Dan never wanted to know how long he’d got,” she says. “So we never talked about him dying. “Then last June he got much worse. One night he didn’t recognise me and I started to realise he wasn’t going to get better. But when they mentioned the hospice I was terried. “When Dan arrived in his room he was very sick and a load of nurses came and took over. That’s when I realised I was just his we again. “I was terried of being a widow on my own with a nine-month-old baby. “But the process of Dan’s dying was dealt with and I could talk about it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"hero dog who went grenfell","story":"NewsHero dog who went into Grenfell Tower to investigate blaze dies aged The cocker spaniel, named Murphy, was a fire investigation dog for the London Fire Brigade between  and ShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  NOV NewsFire dog Murphy was deployed following the Grenfell Tower fire \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Tragic Evha Jannath, , died when she fell from the Splash Canyon ride during a trip to Drayton Manor in Staffordshire. She had been allowed to go on a raft with four primary-age classmates without a teacher when the tragedy happened in May . CCTV footage showed Evha standing up in the six-seater vessel and being thrown into the water moments from the end of the ride. She survived the fall and began wading through thigh-deep water towards a “travelator” carrying the raft to the exit.    But Evha then suddenly disappeared from view and was found by park staff lying face-down in a ft-deep pool next to the ride. Stafford County Hall was told she was airlted to Birmingham Children’s Hospital but died later the same day. Evha and her classmates had obeyed the rules to remain seated during an earlier turn on the ride while accompanied by a teacher. But jurors were told several of the girls flouted the rules on the second trip - when there were no adults in the raft. The inquest was told the youngsters, from the private Jame’ah Girls Academy in Leicester, wanted to see who could “get the wettest”. Giving evidence Det Insp John Quilty, of Staffordshire Police, said Evha did not sit on a seat at any point on the ride. “They were reaching out of the vessel, putting their hands in the water during the ride,” he said. “One girl said they were talking about who could get the wettest. They were having fun but sadly we now know the consequences of this.”  The inquest heard she stood up at the “worst possible moment” and fell head-first into the water as her classmates screamed in horror. Jurors were told the youngster, who was wearing a white headscarf and hooded jacket, could not swim. One of Evha’s classmates who was on the boat told police: “Evha was not sitting on the seat. She was on the step and fell off. “She was in the water, holding something. We told her to get on another boat but she could not. “We asked the other boatsthey had seen our Evha but they had not.” Another child on the boat said: “When we were near the end a big tide came and Evha fell in. “We told her to climb in a boat but we think she could not hear us.” A third girl said: “The others were talking about how badly they wanted to get wet. They were running about, trying to get wet. “I pointed out there were signs saying we needed to stay seated. “I checked my bag to seeit was wet. When I looked up Evha was not there. She was in the water.”  The group alerted a woman stood watching the ride, who spoke with Evha - describing her as “seemingly uninjured and calm”. Evha’s friends then told ride operators what had happened when their raft ed to the ride entrance. Jurors were told it took  minutes from the alarm being raised to the “leless” youngster being rescued from the water. Park staff performed CPR on Evha and used a defibrillator before paramedics arrived on scene. A post mortem revealed she suffered multiple fractured ribs and a broken pelvis before her death. The cause of death was initially recorded as blunt force trauma to the chest before being revised to drowning. Evha turned  just five days before the tragedy and had gone on the trip as a reward for her good behaviour at school. The inquest was told Jame’ah Girls Academy bosses carried out a risk assessment before the visit to the theme park. They agreed that a teacher would each be “allocated” five or six primary-age pupils. But the assessment only said they should be supervised “on rides or to and from rides.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man branded hero climbing shard","story":"NewsMan branded hero for climbing The Shard to appeal six month prison sentenceEXCLUSIVE: The family of daredevil George King-Thompson are hoping to get him released from jail after he was caged for breaching a High Court injuctionShareCommentsByBrendan McFadden:,  NOV NewsGeorge climb the Shard in July without ropes \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Daredevil George King-Thompson climbed the -metre building from the ground floor to near the very top in just  minutes on July . He was sentenced to six months in Pentonville Prison, a Category B adult jail, on October  after breaching a High Court injunction against people climbing the -metre building. Now his family are considering launching an appeal against his sentence and his manager has branded his actions heroic. His brother has also set up a petition to support their campaign which has received almost , signatures. His mum Hilary King-Thompson, , said: It isnapost right that somebody like George is locked up. He doesnapost have a criminal record. He is locked up in his cell for -hours a day. This is a civil offence yet he is put in prison with criminals. He has to watch his back all the time.    We are a very small family, we are absolutely shocked,  this is the wrong sentence. Despite being locked up, Mrs King-Thompson said her son, who is also a personal trainer, is keeping a positive outlook and is still training in jail. He has a little routine in his cell, he does sit ups and has books to read. And although she admits she worries that George, who has ADHD, may come to harm from his daring climbing feats, she thinks he is inspiring others. She said: Obviously I donapost want him  to die, he is is putting out a message — aposfollow your passionapos. If I said do not climb The Shard nothing would have stopped him from doing it. Nothing I can say or do will stop him from climbing. He is the most positive person you will ever meet, he can inspire so many people.    After Georgeaposs climb, London Bridge Station was briefly closed and he received a police caution after he was spotted on the side of the skyscraper at around am on July . Teighmore Limited - the owners of The Shard - brought legal proceedings against him for breaching an injunction designed to deter trespassers, which was made by the High Court last year. The court heard in the months leading up to the climb George made  scouting missions to the building. The climber was criticised by Mr Justice Murray who said he aposdeliberately and knowing breached the order because he would have walked past at least  copies of the order during his climb. George is managed by Bryan Yeubrey, who also manages French climber Alain Robert, , who is known for scaling skyscrapers across the world. Mr Robert has a huge following and a bronze statue has been built in his honour in China. Mr Yeubrey said he believes George is aposheroicapos and aposinspiringapos for climbing the building.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLast week I noticed something curious. My Facebook feed was suddenly becoming cluttered with mummy and baby advertisements. Out of nowehere, I was being targeted with sponsored posts for everything from pregnancy health vitamins, to baby clothing and children’s books. It was bizarre because I have no children — and not that it’s anyone’s business — but I don’t plan on it anytime soon. It didn’t bother me at first—I found it curious and even a little bit funny considering I am not at a stage of le where I’m remotely interested in reading about babies, let alone Googling them. But I was not concerned enough to investigate further, or to flag up the ad as unwanted content. Mostly that’s because at first, I reasoned that it was only fair from Facebook’s mysterious algorithms that I — a -year-old woman in my childbearing prime from advertisersapos point-of-view — might be interested in baby content.    The wall-to-wall baby spam was irritating but amusing — a bit like an overbearing relative asking me when I’m going to hurry up and get married.  I mentioned it in passing to a few friends - and initially chalked up the phenomenon to my age, and maybe because I frequently ‘like posts’ from friends with babies across my social media profiles. But yesterday I made a discovery that transformed the experience from odd, to downright creepy. It became clear Facebook actually thought I was pregnant. And I think I know why.    aposBig Motherapos is always watching Like many women, I use a period tracking app to chart my monthly cycle. Yesterday, I opened the app to make an update, only to find an alert flashing at me. It was informing me that my period was very, very ‘late’. In fact, it wasn’t late at all. I had simply forgotten to log last month’s cycle properly, and, because I have notications for that app turned off, I hadn’t noticed when I didn’t complete the entry. But the app had certainly noticed. I corrected my cycle, and almost instantly the baby ads just stopped. It was then I began to feel uneasy as my mind made the connection between my period tracking app believing I had missed a cycle ten days ago, and my Facebook account that was suddenly trying to sell me pregnancy paraphernalia within days of my period appearing to be ‘late’. I have used this particular app for so long I don’t even remember when I downloaded it, or why I chose that particular brand.    So I pulled up the app’s privacy settings and noticed that while it promised not to share details I ‘entered manually’ with its third-party partners, the terms and conditions’ language cleverly avoided ruling out sharing information about aggregated data - like patterns or trends. I have chosen not to name the app here - it is not a well-known one, and appears to have been made by a small developer. Unless I have smoking-gun proof that it was selling my data to Facebook advertisers, I am not willing to make the accusation and damage someone’s business - they may have meant well, and it is an app I had until now enjoyed and used loyally for years.    What’s more, I wasn’t sufficiently troubled by the bizarre ads when I was seeing them to check the ‘why am I seeing this’ option on Facebook, or even to screenshot them. This problem of proof is not just a quandary for journalists - but for any of us who are concerned enough to try to investigate how our personal data is collected and shared online. Tech companies have an incentive to use opaque language, and the process to work out which apps are communicating with which websites, how often and why can become a confusing process as a result.  What I experienced has come to be known as ‘surveillance capitalism.’ For lay people like me, big tech has long felt like a wizard behind a curtain — clever, capable of changing how we experience the world in wonderful and spectacular ways — but ultimately powerful without enough accountability. This experience has confirmed to me I know too little about how much my social media technology and apps know about me. In a world where advertising is no longer restricted to billboards and magazines, I don’t want it to become so intrusive it leaves me feeling unnerved.    How did we get to this point  Humans are naturally fascinated by our own health - many of us love to count our steps, track calories, record our fitness routines in ways that can help us improve our lives immensely. It is a no-brainer that developers and social media giants have worked out how to monetise that precious data, and I hadn’t lost any sleep over it- yet. In many ways, algorithms have made my le better, more convenient, and more efficient. Those clever little trend-snfers have connected me with my new favourite bands, learned my style and promoted dresses and shoes I’ve dutully then gone on to purchase. Algorithms have uncovered my guilty pleasure and push the juicy ‘agony aunt’ columns I love to read to the top of my news feeds. But algorithms are rather like the body’s bacteria - you might not be able to see or understand them - but you can be certain they are not always working for you. Yesterday, a sinister thought popped into my mind. In future, my social media tech is likely to know I’m pregnant before I do - and I find that deeply unsettling. You might have heard about how US retailer Target was able to figure out a teenage girl was pregnant before her father did. Many people who were disturbed by my story after it went viral on Twitter noted, darkly, the news that Google has acquired Fitbit. Any time a company gathers more of your data, you have to wonder how soon the information being collected now to sell things to you now be weaponised against you in future. Where does it end  It is clear the dystopia is already here. Insurers are already linking customers’ premiums to their diet and health tracking apps, rewarding those who lead a healthy lestyle and penalising those who don’t. The dark side of period tracking apps has been well covered by tech journalists.    Icky stories have emerged in recent years revealing some companies were secretly using period tracking calendars in an attempt to track the moods of their female employees. But most upsettingly, an overwhelming volume of responses I received from women who had experienced a similar phenomena on their social media revealed it was happening following pregnancy trauma. Multiple women revealed they were still being slammed with ‘happy baby’ advertisements on their social media feeds after miscarriage or stillbirth. This is inappropriate, disturbing, and is something that should be a priority for the human beings behind these algorithms to find a way to address. However they do it, surely it must be done without forcing grieving women to give up even more personal information in the process. Inevitably, I can imagine that this could lead to yet more sponsored posts hawking things for sale - like happy pills and self-help books. Chillingly, as several women who have had miscarriages have claimed to me - they received ads for infertility treatment immediately after their pregnant loss. For anyone trying to get pregnant and struggling, the cheerful baby ads must be a galling reminder of their situation, sandwiched callously between pictures of what your old high school friends had for lunch and viral dog videos. aposWhy donapost you just use a paper calendar apos Many people asked me - somewhat condescendingly from men who have zero experience in this field - ‘why donapost you just use a paper calendar to track your period’  Without revealing more information than I am willing to share with the world , these trackers can be le-changing. Many, many women in your le will not not lucky enough to have an easy, pain-free, cycle that runs like clockwork. For many of us, it will be a constant, monthly feature of our lives for the better part of three decades.    Many women I know track their periods for their clever in-app analysis s. The apps give you knowledge - and knowledge is power. Tracker apps can help us save time, money and prevent embarassment. Some women have irregular cycles, and some are struggling to get pregnant.  Some might have corresponding health problems that worsen throughout their cycle, their hormones might affect mental health disorders and medication, or they may be using a natural counting method because they can’t use hormonal contraception for health reasons.  On the convenience side - which is really no one ’s business but a women’s own - knowing their cycle patterns might affect anything from when and how they choose to have sex, to what colour clothing they wear on a due day. It might give them a warning to pack sanitary items in advance, rather than avoid an expensive late-night rush to a corner shop for a heavily marked-up box of tampons.  Some using these apps will be trying to get pregnant- many are also using the apps to avoid it. Knowing exactly what stage of your cycle you are at when you are most at risk of pregnancy is a great help to many heterosexual women, who are still largely lumped with the responsibility for contraception with all the costs to their health and wallet, and the trial and error that comes with it.    The way many of the apps are designed assume the user would be happy to get pregnant - they are often pink-themed, focused on analysing when you are ovulating, and flashing excitable messages when your period is late. It lead me to wonder how many of these apps meant for women are designed by men - a quick spot of research confirmed mine was.  If you donapost think that matters, author Caroline Criado Perez has recently written a book about how products designed by men - from ill-fitting spacesuits to car passenger seatbelts designed for men’s bodies - can actually end up excluding and even endangering women. We are the products for sale Since my tweets about my discovery went viral, I’ve been thinking about my next steps.  The solution doesn’t have to be for me to stop using a tool that has improved my le on a monthly basis. But this has been is a welcome wake-up call for me. I will be learning more about how to more carefully navigate technology that mines my personal data, and about how to investigate it as a journalist. My experience reveals the cynical side to these mysterious algorithms that meticulously analyse my online behaviour to construct a picture of my fears and desires - to then sell on to advertisers. When we hand over our data for free in exchange for a small online convenience, we become the product for sale. It is up to me to work out now what my boundaries are, and to decide the price of convenience. While I might like the algorithms now that direct me to nice dresses and new music now, I can’t help but wonder how that data could one day be used to shape my future. On that question, Charlie Brooker’s brilliant Black Mirror series is already giving me nightmares.

The convicted drugs mule, who was locked up for trying to smuggle £.m-worth of cocaine in her luggage, said the women would openly get together behind bars. She often didn’t know where to look but was barely acknowledged. The -year-old claims some of the female inmates were known as “chetos” and used for sex, but many of the other prisoners craving affection would also join in.    Writing in her new book, Youaposll Never See Daylight Again, she said: “When you’re sharing a bedroom with  other people any right of privacy is out the window. “You see each other shower, you see everyone peeing, what’s a bit of sex between you and your most intimate  mates  I have to admit to being surprised by a couple of the relationships. “The chetos signposted their sexuality. Any time they hooked up with one of the more feminine inmates I wasn’t surprised, except when they found each other.  “Others spent so much time showing me pictures of their children and husbands I had to do a double take when I saw them face down in someone ’s cleavage. When their bloke visited, they’d be all over him. But for those cold winter nights in between they had alternative sources of comfort. “And when they got down to it they were so passionate it was like the world was ending. I was transfixed by their intensity. I’d never seen anything like it.”  Michaella, from Northern Ireland, was  when she and pal Melissa Reid, from Scotland, were arrested in the airport at the capital city of Lima in . She was initially sentenced to more than six years behind bars, but served just over two years in the maximum security prison. She was released in March  and has since given birth to twin boys. Describing one sex act between two inmates, she said: I was chatting when I got a nudge from the girl on the other side of me. I turned around.

But extracts from a secret journal written by newspaper diarist Kenneth Rose, who mixed with the royal circles during his long career, give us more of an insight into what the Queen really thought of the Tory Prime Minister.In one of the entries, which he has published in the Daily Mail , he writes that she one told one of the members of the team that Thatcher stays too long and talks too much.His entry from September ,  reads: Jean Trumpington to dine. She relates how when she went to take her leave of the Queen as a Baroness-in-Waiting on being promoted to be Under-Secretary in the Department of Health and Social Security, the Queen said of the PM [Mrs Thatcher]: ‘She stays too long and talks too much. She has lived too long among men.’    Another entry from  years later also discusses their relationship. On June ,  he writes: To Headington for tea with [philosopher] Isaiah Berlin. We talk of relations between the Queen and her Prime Ministers. The Queen is careful never to reveal what she thinks of each, although it is generally known that she and Margaret Thatcher had sharp disagreements on the importance of the Commonwealth. Isaiah now has an important piece of evidence. Both the Queen and Thatcher came to a gala at Covent Garden, but sat in dferent parts of the house. In the interval, the Queen let it be known that she did not want to meet Mrs Thatcher — who was sent to an upper room for drinks, as was Isaiah. Thatcher then said she would like to say goodbye to the Queen, a request that was ignored.   In an entry the following year he claims that the Queenaposs meetings with Tony Blair were much longer than the ones she had with Thatcher.This is far from the first time details of their dficult relationship have been made public.Declassied files revealed in  claimed the Tory PM enraged the Queen by  defying Commonwealth leaders in a vote over apartheid .Files from the National Archives of Ireland show that Thatcher sparked international anger after refusing to back tighter sanctions against South Africa.    The move had been agreed by  leaders at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Vancouver, Canada, but Mrs Thatcher refused, thwarting efforts to end apartheid and enraging heads of state. An Irish diplomat based in London reported back to Dublin that it was widely regarded that the PM had “blundered badly” and “she well knows but cannot admit her mistake”.

But Jemima, a back-row forward, managed to pull through and incredibly was back playing rugby six months later. I remember this sad moment with my best friend, Evie, when one time I was weaned off le support but slipped back under , Jemima said.    “My family and Evie and her mum, Rachel, were there and as they were walking out I remember saying goodbye to Evie. “I was holding her hand and not wanting to let her go and my sister was there as well and everyone was really upset. “They told me that I asked themI would wake up again, which was the saddest bit for them.” The teenager was taken off le support on GCSE Results Day on August  last year after doctors feared sheaposd die.    It was first suggested the sepsis may have been caused by a bacterial infection she picked up while in South Africa on holiday earlier that summer but tests havenapost proven this. Now Jemima, Worcester Warriors and UK Sepsis Trust want to raise awareness of the disease. The young athlete said she first thought her symptoms were as a result of overdoing it in training. She said: “I had rugby few training a couple of days before I fell ill.  I thought Iaposd overdone it because it was my first time training was with Worcester Warriors so felt a bit tired. “I was due to meet my friends, but felt sick so I had a bath and put myself to bed. Thataposs where it really started. “Over the next few days, I just got progressively worse. I couldnapost move. If I go out of bed, I would just collapse. “I couldnapost make it to the toilet or to the bathroom so I was just in the bed feeling awful. “One night, it worsened. I was lying in my bed awake all night. I had a fan and water spray to cool me down. ■ Sepsis affects , people in the UK and kills , per year. That’s more than bowel, breast and prostate cancer and road accidents combined. ■ Sepsis is the body’s often deadly response to an infection. ■ Initially, it can look like flu or a chest infection, but it can swtly get serious. ■ Seek medical help urgentlyyou develop any one of the following… – are lethargic or dficult to wake – feel abnormally cold to touch – the skin looks mottled, bluish or pale – are breathing very fast – have a rash that does not fade when you press it – have a fit or convulsion   “I tried to get to mumaposs room but I collapsed and my parents said they heard a big thump. My mum came like running into my room wondering what was wrong. Worcester Warriors are holding a special fixture for Sepsis Awareness Day on December  at Sixways Stadium in the city. Jemimaaposs dad Andy, an international sports event manager, said: “One of the keys to being aware of sepsis is that it started like a cold. “Her mum just felt it was a cold and she was in bed and then it sort of got worse to be like the flu. “It went from just having a cold, fever and being a bit weak.

Oliver Harcourt, a spokesman for British Seniors Insurance, said: Our research shows that as a nation we continue to be overwhelmingly proud of being British, and of the great things that make us Brits. From food such as fish  chips and roast dinners, to historic landmarks or unpredictable weather, Britons love what makes them British.

More than half reckon other nationalities think weaposre a country obsessed with the weather, with two-fths saying other nations think we drink tea like tap water. And two in five admitted they ring true to stereotypes and have a stf upper lip.  With fish and chips topping the poll, half the nation agreed they would happily enjoy the British staple in the pouring rain with an equal percentage always up for an ice-cream whatever the weather.

And six in  will pack their favourite brand of teabag during a trip to ensure they get their daily dosage of breakfast tea - three a day to be precise.  Nine in  of those polled said they enjoy being British, with three in four describing themselves as patriotic.

Miley Smith was chased by two large dogs which burst out of a home after she knocked on the door before one sunk its teeth into her buttocks.The poor youngster needed surgery and antibiotics after the horric attack in Newbiggin-be-the-Sea, Northumberland, and is now recovering at home, Chronicle Live reports .Her mum Vicky Smith, , said: It was just total panic. She was screaming, she was shaking and she was crying. Mr Smith said Miley had been full of excitement when she set out to go trick-or-treating.   The mum-of-six said she decided to let the youngster join her -year-old sister Imogen and her friends for the Halloween tradition while she stayed at home with her youngest child, three-year-old Bradon.They were all so excited and off they went with their treat bags, she said. At the time I thought they would be safe just around the locals doors. But a short time later a neighbour, called Christopher Henderson, brought an hysterical Miley back to her familyaposs house and told Vicky she had been bitten by a dog. Christopher came running down shouting that she had been bitten by a dog, Mrs Smith explained. It was horrendous. I just lted her over the fence. He said he heard all the girls scream and the dogs were going mad. He said he had never heard anything like it. The children told Vicky they had knocked on the door of a nearby house, and as a woman inside handed out treats, two large dogs forced their way out causing the children to run away in fear. Vicky believes Miley tried to escape by climbing over a small gate, but at this point one dog bit her just above the buttocks.

Jessica Pool, , has three children, aged five, three and nine weeks. She started suffering from postnatal depression after her newest arrival. The young mum noticed her children had their own space in their bedrooms when they needed some quiet time and her partner Matthew had the shed, but she did not have any space for herself. Ms Pool then decided to convert the under stairs cupboard into her new space. She cleared out the coats, toys and cleaning kit and for just £ transformed it into a phone-free mum zone complete with reading nook, calming candles and mood lighting.    She said: The reason why I made it is purely to have this space for myself. I thought I needed somewhere for myself to recharge, recollect and just proceed to be mum in a normal routine. Itaposs somewhere that I can call my own. She added a lot of mums do not put themselves forward and do not do much for themselves. Ms Pool said her mum cave is a space without any cleaning products or dishes to wash, where she can relax.    In here I can just breathe, take five minutes and just think about me, she added. Jessica from Shrivenham, Oxfordshire, said: I decided to make it because it was just a dumping ground and I got fed up with sorting it out all the time. I thought it would be somewhere for the children to go but then I thought no - they have their bedrooms. Sometimes us mums need somewhere we can escape to and still be near the children to look after them.  Sometimes Iaposll go take myself away for five minutes to give myself some space. Children take themselves away when they need a break and this is somewhere I can go. You hear about man caves and toy rooms, but Iaposd never heard of a mum cave. I suffer from postnatal depression and I felt like I needed somewhere I could take myself without inflicting my mood on the children and then I can come out and be mummy again.  She added: I took all rubbish to the tip, spent two hours painting, and spent about £ on it - on paint and shelves, the rest of the stuff is from around the house. Itaposs improved my quality of le drastically, todayIaposve felt a bit annoyed Iaposll go in there. Iaposve explained to my children that itaposs my space. Iaposve told them they can go in there, but itaposs more for me than them.

These are just some of the distressing sights that have greeted visitors to zoos in Indonesia this year. Now animal rights groups say an astonishing % of these attractions should not be allowed to operate. Earlier this year a video of a distressed-looking skeletal sun bear was shared around the world. And there was widespread condemnation as pictures emerged of animals living in filthy conditions at another zoo.    These are among a string of controversies which have prompted calls for urgent reform to end the suffering. Marison Guciano, of the Indonesia Animal Welfare Society, told the South China Morning Post: “According to a search by wildle monitoring group the Scorpion Foundation in , around % of zoos in Indonesia are unfit for habitation. “I think the situation has not changed much now.” He said most zoos fail to meet five key criteria - keeping animals free from hunger and thirst, free from pain and injury, free from discomfort, free to behave as they would in the wild and free from stress.    In June shocking video of a sun bear at a zoo in Singkawang was shared more than , times on Twitter. The clip shows the skeletal animal stretching as tourists look on. In response the West Kalimantan Natural Resources Conservation Agency said it would monitor the bear. More shocking pictures taken at a mini zoo in Cilodong, West Java, show animals in tiny cages surrounded by litter, were met with horror.  A visitor wrote on Twitter: “The situation is very improper, and this is open to the public. Are there actions that can be done  Guys, what should we do about this ” Zoo bosses blamed tourists leaving behind litter, and pledged to clear the attraction up. Another video filmed in March at the Taman Safari Cisarua in West Java shows a trainer appear to lash out at a tiger to make the animal look at a camera while visitors pose behind it. In a letter to the countryaposs Minister of Environment and Forestry, after the clip emerged, activists wrote: We stand against wildle attractions for the sake of entertainment rather than education. These attractions are a form of animal abuse and exploitation. Animal trainers and showmen frequently engage in negative reinforcement, whipping and striking animals, forcing them to carry out unnatural tricks and demonstrating that the animals can only be aposcontrolledapos by pain and fear.

On  minutes, the Pars had another chance to draw level but Kyle Turner blasted over from  yards.However, it was former Par Clark who came back to haunt his old side three minutes later as the Terrors doubled their lead.After Ian Harkes was fouled on the edge of the box, Clark smashed home his first of the season with a curling right-footed free-kick from  yards out leaving Gill rooted to the spot.Paul McMullan nearly made it - on  minutes, sliding onto Smith#s low delivery at the front post, but Dunfermline managed to clear the danger.Three minutes after the restart Calum Butcher rled a full volley just over the bar from  yards after the ball broke kindly for the Englishman.Having only just ed from injury there was concern over Robson on  minutes when he went down in his own box but after receiving treatment he was OK to continue.On  minutes the Fers had their best chance of the match as Josh Edwards slid in former Terror Ryan Dow but Siegrist got down well to deny the attacker from close in.The home side bounced back, though, as Clark was denied a double by a well-timed Lee Ashcroft block in the box following Pawlett#s cutback.Second-half sub Nisbet threatened to claw one back for Stevie Crawford#s men but his volley into the ground bounced over on  minutes.On  minutes Dunfermline came even closer, this time Nisbet feeding Ryan who cracked a curling effort off the crossbar.United were able to close out the final moments, despite heavy pressure from the visitors, to snap a two-game losing streak and tighten their grip on top spot.With Ayr United losing to Dundee on Friday night and Inverness falling to Morton, the Terrors move three points clear at the Championship summit.Dundee United : SiegristSmith, Robson, Reynolds , Brown Butcher , Harkes McMullan, Pawlett , ClarkShankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Stanton, Watson.Dunfermline : GillComrie, Edwards, Martin , Ashcroft Paton, Cochrane , Turner , Dow Kiltie, Ryan.Subs not used: Scully , Beadling, Morrison, Coley.Ref: Steven Reid.Att: ,."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.42496449-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.42496449-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.42496449-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.42496449-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dundee utd legend paul sturrock praised in westminster","story":"Dundee United legend Paul Sturrock has been recognised in the House of Commons following his induction into the Scottish football Hall of Fame.As reported in The Courier, Lelong Arab and North East Fe MP Stephen Gethins placed an Early Day Motion at Westminster on Wednesday morning.The forward scored  goals in a one-club playing career with the Tangerines, winning two League Cups, a league title and reaching the European Cup semi-finals and Uefa Cup final.Sturrock was a member of two Scotland World Cup squads and later enjoyed success as a manager, leading St Johnstone to promotion and repeating the feat at Plymouth, Sheffield Wednesday and Swindon.Mr Gethins said:  “A generation of Dundee United fans like me grew up watching and admiring Paul Sturrock.

But I think we had more than enough chances to win the game comfortably.“Since then we have been a lot more clinical so we’re looking forward to tonight and we’re confident we will come away with three points.”Playing tonight also gives Dundee the chance to get a headstart on their rivals at the top end of the Championship table.Three points would put them above Inverness ahead of Caley Thistle’s home match with Dundee United and level with Ayr.With top and third playing each other it is a chance to make up some ground on at least one of them but onlythey can pick up the victory.Forster added: “It can be a good thing and a bad thing playing first, depending on which side of the fence you are looking from. For us, we are looking to go and win the game, get three points and try to put a bit of pressure on the other teams who are playing tomorrow.“We obviously had the game on Tuesday but we’ve recovered well and worked a bit on what we are planning to do on the pitch tonight through the week.“We are looking forward to it, we have a bit of momentum and we are looking to try to keep that going.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/medw-tele-sports-podcast-twa-teams-1-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street its a halloween special but there is nothing scary about city clubs form","story":"This week it#s a Halloween special as Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger, George Cran and Graeme Finnan discuss the recent upturn in fortunes for Dundee and Dundee United and take a look at all the latest results in the Scottish Premiership.Calum and George will be joined by former Dundee and Dundee United defender Lee Wilkie for next week#s Dundee derby special.Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about all things Dundee and United.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/5dc003e52bbf28.90845187.jpg ","title":"string of wins lifts dees bid for top flight","story":"Following their - win over Morton on Friday night, it appears the stars might finally be aligning for Dundee.It wasn’t their best display of the season, far from it, but for manager James McPake a third win on the spin shows where he wants to take the Dark Blues.That kind of sequence is something the Dee haven’t achieved since November   when Motherwell, Hamilton and Kilmarnock were seen off consecutively in the Premiership.And James will hope stringing together Championship wins like the ones over Ayr, Alloa and Morton more often will see themto the top-flight.Although that is the long-term aim for Dundee, in this run some short-term concerns have also been addressed, with monkeys shaken off backs in the process.The - success at Ayr represented Dundee’s first away win of the season and they went back-to-back for the first time in the Championship this term as they comfortably dispatched Alloa -.Those were, undoubtedly, big steps in the Dens men’s development under new boss James, with the victory against Morton no less important.With the late collapse to a - defeat against Partick Thistle in their last home match still fresh in the memory, when Cameron Salkeld quickly cancelled out Kane Hemmings’ opener at Dens on Friday night, there may have been some doubts over Dundee’s mentality to bounce back.However, they collectively quashed all those worries with an onslaught of attacking football which finally brought the winner through Jamie Ness  minutes from time.That it was Ness who struck made it all the more sweet, given his recent injury troubles, while it also piled pressure on promotion rivals Dundee United, Ayr and Inverness for their clashes the following day.United responded excellently, downing Caley Thistle - in the Highlands, with the Honest Men enjoying a superb - win over Partick and their former boss Ian McCall on Saturday.After the weekend’s action, the Dee now lie third in the table and are in a good position for the second Dundee derby of the campaign set to play out at Dens this coming Friday night.They will want to put the first edition of the fixture back in August behind them and look in a far stronger position to do so.That it will be a - sort of game again, on the form of both teams, is out of the question.League leaders United have maintained a fair pace since that impressive win at Tannadice and lie six points clear of their city rivals.And, although the gap between the two sides before the first match, just three games into the season, was four points, the Dee are a better team now and won’t submit so easily.There has been a sea change at Dundee since a - defeat down at Morton in September and that, in no small part, is down to the acquisition of Graham Dorrans.Since the -year-old former West Brom, Norwich and Rangers man made his debut off the bench in that clash, the Dark Blues have won four games out of their last six, a draw at Queen of the South and that disappointing late loss against Partick aside.He has been fantastic in that run, with others like Kane Hemmings, Paul McGowan and Declan McDaid also stepping up to the plate on a consistent basis.Contributions from all of the above led to a perfect three wins from three last week, however, unfortunately for the Dee, United have gone toe-to-toe with them.It seems, instead of waiting for the Terrors to slip, the Dark Blues will need to take matters into their own hands soonthey are to turn promise into promotion."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert! How is it that I had never even heard of that curious little bay. There it lay, calm and silvery, like a scene from a theatre. A striking and beautul spot.#In the modern era, many thousands of tourists visit Tarbert each year.

Around  resident berth holders and more than , visiting leisure craft during the sailing season add considerably to the numbers who arrive at Tarbert and appreciate the attractive surroundings.The present plans for the power line, however, as exhibited by SSEN, will present a view on entering the harbour despoiled by a line of monster pylons.The current proposal suggests that four or five of the -foot pylons will dominate the western skyline. The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s. Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness.

This was followed by Debussy#s Premiere Rhapsodie which was written as a test piece for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire this requires of the performer the full range of colour and technique which was deftly delivered. Finally we were given Poulenc#s last Sonata. In this, and many of his works, he was rebelling against the Impressionist style and was particularly reflected in the outer fast movements with often angular and zany writing.The second half of the programme started with the Saints-Saens#s Sonata # also his last work. Unlike Poulenc, here he was harping back to the th century#s more classical style style of composition.Their official programme ended with a highly-virtuosic rendition of Chausson#s Andante and Allegro, but we were also given a short and charming encore # one of Gerald Finzi#s three pieces for clarinet and piano.This was all chamber music of the highest quality Maximiliano#s musicality, technique, emotional expression and tonal range were exemplary as indeed were those of his accompanist, Scott. It was patently obvious from their opening bars that they had played many times together with the rapport between them a delight to witness.

It will include a new toilet, shower, laundry and kitchen building,  new camping pitches and  motor home pitches, most of which will have hook-ups.The total project will cost around £,. In addition to HIE’s contribution will be an award of £, from the Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fund, with the balance from IGHT.It is expected that the modern site will strengthen the local economy by an additional £, a year and that other businesses on Gigha will benefit from the increase in footfall and visitor spend.The Isle of Gigha camp and motorhome site is due to welcome its first visitors in autumn , after which it will be open throughout the year.Strategic planning to secure a strong, sustainable future for the Mount Stuart Trust and the Isle of Bute is at an advanced stage, with key decisions expected by spring .Speaking ahead of the next phase of community consultations, Colin Boag, managing director of Mount Stuart Trust, said: #We are working intensively with community groups, Argyll and Bute Council and the Scottish Land Commission to develop a range of initiatives to improve the rural and urban landscapes on the island of Bute and to unlock growth opportunities for the local economy.#There is a great sense of purpose and commitment from everyone involved. This is matched by a desire to make progress on a number of crucial projects. The trust will conclude a strategic review by the end of the year. In conducting this - year ‘look forward’, we have been well supported through discussions with iniduals and community bodies across the island.#As part of the overall review, we are creating a specic rural strategy focussed on building a sound, sustainable future for farming and forestry on the island. Following an initial consultation with key stakeholders in July, we are developing the rural strategy through a number of joint working groups. These are examining key priorities including dairy farming, rural training and skills, forestry development and the environment.#Our emerging rural strategy builds on work completed with Argyll and Bute Council to support their bid to the Scottish and UK governments for a multi-million-pound Rural Growth Deal. Working together with the council, Fyne Futures and the Bute Island Alliance, we drew up a proposal for investment of £million to pilot on Bute a new transformative rural development model for niche food and drink and primary island industries.The trust is also consulting with local communities about the proposals to release urban land for community projects. This important work is being conducted in line with the Scottish Land Commission’s protocol on community engagement.In August, Mount Stuart Trust, with Scottish Land Commission representatives, held an urban community workshop with key community organisations in Rothesay. Discussion centred on how potential community projects could utilise land in Rothesay, which is currently in either council or trust ownership.Colin Boag added: #Throughout the discussions with ious community representatives, a number of local groups have expressed interest to make use of some or all of the land on offer. We welcome their interest in creating opportunities for positive change on the Isle of Bute.#I am confident that the depth of collaboration between Argyll and Bute Council, the Land Commission, local communities and the trust is set bring a strong sense of renewal and confidence to the island.#It was a trip to the Co-op and trollies at the ready for Lochgilphead High School pupils, as they were set a mission in aid of the Argyll Foodbank.Staff from the school ided the group of S pupils into teams, giving each an inidual budget to stick to.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"skerryvore-set-christmas-selkirk","story":"SKERRYVORE are coming home to Scotland for Christmas.And they plan to get into the festive spirit with a party at Selkirks Victoria Halls.Skerryvorersquos ability to fuse traditional Scottish music and rhythms with a range of other genres is a trademark of their distinctive, high-energy sound.For more than a decade brothers, Danieland Martin Gillespie , their friends Fraser Westand Alec Dalglish , have been thrilling audiences all over the world.The addition of Craig Espie , Jodie Bremanesonand Alan Scobie onand their sound became even greater.With awards galore and sell-out tours all under their belt,  has been Skerryvorersquos busiest year to date, with performances in the USA, Canada, Australia, and all over Europe.But now they are ing to Scotland for the festive season.And to kick off the celebrations they will play the Victoria Halls on Saturday, December .Drummer Fraser West told us: \"Winter tour dates usually find the band at home in Scotland.\"It gives us the chance to spend the festive season with our families.ldquoSelkirkrsquos Victoria Halls is a new venue for us, and wersquod like to think it will be the first of a number of s to dferent Borders venues.The Skerryvore in Selkirk show starts at .pm.Tickets, priced at pound, are available from the Live Borders website."},{"url":null,"title":"focus-smallest-gallery-gala","story":"The Focus Centre in Galashiels is inviting visitors to what it claims is the smallest art gallery in Gala.It can be found in the foyer of the centre but, according to organisers, blink and you will miss it.The glass fronted wall cabinet was first used properly to house items and artefacts to coincide with Remembrance .But Mark Timmins, from Works Plus, and Tracey Alder, from Focus Crochet Group, put their heads together and discussed how the little cabinet could be used best in the centre.And so the Smallest Gallery in Gala got its name.Showcasing their handy work in the tiny gallery this month is the Crafty Dafties group run by Pat Johnston and Sylvia Knaggs who meet on a Wednesday at am till pm.They specialise in an array of crafting that includes quilting, sewing with all kinds of fabric, knitting and more.

There are many people walking around freely drinking during these times.ldquoThis makes it dficult to identy those young people who are underage drinking when there are such crowds.Another wrote: ldquoIntoxication in these areas is unpleasant to witness. In all cases we are entitled not to be subject to the loudness and antisocial behaviour this leads to.On the other hand, some respondents voiced their concerns about bringing in alcohol bylaws: ldquoI think itrsquos a complex situation which deserves time and thought. Irsquom not entirely sure that reacting in a retrospective way is the best approach.ldquoI feel there are many behaviours and traditions entrenched in Scottish and Borders society around drinking habits.ldquoI feel personally that there are alternatives for many people socially that do not centre around drinking or going to the pub, such as the cinema, concerts, sports, dining out, etc., but not everyone has the imagination or willingness to explore these as valid ways to enjoy yourself.Another objector wrote: ldquoDrinking in public places doesnrsquot cause a problem in itself. Issues arise when certain iniduals drink alcohol to excess in any setting.ldquoThe problem, in my view, wonrsquot be solved by a blanket ban on alcohol in public spaces. There are already laws to prevent antisocial behaviour but they need enforced.Police Scotland also provided a detailed response to the consultation. It reads: ldquoAlcohol bylaws are used within the three other local council areas within Lothian and Borders, namely East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian.ldquoBy having such bylaws in force it assists Police Scotland in reducing anti-social behaviour and violence both of which are known to have an association with drinking in public.ldquoCurrently the Scottish Borders area is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.NHS Borders, Borders Alcohol and Drug Partnership and Scottish Borders Children and Young Peoplersquos Leadership Group provided a joint response, which reads: ldquoAlcohol consumption can take place in our communitiesrsquo private space as well as within licensed premises.ldquoNot allowing people to drink in a public place will help to reduce the normalisation of alcohol being an ordinary commodity and builds communities and environments that supports a culture change and reduces exposure for our children and young people.ldquoPublic drinking can adversely affect the quality of le for residents and our communities.ldquoAlcohol Focus Scotland report that one in two Scots experience harm from anotherrsquos drinking and often this harm is experienced in public spaces .ldquoIn this study % had experienced harm to others in public places and this was mostlyexperienced by the younger age group .ldquoAlcohol bylaws can be used as an additional tool to reduce the nuisance and disorder normally associated with public drinking.ldquoLicensed premises are well regulated within the Scottish Borders and provide the opportunity to consume alcohol in a safe environment.ldquoThe Scottish Borders is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.Councillors will now be asked whether to conduct further consultation on two options: a blanket ban on public drinking to cover the whole of the Borders, or the introduction of an alcohol ban in certain areas of the Borders. Police Scotland has indicated it would prefer the first option, to ease the enforcement of the ban.Furthermore, councillors are asked to consider undertaking a pilot scheme in specic towns, which could then be used to gather further feedback from the public."},{"url":null,"title":"golden-granny-hilde-aims-fashion-success","story":"AN archery gold medal winning grandmother at the British Transplant Games is setting her sights on fashion.Hilde Paxton from Clovenfords, who had a liver transplant shortly after her th birthday, struck the bulls-eye at Newport earlier this year.And the -year-old is already preparing to defend her title next year by raising vital funds for her Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team.Hilde is hosting a fashion show on Saturday, November  in Galashiels.She told us: \"Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team has around  members from all over the east of Scotland who take part in the Transplant Games.\"An important part of being a member is helping to raise the funds required for sending members to the British Transplant Games.\"The Colours Fashion Team will take to the Focus Centre boardwalk on the Saturday for an evening of glamour and casual wear.Included in the pound ticket price is a complimentary glass of Prosecco on arrival.As well as the fashion show, there will also be a grand raffle and a licensed bar.Tickets for Hildes fashion show, which starts at .pm for pm, are available from the Salmon Inn and Focus Centre, Galashiels, the Bridge Inn and The Gt Shop, Peebles, or The Hub in Innerleithen."},{"url":null,"title":"top-up-tap-plans-galashiels","story":"GALASHIELS is set to become the first town in the Borders to receive an official top-up tap.Scottish Water has already installed the water stations in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Ayr, Oban and Fort William as part of its Your Water, Your Le initiative.As well as providing healthy drinking water, the refill taps will also reduce the number of plastic bottles which are currently in circulation.Scottish Water now want to install the top-up tap in Market Place -

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

The River Esk snakes around the edge of the course.Prof Crofts expressed concern that dogs could easily swallow them, resulting in ldquolarge vet bills for owners.After ing the balls to the club, he has issued a call for the flood protection scheme, currently being drawn up for Musselburgh, to include measures to slow down water coming off the Pentland and Moorfoot Hills where the North and South Esk rise.Prof Crofts, of Musselburghrsquos Eskside West, a geography expert who has worked as a research scientist in Scotland, said: ldquoAlong the golf course there are very soft banks and you can see where they have been cut back, and probably there was some rough at the end of the fairway where lots of people have lost balls.ldquoWe cannot stop leaves and tree trunks being brought down the river but the speed of rise of the water level and its velocity shows that any flood prevention scheme for Musselburgh needs to look hard at measures to slow down water coming off the hills and into the river. Without this, the erection of walls being proposed in Musselburgh will not be public money well spent.ldquoMany of us feel the importance of the amenity of this stretch of the river ndash it is very fine.He said a tree planting scheme using native species should be discussed with landowners in the headwaters of the Esk catchment area, as government grants were available for such work.He said: ldquoI am talking about hundreds of thousands of trees maybe. Careful hand planting of trees is best rather than using tractors to dig ditches to prepare the land for planting as this would aggravate the problem by increasing the rate of water running off the hills. The trees would take up water from the soil.ldquoThe use of the reservoirs on the North and South Esk and the temporary flooding of the flat land along the river should be seriously investigated to store water during heavy rainfall and therefore slow the release of water into the river.ldquoIf you look at the flood issue, itrsquos caused by the river rising very fast but itrsquos made worsethere are high spring tides and a storm surge in the North Sea, and also a northerly wind across the estuary which piles the water up high and stops the river water escaping for a couple of hours either side of high tide.Professor Crofts has raised his concerns with consultants who are drawing up the Musselburgh Flood Protection Scheme and he has also made local councillors aware of his views.As for the coast, he highlighted small sand dunes which formed a natural barrier with grasses, which, below the ground level, had yards of roots acting as a natural catcher of the sand.Jackie Lambert, captain of Musselburgh Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was unaware of the issue regarding golf balls being found on the beach near the mouth of the River Esk.ldquoWhilst, the figure of  golf balls is signicant, it is unknown over what timescale these balls have accumulated andthey are all, indeed, from the course.ldquoNotwithstanding this, the golf club will happily participate in any working group looking at the wider issues of flood protection and the environment in and around Musselburgh.

I have edited it for publication here, but I have attempted to keep the story as close to the original as possible, and the story itself is completely the idea of the children.IN PRESTONPANS, there lived two nine-year-old children called Max and Lily.One day, they went on a bike ride to Preston Tower for a picnic. When they got there they laid a chequered blanket down on the grass, opened their basket and began to eat.They were about to leave after eating their food when they saw a robin perched on a nearby branch. It seemed friendly and the children fed the wee bird some of their leftovers.The robin then flew to a nearby abandoned cottage. The children were intrigued and followed the robin to investigate the cottage.They couldnrsquot remember noticing it before and they were wandering around it peering inside through small a gap in the wall. They couldnrsquot see where the robin had gone. They should have just left it but curiosity got the better of them and they searched for a way in. They were anxious to find out what had happened to the robin.But there was no way in, as the entrance and windows were blocked. So they clambered up the cottage wall, the bricks crumbling under their feet.Tired and exhausted, they finally reached where they thought the robin had landed.They found an opening which led to a dark passage. Despite being a bit scared, Max and Lily decided to investigate and walked down the passage. It was dimly lit by small gaps in the wall that let in narrow beams of light. At the end, there was a staircase. They huddled together as they walked.Then all of a sudden, the floorboard behind them collapsed.Now in fear and panic, they dashed up the steps of the dilapidated staircase into the attic.From the corner of the attic, they could just make out a small black figure running towards them.They thought they had seen the robin but it was something much worse. ldquoMouse! screamed Lily. Then they heard a glass shatter ndash smash!They were now terried and they sat in pitch darkness. The only light they had was the light that was seeping through the bricks in the walls.As they sat in fear, they realised they needed to come up with a plan to escape. They searched the cottage for a way out.As Lily investigated around the room, she tripped over a rug that seemed to have something poking upwards. She called out for Max and he came rushing down the stairs.As Max kneeled down to take a closer look, Lily revealed what looked like a trapdoor.Astonished, the children pulled the handle.It led to a tunnel which was flooded with candlelight. Who lit the candles  Max and Lily wonderedwhoever had lit the candles knew they were there.They entered the candlelit tunnel and one step at a time they cautiously moved forward.Then, slam! The trapdoor shut behind them and they jumped in fear. This was all too much for them to handle, they were desperate to get out.Then Max heard a soft but evil whisper: ldquoPlease stay, Irsquom lonely.In terror, he pulled out his phone and pressed  but it instantly shut off. ldquoPlease stay, said the voice, now sounding child-like.ldquoHelp! screamed Max and Lily through the gaps in the wall, but help never came.Then they heard something on the floorboards above.ldquoThere must be something up there, said Lily. ldquoI guess the only way out is to follow the candlelight.So they ventured further down the candlelit passageway.As the pair made their way through the tunnel, they could just make out what looked like a white figure approaching, who had a terrying grin with sharp teeth.Max and Lilyrsquos hearts beat uncontrollably as they sprinted away from this terrying image and as they did so all the candles blew out, throwing the children into complete darkness.Was this thing still there  The friends sat together in the darkness breathing heavily, in shock and terror.Suddenly, in the darkness, icy fingers gripped Lilyrsquos arms.ldquoWas that you rsquorsquo asked Lily. ldquoNo, replied Max.All at once, the candles lit up again. Max and Lily turned round and saw a horrying face: ldquoArghhhhhhh!They woke in the sunlight. ldquoWhat  said Max, confused. ldquoWhat just happened   added Lily.ldquoIt must have been a bad dream, said Max. ldquoBut both of us had the same dream, how is that possible ldquoWe had better go, they said.As they were about to leave, they saw a robin.

This was inevitable as she had been travelling one hour each way to get to Dunbar and, even though subsidised by us to make the journey, a two-hour commute is simply not sustainable.Mr Bruneau warned of the impact of demands on private nurseries in April this year when his nursery in Haddington saw its grades fall in an inspection. He said: ldquoThis is a systematic problem which is causing a death spiral in the quality of nursery provision throughout the industry.The inspection report on Dunbarrsquos Pumpkin Patch rated its quality of care and support, staffing and management and leadership at twowith the environment rated a three .The report said that parents had contacted the inspectorate following its unannounced visit in August to discuss concerns.A high turnover in staff was raised by a number of parents, with one telling inspectors: ldquoOften when I drop my child off I have to introduce myself and my child to the agency staff.The report said: ldquoParents told us that they often did not know the staff when they dropped off their children in the morning, often resulting in their children being reluctant to attend.Mr Bruneau said that the introduction of mandatory SSSCregistration was creating recruitment problems throughout the industry.He said: ldquoBefore the advent of SSSC registration, our group of nurseries never used any agency staff as recruitment was simple. It included people of ying ages, experience and circumstance.ldquoIt was a healthy labour market now new staff are iniably under , inexperienced in le, work and certainly the care of children.ldquoNursery closures are inevitable as sites struggle to find staff, maintain standards and satisfy increased demand.He said his company had decided to rationalise itsservices, placing more experience in fewer sites, and called on the Scottish Government to reverse policies he said ruled out more mature staff from working in nurseries.He added that all five members of staff at Dunbar had been offered places at his other nurseries.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council, which used the Dunbar nursery as a partner provider, said: ldquoWe have worked with Pumpkin Patch as one of our partner providers, offering funded early learning and childcare for pre-school children for many years.ldquoOur officers have also provided extensive support to the Dunbar team to help them improve the quality of experiences following recent Care Inspectorate reports. Our assistance has been recognised and appreciated by the owners, who feel that we have done all we can to support them.ldquoWe acknowledge that this will have been a dficult decision for the owners and will have implications for their team at Dunbar. We also acknowledge the upset and disruption that the nursery closure will bring for parents using this service.ldquoOur staff will work with and support parents to find alternative early learning and childcare within the area that meets their needs.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoMore than , children are already benefiting from the expanded entitlement after we increased training opportunities and routes into the early learning and childcare sector, resulting in a record ,-strong workforce.ldquoWe are working alongside local authorities and providers to ensure the necessary workforce is in place ndash including running a national early learning and childcare recruitment campaign, increasing support for training places and modern apprenticeships, and enabling providers to advertise jobs free on the MyJobScotland website."},{"url":null,"title":"pensioner-completes-74-year-quest-discover-father","story":"David Simpson had spent  years looking for his dad after growing up in a Quarriers orphanage to the west of Glasgow before moving across the Atlantic.But his attempts proved fruitless until a visit to long-lost family in Elgin last year.John Hamilton, from Lost Haddington, then became aware of Mr Simpsonrsquos quest.He said: ldquoFrom the information David received from Quarriers, all he knew was that his father was a Jack Cunningham, a plasterer from Goodallrsquos Place in Haddington.ldquoHis niece AnnMarie Whyte did a search for Goodallrsquos Place and the result came back with a find against a Lost Haddington image for the old Goodallrsquos shop on the townrsquos Bridge Street this led to AnnMarie posting a question askingI knew who Jack Cunningham was.ldquoA search of the Lost Haddington collection for Cunningham brought back too many matches, so the search was honed to lsquoplastererrsquo and the results produced the equivalent of a Holy Grail image ndash a George Angus scan of a lsquoJohnrsquo Cunninghamrsquos security application to RAF East Fortune.As well as correcting the name, the image confirmed his occupation and address, as well as his height, hair and eye colour.A plea was put on social media for further information, which found that Johnrsquos nickname was lsquoGibbyrsquo and that David had a cousin living in Musselburgh called Janette Brotherstone.Mr Hamilton said: ldquoAlso, a further search of Lost Haddington for the word lsquoGibbyrsquo, with it being an unusual name, produced another George Angus image from  showing Davidrsquos father John when he was only five or six years old holding the date plate for his school photo ndash George had annotated the image saying the lsquoboy holding the date slate was Gibby Cunninghamrsquo, so when I sent David this image it was the first time hersquod seen his father.ldquoThe feedback from the Lost Haddington followers also indicated that John died in  when he lived at No  St Annrsquos Place.ldquoThrough the invaluable feedback which named Janette as his first cousin, David was put in touch with her and shersquos since sent him some old family photos showing his father throughout his le.ldquoThe photos came from Davidrsquos fatherrsquos home, where he died, as it was Janette who dealt with the death notices for both Davidrsquos father and Johnrsquos we Jessie Cagder.ldquoDavid visited Scotland in autumn  so I offered to bring him to Haddington, which he accepted.From there, David, who now lives in Rochester, New York, was able to see the home where his dad was born on Haddingtonrsquos St Martinrsquos Gate, as well as his homes on Goodallrsquos Place and St Annrsquos Place.It is thought Davidrsquos dad was lodged with a landlady while working in Elgin in .According to Mr Hamilton: ldquoThe landladyrsquos husband was away from home for two years as a soldier in World War Two and itrsquos during this period that John and the landlady must have had a moment of indiscretion together, which produced David!ldquoWhen the landladyrsquos husband ed home from the war due to injury and found his we holding baby David ndash that couldnrsquot have been his ndash he gave his we the ultimatum: lsquoTake him to the orphanage or itrsquos a orce.rsquoldquoAt the age of around one month old, David was taken to the Quarriers orphanage which is near the Bridge of Weir to the west of Glasgow.David left Quarriers at the age of  and eventually moved to Winnipeg in Canada in  before eventually settling in New York.More than  years ago, he began his bid to track down his family.

It was just a huge expansion of the site.ldquoBut at the actual site round the Clootie Well itself, we didnrsquot remove anything other than possibly inappropriate stuff such as umbrellas, sunglasses, a pair of trainers.ldquoThere was a colossal amount of stuff around that was totally inappropriate.However, Mr Stott said those involved were careful to show respect to people who had placed genuine offerings around the well.He added: ldquoItrsquos peoplersquos wishes, peoplersquos hopes, obviously, that they are hanging on these trees.ldquoWe did it with as much respect and dignity as we possibly could.He continued: ldquoThe idea basically is you hang up a wee bit of cloth, and as that cloth biodegrades it draws away the illness of the person who you have hung it up for.ldquoSo thatrsquos the theory,you like, or the history of it. But things like sunglasses are clearly never, ever going to biodegrade.He said those who initially expressed concerns over the clean-up were reassured once the purpose of it was made clear.And he suggested an annual drive to keep the surrounding area tidy could be in order in future.He added: ldquoI wouldnrsquot quite say we havenrsquot scratched the surface, but Irsquom quite sure the same exercise could be done again and it still wouldnrsquot actually affectthe character.ldquoI would like to see some kind of annual event ndash done tastefully, done as a family thing, just to make sure that we keep on top of the non-biodegradables and we donrsquot end up back in the same situation.Clootie wells ndash or sites drawing on similar traditions ndash can be found where in Scotland and the UK, but few possess the unsettling atmosphere found in Munlochy.Its strange power even inspired elements of Ian Rankinrsquos novel The Naming of the Dead.While it is associated with a holy well, such healing traditions pre-date Christianityand the area has become an important site for those with a iety of beliefs and none.Maree Morrison, of Forestry and Land Scotland, said  volunteers took part in the clean-up from the local communities of Munlochy, Avoch and Knockbain, as well as from further across the Black Isle and Easter Ross.She said: ldquoThe site was expanding rapidly, with the surrounding woodland being badly affected by non-biodegradable items as they built up over the years.ldquoThere were cloots tied around trees and information posts in the car park.ldquoThe items had crept out from the well up to  metres out into the woodland, and the local community felt that it was getting too much and was detracting from the traditional nature of the healing well.Ms Morrison said volunteers removed a iety of unsuitable items including empty dog poo bags, entire pairs of jeans, a window blind and even an electrical sander.Forestry and Land Scotland is now requesting that any offerings left at the site are restricted to natural cotton or wool. Any plastics, polyesters or other materials will be removed."},{"url":null,"title":"If Labour win  it  39 ll be less like Venezuela than Britain circa 1974","story":"Jeremy Corbyn was also talking tough this week. He identied some of the capitalist criminals Labour is coming for, including Sir Jim Ratclfe of Ineos. Though itrsquos not clear under what law the polluting plutocrats could be prosecuted.So, is this class war in the UK  Are we on the road to Venezuela  Whatever the polls say, a Labour victory this Christmas is quite possible with Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party now splitting the Tory vote. There is a powerful mood for change in Britain. But what would a Labour government actually look like We have never had such an avowedly radical Prime Minister ndash not even in , when Labour was led by a small ldquoc conservative, Clement Attlee. However, Labour reality would be rather dferent from the rhetoric. Burrow into Labourrsquos policies, and what emerges looks more like reheated social democracy, circa, than a Bolshevik revolution.For a start, we can largely ignore the issue that ided the party so bitterly in recent times: nuclear weapons. Jeremy Corbyn may be a lelong member of CND, but Labour is no longer a unilateralist party. Its  manesto committed a Labour government to renewing Trident almost indefinitely.But Corbyn will still enter Number  with a raft of left-wing policies, from seizing corporate assets to abolishing private schools as well as taxing the rich until the pips squeak. However, many of the headline policies will never make it to first reading, let alone the statute book.Abolishing schools like Eton would involve y court action, not least from faith schools and the home school movement, who might also be affected. Labour is more likely to confine its assault on educational privilege to axeing tax reliefs worth about pound. billionSimilarly, seizing % of the shares of companies with more than  employees would be fiercely resisted in the courts by shareholders. They have deep pockets. I suspect Labour would confine itself to increasing corporate taxes, ending zero-hours contracts and restoring trades union rights ndash all of which are eminently doable.Indeed, looking behind the radical rhetoric, much of Labourrsquos policy agenda is surprisingly modest, viewed from Scotland. Measures like free personal care, abolishing university tuition fees, childcare for three and four-year-olds, scrapping the right to buy, lting the benefits cap and the bedroom tax ndash these are all achievable.Indeed, the Scottish Parliament has already achieved them, bar the welfare cap. Nicola Sturgeon will no doubt remind the Labour leader of this repeatedly in coming weeks.Nationalisation is a policy that used to be seen as ldquoloony left but is no longer. Taking rail into public ownership shouldnrsquot be too much of a problem, since Network Rail, which owns the track and signalling, is already in public hands. The service franchises could be replaced as they come up for renewal, without needing to hand billions in compensation to Virgin and the rest.Waterand energy would pose greater problems, not least because most of our energy companies are foreign-owned ndash often, ironically, by state-owned bodies. But with a good wind it should be possible for Labour to find a way. Public attitudes to public ownership of utilities have changed out of all recognition since the s.Similarly, there is broad public support for Labourrsquos Green New Deal. A majority of voters agrees there is a climate emergency. Though they may not agree with the measures needed to tackle it.Labour is not going the full Extinction Rebellion route of making Britain zero carbon by . But its own policy, passed at conference, is still pretty radical. It commits a Labour government to making Britain zero carbon by . Thatrsquos only five years longer.We are talking about the most radical change to our lestyles since the industrial revolution. Labourrsquos policy would mean decarbonising transport, home heating and agriculture in a decade. Millions of cars would have to be scrapped along with millions of home boilers. Air travel would all but cease.Labour promises a huge investment in renewable industries to compensate, but that is unlikely to replace the jobs lost in the car industry, oil and gas, road haulage and retail.So expect the Green New Deal to become somewhat lighter green in government. There is likely to be a rt between the Thunberg-supporting ldquode-growthers and Labour MPs, who traditionally see economic growth as the best way to address poverty and inequality.However, Britain already has a rather good record on eliminating greenhouse emissions, and this will continue, albeit with the  target reduced to % net zero.In sum, Labour offers a practical social democratic programme which could be very attractive to voters, especially younger ones. However there is one very big problem: Brexit.Labour is committed to negotiating a new Withdrawal Deal to replace Boris Johnsonrsquosand to putting this to another Brexit referendum. This will consume a vast amount of political capital and will surely dominate the first year of a Labour government.Corbyn wants to reintroduce the customs union and Brussels would probably agree to that. But Labour also wants close regulatory alignment with the European Single Market, which the EU  would probably reject. If Britain wants to be in the single market, it will have to join the single market, probably via the European Economic Area, along with Norway.Labour could go along with that in the end, since it wants friction-free access to the EU markets. Single market membership would solve the Irish border problem, for sure.But it would also mean Britain continuing to contribute to the EU Budget, while having no say over decisions taken by Brussels. Customs union membership requires oversight by the European Court of Justice, which will displease many.But that wouldnrsquot be the main problem. If Labour got this wonderful deal, including workersrsquo rights and environmental standards, and got it through Parliament , would it really then campaign against it in the confirmatory referendum Interviewers have largely stopped asking this question, because they never get an answer, but Europe remains a huge question mark hanging over Labourrsquos government agenda.Labour is still a Brexit party, though you wouldnrsquot know it to listen to most MPs.

Why, despite shting phenomenal amounts in novel form, some  million sold to date, and being a relative success on stage, has His Dark Materials never lit up the screen successfully Some pound million was spent on a , all bells and whistles movie which, praise for armoured polar bears and Nicole Kidman aside, failed to fly. Now the BBC and HBO have splashed a rumoured pound million on an eight part adaptation for television.Worth it  While first impressions were favourable, that is still a lot of money. One and a half new BBC Scotland channels to be precise, or , licence fees for over s.Jack Thorne, the writer of Shameless and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, was in charge of the adaptation. He gave little quarter to anyone unfamiliar with the novels. After a brief introduction covering the all-powerful ruling elite, known as the Magisterium, and a prophecy about a special child, we were pitched into a world very much like this world, yet somehow not. Welcome to the endless strangeness and complexities of Pullmanrsquos universe.Previous adaptations have fallen down in trying to get across the trilogyrsquos many and complex themes too soon. Wisely, this production homed in instead on the ldquodaemons, the spirit animals that encapsulate the souls of the humans to which they are attached. Scientist and explorer Lord Asriel James McAvoy, one of several Scots in the cast including James Cosmo and Gary Lewis has a very cool snow leopard as his daemon. His orphaned niece, Lyra, the child on whom so much will depend, has a stoat. Who doesnrsquot love a super furry animal that can talk British-Spanish actress Dafne Keen is excellent as the fearless, inquisitive Lyra, her dark features calling to mind the heroine of Panrsquos Labyrinth. McAvoy makes an awesome adventurer, never happier than when there is a swash to be buckled.Asriel has just blown in from the frozen north with tales of a mysterious substance he calls ldquodust. The existence of this material, which appears to conceal other worlds, is contrary to the Magisteriumrsquos teachings. It is the kind of information, indeed, that could topple empires.The mentions of ldquodust had unfortunate comic echoes of the Little Britain sketch about a slimming group leader who tells members that dust is all they can eatthey want to lose weight. The daemons, for all they were delightful in the main, took a while to get used to. When we could see their lips move it was obvious they were talking when we could not, their seemingly disembodied voices only added to the mounting confusion.Just when the story showed signs of slipping away, something happened that bodes well for any television drama: Ruth Wilson rocked up to play the mesmerising and beautul Mrs Coulter. Offering Lyra a job and the chance to move to London, the character played by the star of Luther and The Affair seems a dream come true for motherless Lyra. But her daemon is a gorgeous but terrying golden monkey - so make of that business what you will.By episode end, Asriel was racing back to the North, and scores of others were heading to London in search of vanished children. With armoured polar bears and Lin-Manuel Mirandastill to come, it would be a brave soul indeed who bailed on His Dark Materials this early.

Does he think that would be a fine example of democracy From the start the vote referendum was not sufficiently clear on the implications of leaving as no prior discussions appear to have been held with EU member states. No details were given on any options we could have with trading within the EU and where worldwide, in effect a sort of fait accompli. No comments were made whatsoever over what must have been blindingly obvious regarding border controls, in particular the Northern Ireland Eire one. That was the point when consultations with the ordinary people should have been made, before the vote and not now after the horse has bolted as Mr Mackay suggests.We have already had a ldquoonce in a letime vote regarding independence which the SNP is determined to hold again, so does he suggest we should follow suit with the Leave Remain EU one and throw democracy out with the bath water I voted Remain but grudgingly accepted the decision as that was the majorityrsquos wish. We now appear to be running the risk of those who feel denied their own wish to just re-run votes until they achieve their own desired result which, with such close results in both referendums, is a recipe for unrest. What should now be done is to discuss changes to the way we vote to give more meaningful results in future rather than the one vote either way first past the post system we currently have.George Dale, Beith.IF there is ever to be an Indyref the question to be asked must be fair, unbiased and easily understood.As evidenced by the question posed in the Brexit referendum, the opinion of the Electoral Commission is that a simple Yes No question is unfair as it contains an inherent bias in favour of the positivity of Yes against the negativity of No. It is encouraging therefore that Holyroodrsquos cross-party finance and constitution committee has recognised this in calling for more scrutiny of the question to be asked in any Indyref, instead of simply rubber-stamping the underhand attempt by the SNP to gain advantage by repeating the Yes No question asked in  .In demanding Indyref, it is clear that the objective of the SNP is to leave the UK union and join the EU, but there are concerns that a Leave  Remain question might confuse some as it carries echoes of Brexit. One question which goes to the heart of the matter and adopts the style used in  would be ldquoShould Scotland be part of the UK or part of the EU  UK or EU. There is no bias in the question and the choice could not be clearer.Alan Fitzpatrick, Dunlop.THE result of the election will be, in Scotland, a barometer of attitudes towards both Brexit and Scottish secession. It will be interesting to see how many of the SNPrsquos habitual voters who chose to leave the EU will remain SNP voters. A figure of around one-third of SNP voters represents Brexiters. Those seeking to support a Remain party have an easy choice: vote LibDem. Yet for those who oppose secession from the UK there really is only one choice: evenit means holding onersquos nose, one must vote for the party best-placed to defeat the SNP candidate. That will normally be the candidate who came second in , although in some cases, such as Ross, Cromarty and Skye ndash the constituency of Ian Blackford ndash it will not. That constituency has a strong Lib Dem heritage, and Remainers can vote Lib Dem happily.Nicola Sturgeon has made it clear that the issue in this election is Scotlandrsquos place in the UK. This is allied to a  claim that a Scotland could remain in the EU. Pro-Union people need to vote, and to vote for the party best-placed to unseat an SNP MP or to prevent an SNP candidate from winning.Jill Stephenson, EH.WHATEVER view we might hold about Brexit most people in Scotland must find it of great importance that we must defend our NHS. Our health service is under attack from two angles. First US health care companies want to get into health care contracts in the UK to make profits from that, and also the big drug companies in the US want to force the NHS to pay more for drugs, indeed as much as an additional pound billion for starters to get us level with prices in the US.So this is a time to look at our politicians now seeking our votes and make an important judgment. In a vote in the Westminster Parliament to protect the NHS the Tories predictably voted against, but the Liberals abstained. Now we know where the Tories stand on the NHS, they will sell it offthey get a deal they like with the US. So why did the Liberals not support the NHS, can Jo Swinson explain this to us when she is looking for Scottish votes Andy Anderson, Saltcoats.IF I hear any more politicians telling me that at last we will be able to use our vote to determine what party will win and get on with Brexit, I will despair. We have already done that ndash in General Elections, in referenda, and in local elections and European elections ndash but to no avail. Our politicians donrsquot give a toss who we elect or what we want, and at the moment it would appear that it would be extremely possible that a government will be elected ndash probably another minority government and we will start  in exactly the same situation where we find ourselves just now.I mean, letrsquos look at our choices. A party led by a despotic, bully-boy private school pupil, who thinks he is still at school, and held to account not by his members or electorate, but by an evil unelected manipulator who lurks in the shadows. A party led by a devoted Marxist who at least admits to his beliefs , and leads another ided main party which was once a great party. A party led by an unelected and unopposed leader, anxious to talk about nothing but Brexit to avoid scrutiny over what has happened to all the countryrsquos money when its services continue to fall and implode. A party led by a leader who resolutely refuses to live up to the word ldquodemocrat, which is part of her partyrsquos name, but which she and her party members have redefined as ldquodemocrat as long as you agree with us. A party led by a leader determined to leave the European Community at whatever cost, and who seems to appear on television and radio more than any other politician, despite him not holding a seat.You kindly printed a letter which I sent to you at the time of this yearrsquos European elections, when for the first time in my le, I refused to vote for any candidate , and asked sincerely: why we do not have a box in our ballot papers which allows us to vote, but at the same time express our opposition to the candidates and or parties who wish our votes  Compulsory voting should be introduced to this country as soon as possible, so that we could become like all eligible Australian citizens, for example, who are required to register to vote, to actually vote in all of its elections, and are penalisedthey do not vote.

In Orkney, Police have joined up with Orkney Road Safety forum, to encourage cyclists to remain safe and visible, with not only education, but the handing out of bike lights.Police are reminding cyclists that along with obeying all traffic signs, traffic light signals and not cycling on pavements, they must equip their bikes with the appropriate lights and make sure they are lit when it starts to get dark.Officers in Orkney will be proactively looking to address cyclists who ignore the legislative requirement to illuminate their bikes in darkness, and will be providing bike lights to those who need them. Just over  pairs of bike lights have been purchased using funding from Police Scotland Safer Communities for this purpose.#Visibility is key to keeping cyclists safe on the roads and I would encourage cyclists to ensure they wear bright reflective clothing and illuminate lights on their bikes, both front and rear, in order to make themselves more visible to other road users,# said chief inspector, Matthew Webb.#This is equally applicable during the day, but more important at dusk and when it#s dark, to avoid collisions and warn other road users to their presence.#Some cyclists wear dark clothing and particularly on faster roads they can be almost invisible to drivers until they are close to them.#He added: #I recognise in this rural community that a lot of the measures are equally applicable to the equine community and they are more than welcome to make use of the same free offer.#This initiative has been supported by the Orkney Road Safety Forum who will assist with the distribution of these lights, which in addition to the police office, are available from the OIC hubs and Scottish Fire and Rescue Service Community Safety Advocacy.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Ours is a realistic and pragmatic model.mdash Secretary PompeoNovember , With a hand-delivered letter, the US is the first nation to pull out of the deal. Agreement rules prevented any country from pulling out in the first three years after ratication on November  .President Donald Trump has been promising withdrawal for two years, but Monday was the first time he could actually do it.His decision was condemned as a reckless failure of leadership by environmental experts, activists and critics such as former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.ldquoDonald Trump is the worst president in history for our climate and our clean air and water, said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club. ldquoLong after Trump is out of office, his decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement will be seen as a historic error. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Donald Trump--The agreement set goals of preventing another .C to C of warming from current levels.

Because of the expected withdrawal, the US role in  negotiations will be reduced, experts said.Climate change, largely caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas, has already warmed the world by C since the late s, caused massive melting of ice globally, triggered weather extremes and changed ocean chemistry. Scientists say that depending on how much carbon dioxide is emitted, it will only get worse by the end of the century, with temperatures jumping by several degrees and oceans rising by close to ft.Mr Trump has been threatening to pull out of the Paris deal since , often mischaracterising the terms of the agreement, which are voluntary. In October, he called it a massive wealth transfer from America to other nations and said it was one-sided.That is not the case, experts said.For example, the US goal mdash set under Barack Obama mdash had been to reduce carbon dioxide emission in  by % to % compared with  levels. This translates to about % compared with  levels.The European Unionrsquos goal was to cut carbon pollution in  by % compared with  levels, which is greater than Americarsquos pledge, said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University professor and chairman of the Global Carbon Project.

They weren’t just losing but being ground into the south-west London soil.We know now the miracle very nearly came off, with Scotland leading - on the last play of the game, only to let in England once again to close out a - draw.

It was my team, my country, and I still get goosebumps thinking about it.: South Africa captain Siya Kolisi ready for shot at history: Defence coach says England can pile pressure on South AfricaBut whisper it up here, Scotland’s shock treatment might just have sparked England’s progress to the Rugby World Cup final in Tokyo, because since that March day they have only lost once, in August when a second string side including only six of today’s starters lost a World Cup warm-up - to Wales in Cardf. A week later, a team featuring  of today’s opening line-up thrashed Ireland -. The chances are anyone reading this column will already know whether Owen Farrell has held the Webb Ellis Trophy aloft orhe was down on his hunkers in despair as the honour fell to a victorious South African captain Siya Kolisi. And I should want the Cup to be raised for the first time by a black Springbok skipper.Pipe band member in But I don’t. I want to see the Veldt Leviathans cut open by the skills of Farrell and George Ford, honed on dimly lit rugby league grounds at Wigan St Pats and Bradford, because I’m supporting England. Always have. Ever since that collection of Esso  Mexico World Cup football coins was completed, I’ve backed England when they aren’t playing us.I was in the pipe band in  when Kenny Dalglish stuck the ball through Ray Clemence’s legs, my mates came back from Wembley the following year with tufts of grass and bits of wood they said were from the obviously tubular goal posts, and in  alongside everyone  I laughed along with Andy Cameron and ‘We’re on the March with Ally’s Army’ and sat stunned as we were undone by Cubillas and Peru. But it was striking how the rest of the country seemed to want Scotland to do well in Argentina, in contrast to those blokes who head to the pub wearing the football shirts of countries they can’t locate on a map when England play.In  I was playing for Preston Grasshoppers when the Grand Slam was won, where Wade Dooley was still learning his trade and couldn’t know he’d experience what it was like to lose to Scotland in a title decider six years later. That day I turned out for Furness RUFC from Barrow, the only Scot in a packed clubhouse where afterwards everyone patted my back and shook my hand asI’d actually been playing at Murrayfield. This morning I’ll be texting a couple of my team-mates from that day.A gun to Zeffirelli’s headYears living in England, playing rugby union and covering professional rugby league has made me feel as much part of their game as ours. The rest of the house is solidly behind England too, but at least my we can justy her support on account of actually being English.

But I’ve never seen the need to wallow in every set-back suffered by English teams to demonstrate pride in my heritage and culture or the dferences between us, and I’m as quick as the next Scot when abroad to correct anyone who thinks I’m from where. Like the woman in Arizona who saw me in a kilt and askedI was Irish.I am reminded of the story told by Italian film director Franco Zeffirelli when he was a partisan fighter during the War. Trapped between Allied and German forces he gave himself up to what he hoped were friendly troops. “English ” he called, and thought his le was over when a soldier shouted back “No” in a guttural tone he didn’t recognise and put a gun near his head. The soldier hissed, “We’re f***ing Scottish.”Seven ministers in seven yearsTalking of culture, seven ministers in seven years is not a musical based on government departments, but it should be at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, where this week Nicky Morgan announced she will be the latest Secretary of State to depart since Jeremy Hunt’s elevation to health in .For us in the news business, it’s a key appointment, but no sooner had the industry got to know what Maria Miller, Sajid Javid, John Whittingdale, Karen Bradley, Matt Hancock and Jeremy Wright were all about, than it was usually time to move on.Ms Morgan has only been in the job three months, not even enough time to pop into the News Media Association offices for a spot of lunch. Nowhere will her departure be more keenly felt than amongst the senior civil servants she leaves behind who have seen them all come and go but in such a short space of time were thoroughly impressed by the speed with which she mastered complex issues and her ability to absorb a brief instantly.If Ruth Davidson can be offered £k for two days work a month, the ex-education secretary and treasury select committee chair won’t be short of offers.Edinburgh Christmas market: Treatment of memorial benches a disgraceAsthe mesh of steel currently spreading across Princes Street Gardens wasn’t shocking enough, the pictures circulated on social media of memorial benches carelessly heaped up in a corner by construction workers like an abandoned game of Jenga symbolised an equal lack of concern behind Edinburgh council’s decision to let it happen.It would be going too far to say the council officers who allowed the Christmas Market operator Underbelly to proceed with their scheme without submitting a planning application couldn’t care less about the benches, but the evidence strongly suggests they didn’t care enough to make sure it didn’t happen.Administration councillors were quick to respond on Twitter to tell the public how terrible it was, that immediate action would be taken, that it shouldn’t have happened, but the fact is it did.At every meeting of Edinburgh council, we on the Conservative seats listen to one SNP councillor after another boasting about the fantastic job they are doing to protect the city centre, but on this occasion they are responsible for the despoliation one of Edinburgh’s most treasured places.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"general election 2019 lib dems call for labour to stand aside in scotland","story":"The escalating row among parties over who should contest which seat at next months general election took a further twist as the Lib Dems called for Labour to \"stand aside\" in Scotland.Willie Rennie said the party north of the Border had been left \"humiliated\" by UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his recent comments regarding a second referendum on Scottish independence.The Lib Dems believe they stand the best chance among the pro-Union parties of winning several marginal seats currently held by the Nationalists, with North East Fe - won by Stephen Gethins in  with a majority of just two - top of their list.Debate has raged in recent weeks among the parties and their activists on where electoral resources should be concentrated.

Butthis is rejected, what other options are out there for the SNP:Wildcat Referendum This would see the Scottish Government forge ahead with a vote regardless of the legal position, perhaps insisting they have a mandate from the Scottish peoplenot Westminster. It would win widespread support from grassroots nationalists who are hungry for action, but this approach in Catalonia only resulted in Madrid sending in troops on the ground and the leaders of the pro-independence campaign, who organised the vote, being jailed. Although such a hardline approach met with widespread criticism, it has done nothing to further the independence movement. Nicola Sturgeon has so far ruled out such an approach, insisting it wont gain international recognitionLegal challenge Both Nicola Sturgeon and and her Constitution Secretary mike Russell were notably cagey about the prospect of a legal challenge when quizzed about this at the SNP conference in Aberdeen last month.After the success of the SNP Home Affairs spokeswoman Joanna Cherry in spearheading the UK Supreme Court challenge against Boris Johnsons unlawful proroguing of Parliament, the party may feel going down the legal route is a feasible option. Its not clear what the grounds for challenge would be, but a number of constitutional experts believe that Holyrood may already have the authority to hold a legal referendum on independence under the devolution settlement - and the matter would at least be worth putting to the legal test. The problem is that, the Scottish Parliament would definitely not have the authority to implement independence in the event of a yes vote under such a scenario. It may nonetheless be seen as a legitimate way to test public opinion, although the the prospect of a boycott by unionists may scupper this. Unilateral Declaration of IndependenceSenior Nationalists, including ex-Health Secretary Alex Neil and Western Isles MP Angus MacNeil have talked up such an approach. This would see the Scottish Government open independence negotiations in the event of a majority SNP victory at a Holyrood or Westminster election. A motion was brought to the SNPs party conference seeking a change n policy to adopt UDI as a \"Plan B\"a Section  is not successful. but it was rejected by delegates and Nicola Sturgeon has spoken out against such an approach.Non co-operation Although unlikely, the SNP could opt to live a bit dangerously to increase the pressure for independence. The Scottish Government has signicant powers in a range of areas which could be utilised to make le very dficult for Westminster. For example the Greens have been agitating for tighter controls on the transportation of nuclear weapons from the Faslane naval base, with some claims that Holyroods control of environmental laws could even effectively thwart their passage through Scotland in order to be \"serviced\" at Aldermaston. The current SNP Transport Secretary Michael Matheson has previously sought to introduce legislation which would criminalise ministers who prepare the way for the use of nuclear weapons. Thequestion is whether such a confrontational approach would alienate voters from the independence cause. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

I do think the government has to recognise the costs up here.#Ms Henderson described food bank usage as #shocking in this day and age#, and highlighted the Trussel Trust – the organisation behind the food bank – which had data on who is accessing the service.#Once you#ve got clearer information on the problem you can look at ways of dealing with it.#She described as #a sin# that perfectly good food was being thrown out by supermarkets just because it was at or near its sell-by date.Mr Robinson said the government#s roll-out of the universal credit was at the #root cause# of the problem.#It#s been an absolute shambles. How they expected folk could go for weeks without any money at all, just with the the promise it would be sorted out, I think is disgraceful.#He said the much-maligned #bedroom tax# had also been a contributing factor, and added it was important for people both in public and private sectors to have a fair living wage.Ms Valente said she had been shocked by the numbers of people who needed to use the food bank but were too ashamed of their poverty.#The cost of housing is one of the things I find quite shocking,# she said, adding that people needed to #earn a huge amount of money# to put a roof over their heads.She was also #appalled# by universal credit, and added it was wrong for society to #really target# or make people feel bad about being poor.Mr Wenger said people were encouraged to go to Citizens Advice Bureau, which could advise people on how to manage their finances.But Debra Nicolson, who stood as the Green candidate in the recent Holyrood campaign, pressed for more information on what candidates would doelected.Other questions were asked about the stigma attached to free school meals, and how it can be tackled.Ms Valente said responsibility lay with the government, but stressed the council needed to ensure social work staff and support services were fully prepared to help.Mr Robinson pointed to the -plus housing waiting list, and stressed affordable housing was key to solving the problem.Ms Henderson added there was an #antiquated rule# in the council that a percentage of the housing stock had to be kept free in case there was an emergency, and added she had argued that should be scrapped because #people need houses now#.Mr Flaws added there would always be a stigma until people are prepared to talk more openly about it.Mr Wenger said beating stigma, and preventing discrimination, needed to start at an early age. He added SSE had raised energy prices three times in one year, and stressed the issue should be picked up in the council.A former councillor, Iris Hawkins, wondered how well the candidates would adjust to #le in the goldfish bowl.#Mr Wenger said many people knew him already as a postman and as a tourist guide. He said he was a member of Transition Shetland.As a German, he said people had noticed his lack of Shetland dialect, although he admitted having problems with English accents, too.#The most problems I have with the English isI look down to the #sooth-moothers# at  Downing Street#.Ms Valente said being a councillor meant #you can#t win#, because pleasing one person would mean upsetting another.#You just have to do the best job that you can so you can sleep at night with a clean conscience.#You just have to do the best job that you can so you can sleep well at night with a clean conscience# FRANCIS VALENTEMr Robinson has #been there before#. He said the hardest thing was the impact being a councillor can have on elected members# families.#You do have to really know what you#re in for.#Mr Flaws said he had read the hardest part was putting yourself forward in the first place.#To actually make the decision and say #this is the time. It suits me now#. Once that#s done you just have to get on with it.#As for Ms Henderson, she stressed she would be #very happy# to be accountable from the start.#There will be no curtains in my goldfish bowl,# she said.The site of a new Gilbert Bain Hospital was then brought up by chairman Jim Anderson, with Mr Robinson – who chairs NHS Shetland – left feeling distinctly on the spot.#I think wherever the site is it needs to be somewhere that is close to,not within, Lerwick. That#s going to be one of the real challenges.#Mr Wenger had his eye across the Bressay Sound.#Build the fixed link to Bressay, and build the Gilbert Bain Hospital on Bressay,# he told Mr Anderson.Mr Flaws admitted there were few options on where the hospital could be built.#You have to be looking on the outskirts of Lerwick – the south road or the north road.#Ms Valente said there was no easy solution.#I suspect any decision to build the hospital is going to be  years down the road.#Ms Henderson said any consideration needed to be #future-proofed#. But she said she was prepared to look outside of the town for the solution.#If you#ve got really good shuttle links that would ease some of the congestion. If you have it nearer Tingwall it#s more central for the rest of the islands.#If you have it nearer Tingwall it#s more central for the rest of the islands# CAROLINE HENDERSONGreen issues were raised by Debra Nicolson, who said the SIC#s economic strategy was supportive of Sullom Voe and the gas plant until at least . Where did the candidates stand on this in light of the climate emergency Mr Flaws said he believed that was why the council had not yet declared a climate emergency.#The council is going to have to update its carbon management plan and see how it is going to bring this forward.#The council needs to be more transparent on what their long-term thinking is.#Part of the discussion focused on the Viking Energy windfarm.Ms Henderson said it was dficult to address Sullom Voe #until they#ve said what they want to do#.She added she was #not a fan# of the inter-connector, and the Viking windfarm was #not a green scheme – it#s only green in the context of money#.Meanwhile, Mr Robinson said the council should declare a climate emergency #and not worry about the oil companies#.He said BP had a #huge solar arm# in its organisation, while Total also promoted its environmental credentials and the Danish Dong Energy had gone completely out of the oil and gas sector.#Without declaring the emergency I don#t think there#s any real impetus to do anything.#Without declaring the emergency I don#t think there#s any real impetus to do anything– GARY ROBINSONMr Wenger said Sullom Voe helped provide the UK with oil and gas.But he said attitudes were changing, particularly with a growth in electric car usage.#Electricity you can produce without burning fossil fuels is the best.#Ms Valente said it was impossible to get rid of fossil fuels #over night#, but stressed thinking had to start now.#Maybe Shetland can do without Sullom Voe but the economy of Britain still depends on that. We need to bring it down and work on other solutions.#But I think the council does need to declare a climate emergency.#Questions were also raised on ferry links to the mainland, with concerns voiced about the number of cabins and the freight constraints.Ms Valente said the boats were #not fit for purpose,# and added capacity for freight was #dreadful#.Mr Robinson said Shetland should be able to design a ferry to suit its own needs. He said the real problems with NorthLink vessels lay at constraints at Aberdeen Harbour, as well as regulations which limited where on a vessel cabins could be placed.#To my mind we really should have the power locally to resolve our own ferry service, so we can design something that works for us.#Mr Flaws said the ferries were commissioned roughly  years ago. He said it was dficult for his family of five to get away on the ferry.#They#re just not fit for purpose. We need to say what we need rather than be told what we should be using.#Discussion also focused on the bus service, with support for cheaper – or even,possible, free – buses being offered.Mr Flaws said it would be good to see more people using buses.#If it was cheaper or free then maybe more folk would be using it. If that was an incentive to get more folk on it, then that should be looked at,# although he acknowledged some bus times did not suit everybody.Ms Valente cited an occasion when she lived in Sandveien when the bus could get her to work just before am.#They they changed the service, so that actually you either had to get to work by half eight or half nine. It#s just ridiculous. I do not know how that happened.#Mr Wenger said e-buses – smaller units which can be called upon using an app – should be adopted. He added he had enjoyed a positive experience with an electric bike.Mr Robinson – a convert to the bike himself – said there was no easy answer on buses.#The last thing you want to do is run a bus with three folk on it when in actual fact that#s causing a bigger carbon footprint than a car with three folk in it.#He berated the absence of any buses in Shetland that ran on anything other than diesel. He cited Dundee, which had a number of electric taxis.Questions were raised about how a councillor might get things discussed with other members.Mr Robinson said climate change was something he would consider attempting to raise a notice of motion over – a measure which would ensure the topic is debated in the chamber.#That is one thing the council has failed to move on so far. I suspectyou were to canvas the councillors and ask them to sign it, you#d probably get half the councillors for a start. I fail to understand why they#ve not moved on it. It#s ridiculous.#Mr Flaws said an issue that kept coming back was that people had no idea what the council#s strategy was with sustainable energy.#It#s Viking Energy, or it#s nothing,# he said.Ms Valente said she wanted to ensure everyone#s house was insulated.#There are people living in houses that are cold. There are people who can not afford to do it and are choosing between putting the heating on and having something to eat.#Mr Wenger said council office buildings should be insulated, but Ms Henderson said it was important to deal with the issues constituents bring forward. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"no general election candidate for greens ","story":"The decision comes after the party learned that they would not be allowed to put forward two candidates who,successful, would have worked on a job-share basis.Debra Nicolson wanted to stand as a co-candidate in the general election.

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3.-Dogstar-Theatre-The-Stornoway-Way-by-Kevin-MacNeil.-Naomi-Stirrat-Roman-Stornoway-Photo-credit-Leila-Angus.jpg","title":"the stornoway way finds humour in dark tale of life on","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIf le is a search formeaning and purpose, Roman Stornoway has strayed from the preordained pathways ofhis native Lewis.The road to contentmentdoes not lead to kirk or croft. Instead, it leads to the booze aisle in thelocal supermarket and to a drinking den out on the moor.In this, the maincharacter in Kevin MacNeil’s novel ‘The Stornoway Way’ is depicted as havingmuch in common with his fellow islanders, whether or not they absorb their localminister’s thunderous moralising. Theplay of the same name, which MacNeil also wrote, pulls no punches so far asdevastating social critique is concerned.There’s a lot in a name. RomanStornoway can be read as romance torn away. He is also R Stornoway. He is a religiouscuckoo in the nest and the key in a roman a clef. The character himselfacknowledges all this. As an everyman outsider, Mister S is meant tocommunicate a great deal about Lewis.Calvinism, alcohol and climatecombine in a pernicious cocktail that permeates people and place. Depression, repression and addiction are endemic.So are dreams of escape.If this is the desolate reality in which MacNeil’s characters are immersed, the play of the novel # staged by Dogstar Theatre at Sabhal Mor Ostaig last week # sugars the pill with scabrous wit, hilarious minor characters, and some truly moving songs, among them a traditional Gaelic lament rendered with crystalline clarity by Lewis-born actor Rachel Kennedy. It is a sublime moment where Roman reconnects with the culture he scorns. But the moment passes, and the song of loss and love is soon replaced with cynicism and tomorrow’s hangover.All good writing, whetherfor page or stage, interweaves the personal, the local and the universal. Roman’s war is with himself and with Lewishis dreams are of finding love and self-fulfilment. The universal arrives inthe shape of Eva, a Hungarian student who initially succumbs to Roman’s scatterguncharm, but who later comes to see him as self-obsessed and manipulative. Roman is certainly that. Heis also vulnerable, funny, and capable of great profundity.Self-fulfilment comesthrough music, and when Roman’s long-suffering best friend Eilidh organises asession for him in a recording studio in Edinburgh, the road to salvationopens. But Roman is a master at self-sabotage. Matters don’t quite go to plan.Naomi Stirrat as Roman,Rachel Kennedy as Eilidh and Chloe-Ann Tylor as Eva are all fine actors, and adeptat lively theatricality. As an ensemble,they tick like a Swiss watch, darting here and there without missing a beat. Andthey can’t half belt out a tune. As with all adaptations,there are issues concerning the episodic aspect of narrative fiction and how thisworks on stage, in real-time. In ‘The Stornoway Way’ scene transitions areheralded by brief drum patterns that wouldn’t sound out of place in an Americansitcom. But that is to cavil. MacNeil’s play is at least as good as his novel, and the novel was very good indeed."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LOCHALSH-MOD-19-KYLEAKIN-PS-1.jpg","title":"competition underway to create a flag for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoinen.This weeksees the launch of a competition to design a flag, which will be recognised by the Court of Lord Lyon — the body responsible for recording and protecting all heraldry, flags and national symbols in Scotland — and will be flown and displayed as an emblem of the island at home and abroad., Highland Council ward members and tourism body SkyeConnect petitioned the court with the idea for a flag following the example of several other island areas and regions which have, in recent years, adopted a flag.Philip Tibbetts, honorary vexillologist with the Court of the Lord Lyon, is to visit schools on the island next week to deliver a series of workshops and presentations detailing his interest in flags, and discussing the themes which could potentially inspire a flag for Skye.It is hoped youngsters and adults will be keen to have a go at designing the flag, and enter the competition which will run from st November until st December, after which a  — made up of representatives from throughout the community — will compile a short list of final entries which will then become subject of a public vote in February of next year.or by post to Skye Flag Competition, c o West Highland Free Press, Unit B, Pairc nan Craobh, Broadford, Isle of Skye IV AP, the potential for both the design and subsequent usage of a flag for the island is incredible.”In addition to the information provided on this page, these links will be helpful:"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LOVAT-STUART-MACDONALD-2-adj.jpg","title":"shinty hurling to take centre stage as scotland visit face ireland this","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTwo Kinlochshiel players, Finlay MacRae and Donald Nixon, are in the Scotland squad for the senior shinty-hurling match.At under- level Alan MacRae has named a -man squad seeking to seal a second win in succession against the Irish.Skye#s William MacKinnon is in line for his debut, while there is also a place in the squad for Johnnie MacAskill, the ex-Kinlochshiel player, now playing for Glasgow Mid Argyll.

Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her.Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she did it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family.Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care.This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  .We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us.This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby.We decided to host Rubys Birthday Fundraiser last year and it was a huge success, raising an amazing pound,. The whole community and local business were fully behind us and couldn’t have done it without them.

I continue to tell my story of grief and Ruby’s le on my blog Chasingladybirds it has been a good way help journey through grief and to also reach out to others in the same situation.Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started.In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief.Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.Admission costs pound for adults and children go free.

completion has the potential to transform lives, commenting: “This new amenity will be a game changer for the local community, and will hopefully motivate more iniduals who lead sedentary lestyles to increase their physical activity level and enjoy the health benefits that regular exercise brings.“It’s long been our ambition to see this section of riverside trail extended and enhanced so that the recreational value of this wonderful environmental asset can be fully appreciated.“Creating a riverside trail was first identied as a viable project in the Gilford Village Plan . Today we come together - community, council, funders and key contributors - to celebrate its successful completion. Well done to all involved!”The completion of this second phase of works on council-owned land has created a scenic riverside trail that stretches  metres and connects Bridge Street and Gilford Community Centre to the attractive Woodlands Park, passing the iconic Gilford Mill building along the way.In addition to creating a short section of walkway over the remains of the old millrace and constructing a new footbridge across the millrace, the council undertook associated works to enhance the trail including landscaping, installing street furniture, lighting and interpretative .The second phase has been completed thanks to £, in funds allocated by SOAR’s Local Action Group. This project was part funded under Priority of the Northern Ireland Rural Development Programme - from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the European Union.Chair of SOAR ABC Roisin McAliskey added: “This project has been completed to an exceptionally high standard, and is exemplary ofhow funds from SOAR’s Rural Village Renewal scheme can be used to support the implementation of local village plans.”Open to the public since July, the new trail is already proving to be a popular destination for walkers, runners and cyclists.Welcoming completion of the trail, Jerome Burns, Contracts Manager, Southern Rural Affairs Division at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs  said: “This trail has been completed as part of a suite of village enhancement measures financed through the Village Renewal strand of the Leader Rural Development Programme. It provides a great opportunity for everyone to enjoy the many benefits of outdoor activity, and it is an excellent example of how DAERA is delivering on its vision of a ‘living, working, active landscape valued by everyone.”Given its proximity to Gilford Community Centre, this marvellous amenity set in an attractive riverside setting greatly complements the centre with its excellent indoor and outdoor facilities including a climbing wall, trim trail, picnic tables, pump track, canoe landings and beginners’ canoe slalom course.Alternative Heat are set to expand the firm Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"The council acknowledges with thanks the co-operation of the owners of Gilford Mill, Karl Asset Management, which enabled this project to proceed along with The MWA Partnership Ltd, Landscape Architects and A.G.

I really trust him and the cast can see how his mind works as a director.”Known for her comedic roles, Katie spoke of how it was great to sink her teeth into a dramatic role. “This is a real love story of a middle class Protestant who falls in love with an Irish rebel – and we’ll leave it there,” she laughed.“I don’t want to give too much away. Myself and fellow actor Maria Connolly are on stage the whole time, linking the threadsyou like. It is such a lovely piece of writing by Kate.“Kate’s son Sean, one of the forces behind the Dead Rabbit Bar in New York, will be offering an Irish coffee before the show courtesy of the bar as well. It is a very limited run, just over two nights, but it’s wonderful that audiences will be able to see Kate’s final work.”The piece, produced by GBL Productions’ Briege Lynch, is an emotional one for all involved as Briege said she knew Kate since she was four.“I’m very honoured to have Betrothed as my first producing credit,” she said. “I’ve known and loved Kate since I was four running in and out of the Community Arts Forum offices as a young child where my dad, Martin, was director and Kate was the administrator. I probably got under her feet a lot but she was always so kind and caring and would sneak me treats. I’m sad that she isn’t here to bask in the glory of getting this writing from the page to the stage.”Betrothed by Kate Muldoon runs at the Grand Opera House in the Baby Grand from November  and .

The event will also see launch of a groundbreaking new report that outlines a framework for community development.The paper, entitled ‘We Must Dissent’, is the result of a community survey that assessed the human rights of local residents against the major issues facing the area. Amongst the issues identied were concerns around road safety, housing, health, education, and unemployment.Another key issue was the pressures of commercial land speculation in the area, which has presented an obstacle to the community development of the Lanyon Tunnels.Despite planning permission and £.million being granted for the development, plans have been stalled by owners of an adjacent piece of land – which was subject to plans to build a £million office block.In , residents won a legal victory when the High Court ruled that planning approval for office block was unlawful. However, the potential for future plans to develop the land could impede access to the tunnelsgiven the go-ahead.Speaking ahead of next Wednesday’s event, Fionntán Hargey from the Market Development Association said the tunnels development would provide a “massive boost to people’s self esteem”.“It would physically reconnect them to city centre and it would also reconnect them into the economic, social and cultural le of Belfast. “The tunnels got planning permission in , and there is £. million in funding sitting there ready to go, and there are three groups of residents trained up and they’ve got business places developed. We also have updated drawings that have recently been commissioned. “The issue is that there is a private developer who is refusing to grant access to allow the project to go ahead.”He continued: “Next Wednesday will refresh people on the latest concept drawings and give people wider overview of the Redeveloping the Local Economy programme. Our aspiration is that by January we will be launching a report, and we will have several groups of residents with business ideas that are on course for development.” Next Wednesday’s event will take place at pm in the Market Community Centre where guest speaker, Dr Sean Byers, will discuss the economics of community empowerment. There will also be a full project update on the Lanyon Tunnels."},{"url":null,"title":"alex kane it may be hung on remain vs leave but the pacts are just oldfashioned orange vs green","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Regaining two MPswould be an enormous fillup for the party after the setbacks of  and would set them up nicely for the next Assembly election .For Sinn Fein it’s primarily about levelling with, or nudging ahead of the DUP in both seats and votes.

It needs to test the durability of its ‘surge’ in the Euro and council elections a few months ago and the most obvious way of doing that is to present itself as the only genuine ‘other’ alternative in every seat.Its chances of winning any seat don’t, on the surface, appear to be high. That said, I wouldn’t completely dismiss Long’s chances in East Belfast and it is likely that some small-u unionists might sht towards the party and keep up their percentage overall.The DUP and UUP have an ‘understanding’ in North Belfast and Fermanagh South Tyrone but may now look to reaching a broader one embracing South and East Belfast and North Down.

Higgins.Mannus was born in Canada but moved with his Northern Irish family back to their homeland at the age of seven.At yesterdays final, the former Linfield and St Johnstone goalkeeper, who also had spells at Larne and Carrick Rangers, ended up as one of Shamrock Rovers heroes.He saved a penalty in a shootout after the  minutes of normal and extra time ended in a - stalemate against the League of Ireland champions.Rovers won the shootout - and Mannus was immediately surrounded by his team-mates as they recorded their first FAI Cup win for  years in front of over , fans.One of his Rovers colleagues, Ronan Finn, hailed Mannus as the \"best goalkeeper in Ireland\".However, on social media Mannus - who brought a young child onto the pitch after the game to join in the celebrations - was subjected to a torrent of abuse over the Irish anthem issue.One condemned Mannus for failing to respect the anthem, adding that he \"doesnt have to sing but respect costs nothing\".Some of the attacks descended into sectarian abuse.Others said Mannus was one of our own and some defended the goalie, who has been capped nine times for Northern Ireland, insisting he was well within his rights to do whatever he wanted during the playing of the anthem.Several compared his approach to that of Londonderry-born Republic of Ireland international James McClean, who is subjected to regular criticism over his refusal to wear a poppy on his shirt at games in the Premier League in England.One poster said: \"The same people slaughtering Alan Mannus are the same people who do be up in arms when James McClean gets hate for standing up for his beliefs.\"Eleven years ago a Northern Ireland under- international was caught up in a similar controversy over the national anthem before an FAI Cup Final, where he was playing for Derry City against Bohemians.Sammy Morrow did not turn with other players to face the Irish flag, but he later said that he stood up straight with his head up to show his respect. He said he was disappointed and disheartened by the criticism levelled at him.There was also controversy over the pre-match ritual in the  Irish Cup final.Cltonville FC players appeared to bow their heads during the playing of God Save the Queen before their - defeat against Coleraine.Cltonville officials had requested that the song not be played before the game at Windsor Park."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/7857c/BINARY/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

remains a stark reality in Northern Ireland, a report has found..pushThe latest publication by the Independent Reporting Commissionsets out how the ongoing political vacuum, Brexit uncertainty and an increase in attacks has made ending paramilitarism “immeasurably more dficult”.The second report from the IRC on progress towards ending paramilitary activity in the region comes after a year which saw several murders.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Journalist Lyra McKee who was killed by dissident republicans as she observed a riot in Londonderry These include the killing of journalist Lyra McKee by dissident republicans in Londonderry in April, as well as the death of community worker Ian Ogle at the hands of loyalists in east Belfast in January.The last  months also saw a number of attacks including the detonation by dissidents of a bomb at Derry court house and the planting of an under-car bomb targeting a police officer which was discovered at a golf club.The IRC commissioners state that paramilitarism remains a stark reality in Northern Ireland, and continues to be a serious obstacle to peace and reconciliation.The commissioners also reiterated their analysis from their first report last October that ending paramilitarism “can only be sustainably brought about by means of a Twin Track Approach, which combines policing and justice responses alongside systemically tackling the serious socio-economic deprivation facing the communities where the paramilitaries operate”.In their second report, the commissioners recommend that tackling paramilitarism be made a new dedicated outcome in the Programme for Government as the best way of achieving the whole-of-system approach they believe is needed.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A car bomb exploding outside the court house on Bishop Street in Londonderry in January They point to the need for neighbourhood policing to be enhanced and for urgent action to address the delay in cases coming before the courts.The commissioners also highlight the need for increased asset recovery, recommending that an agency focusing solely on civil recovery of the proceeds of crime be established in Northern Ireland.To that end, the commissioners have called for a major public debate to begin, aware that their recommendations to end continuing paramilitary activity will need the support and confidence of the whole of society.The four commissioners include John McBurney and Monica McWilliams, who were nominated by the Northern Ireland Executive Tim O’Connor, nominated by the Irish Government, and

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

It was their acceptance of a regulatory border in the Irish Sea on the nd October, vigorously opposed by the Ulster Unionist Party, which opened the floodgates for Boris Johnson and his dreadful deal. The Union itself is now in a precarious position not in spite of the DUP’s stance but because of the DUP’s actions.“We have been in discussions with senior political and community figures across North Belfast. In doing so we listened respectfully to all views expressed, including deeply held concerns that they will be unrepresented in Westminster in the critical months ahead.“This has been done in the context of threats and intimidation against Ulster Unionist Party staff and members. In a modern democracy no one should have to face threats, intimidation or coercion of any sort because of their involvement in the democratic process. It is appalling and totally reprehensible and should have no place in Northern Ireland in the st century.“As Ulster Unionists it is our role to protect and promote the Union. Therefore it is absolutely vital that MPs are ed who will take their seats and be able to influence the future direction of our nation.“We are a party that believes first and foremost in the Union, and secondly in the importance of representative democracy. Therefore we have decided not to nominate a candidate in North Belfast in the forthcoming election. The DUP recognise that they cannot win North Belfast on their own, despite having dismissed the opinions of other unionists in the past. They cannot expect to continue on that basis and must now realise they need Ulster Unionist voices at Westminster.“The choice in North Belfast is between Nigel Dodds as MP or an abstentionist MP who refuses to stand in Westminster to talk about health, education, justice, international affairs, or the future direction of the United Kingdom. In the face of Boris Johnson’s terrible deal which forces Northern Ireland towards the edge of the Union, we cannot gt a seat to Sinn Fein who support this direction either in North Belfast or Fermanagh and South Tyrone.“It is better to elect Nigel Dodds in North Belfast and hold him to account for his promises on the Union than facilitate the election of an abstentionist Sinn Fein MP who still cannot condemn IRA violence. We acknowledge that this decision will be welcomed by some and will disappoint others, but we believe it is in the best interests of our country and the Union.”What he said in Belfaston October  ...“The UUP will be contesting every seat in the general election. We will be aiming to win back Fermanagh and South Tyrone from Sinn Fein and South Antrim from the DUP. There will be no pacts with the DUP under my leadership.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38658717.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Sinn-fein-GElection_announcement_.jpg","title":"general election sinn fein pulls out of three constituencies in race for westminster seats","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I wish she’d have been here, we all miss her as a family, no more so than her mum.“I’ve got to say, she was everything to all of us, she will always be missed but she will always be in our thoughts.”He added: “I want to hopefully show that the experience I’ve shown previously will continue.

The U.S. is proud of our record as a world leader in reducing all emissions, fostering resilience, growing our economy, and ensuring energy for our citizens. Ours is a realistic and pragmatic model.— Secretary PompeoNovember , With a hand-delivered letter, the US is the first nation to pull out of the deal. Agreement rules prevented any country from pulling out in the first three years after ratication on November  .President Donald Trump has been promising withdrawal for two years, but Monday was the first time he could actually do it.His decision was condemned as a reckless failure of leadership by environmental experts, activists and critics such as former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.“Donald Trump is the worst president in history for our climate and our clean air and water,” said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club. “Long after Trump is out of office, his decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement will be seen as a historic error.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Donald Trump The agreement set goals of preventing another .C to C of warming from current levels. Even the pledges made in  were not enough to prevent those levels of warming.The deal calls for nations to come up with more ambitious pollution cuts every five years, starting in November . Because of the expected withdrawal, the US role in  negotiations will be reduced, experts said.Climate change, largely caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas, has already warmed the world by C since the late s, caused massive melting of ice globally, triggered weather extremes and changed ocean chemistry. Scientists say that depending on how much carbon dioxide is emitted, it will only get worse by the end of the century, with temperatures jumping by several degrees and oceans rising by close to ft.Mr Trump has been threatening to pull out of the Paris deal since , often mischaracterising the terms of the agreement, which are voluntary. In October, he called it a massive wealth transfer from America to other nations and said it was one-sided.That is not the case, experts said.For example, the US goal — set under Barack Obama — had been to reduce carbon dioxide emission in  by % to % compared with  levels. This translates to about % compared with  levels.The European Union’s goal was to cut carbon pollution in  by % compared with  levels, which is greater than America’s pledge, said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University professor and chairman of the Global Carbon Project.

The Derry News last week reported that the number of -hour computers at the Magee Campus in Derry has been reduced from  to  for the   academic year. Records reveal there are  workstations available at Coleraine on a -hour basis in its library. Meanwhile, UU’s Belfast campus has  computers and Jordanstown has  -hour computers with an additional  on offer until pm in its library. The most recent figures show Magee has , students, Coleraine ,, Jordanstown , and Belfast stood at , in   – but will rise dramatically once Jordanstown relocates to the city centre. googletag.cmd.push The % reduction in computers at Magee has been problematic for students with no computer or internet access at home and those in employment who must find time in the evenings and later at night to work on assignments. Ulster University says a decision was taken to reduce the number of -hour computers at Magee based on analysis of out-of-hours usage. However, a number of students studying at the Derry Campus have complained that every time they go to use one of the -hour computers none are available. Vice President of the Students’ Union at Magee, Collette Cassidy, confirmed that she had been made aware of the issue by students and has relayed these concerns to relevant staff at the university with a view to finding a solution. People Before Profit Cllr Shaun Harkin has called on Ulster University to reverse its decision on Magee computer provision. Students at Magee have contacted People Before Profit about the reduction of -hour computer facilities at Magee. They have been cut from  to . This means students cant access computers when they need one and the situation will become much worse during exams. “Anyone who doesnt have a computer at home or who doesnt have access to the internet has been impacted by this, this includes working parents. “No such cut has taken place in Coleraine or Belfast. The Coleraine campus has over  -hour computer facilities. As does Belfast. “Weve just had presentations to Derry and Strabane Council from top Ulster University officials claiming they have a full commitment to expanding Magee. Many people are alarmed Ulster University is set to suck up the bulk of promised City Deal funding. He added: “What sort of message does cutting computer access send to Magee students and people in the North West  It looks like a continuation of the treatment Ulster University and Stormont has dished out to Magee for the last sixty years. “We shouldnt stand for it. We are working with Magee students to demand this decision be reversed immediately. “This also means we have to once again question our trust in Ulster Universitys commitment to Derry and the broader region. “This is why Derry and Strabane Council has agreed to explore all available options when it comes to the development of the type of University we deserve here. This must be followed through on. The Derry University Group added that this confirms everything they have said about Magee being the fourth priority campus of Belfast’s second university. A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: “Computer provision on each campus is reviewed and adapted based on student feedback and demand.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

DUG states: “University provision is necessary to transform this. In the past three decades, Ireland’s other ‘Atlantic Coast’ cities - Cork, Galway and Limerick – have seen their student numbers soar in tandem with their local economies. “Derry Strabane has a total population of ,, with a third-level student population of, at best, ,. “Corkhas a population of , and, with the opening of a new campus in , will have a third-level student population of approximately , – ten times that of the North West. It has an outstanding reputation for its cultural, tourism and recreational facilities.”It says that Derry  Strabane Council’s Strategic Growth Plan is “entirely dependent” on university expansion which doesn’t seem to be forthcoming, with Derry’s student numbers, “already the worst on the island”, dropping again.Cold water has also been poured on Magee expansion by Head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, when he cast doubt over the long-promised Medical School build.Meanwhile, figures published by the Department for the Economyshow , NI students were in higher education in England, Scotland or Wales in  - a ten-year high.And according to the latest statistics, Derry Strabane is the only region of the North that is a net exporter of its young people.“UU has categorically failed to make any progress on its  promise to have , students at Magee by ,” the DUG says. googletag.cmd.push Curriculum Courses at a new independent university must, the group says, offer as broad an academic programme as is practical, reflecting the traditions, strengths and specialisms of the region within its curricula.Therefore, it envisages a full syllabus boasting courses in Medicine, Law, IT, Engineering, Arts, Commerce, but also specialise in and promote courses which are unique to Derry.Long-standing engineering traditions, evident in the City Walls and homegrown engineering companies such as EI, Seagate and InVistashould be reflected.In terms of innovation, Derry currently houses two science parks, conducting research in Articial Intelligence, robotics, virtual augmented reality. “It was the first Irish city to partner with MITto pursue research into D printing, currently running a number of Fab-Labs in schools and communities. “Thousands of people work in IT business support in the North West, with Pramerica employing , people in North Donegal.”There would also be courses in Irish History with Derry being Ireland’s longest continuously inhabited Christian settlement, and the region once home to a number of High Kings in the Middle Ages. These would be complemented by courses in Marine Military History.As a region “bursting with creative talent” Arts, Drama and Music courses are also high on the agenda.The document cites Derry’s reputation as an international leader in modern literature and conflict resolution - with Nobel laureates in both disciplines.Literature  Philosophy, Conflict Resolution  Trauma Relief, Conflict Journalism and Tourism  Heritage are amongst a plethora of subjects synonymous with the city which could be taught at an independent university. Bridging the border The DUG believes there is an urgent need to mitigate against Brexit by ‘bridging the border’ with a new independent university in the North West, recognised and supported by both the Irish EU and British governments, which would have “the freedom and autonomy to serve, andin, both jurisdictions.“Such a facility, centred in Derry, would immediately establish a partnership with the existing Letterkenny Institute of Technology, less than  miles away. The parent university could apply to become a constituent member of both the National University of Ireland and Universities UK. “This would allow it to benefit from both organisations’ administrative expertise. Formal links with southern institutions would, moreover, solidy the European identity of Northern students and, post Brexit, would help protect the rights of Irish citizens in the North as per the Good Friday Agreement.“It is time to renew and regenerate our powerful scholastic legacy. It is time to repudiate the Lockwood Report and correct this historical travesty by immediately establishing a new, independent university.”The Derry University Group has lobbied London, Dublin and US government officials calling for the establishment of a new city-region university. It has made presentations to the Irish government calling for the new university to become a constituent of the National University of Ireland. The group has received official recognition from Derry City and Strabane District Council and the international Derry-Donegal diaspora association Futureproof North West.In , following visits to the North West by the British Labour peer Andrew Adonis and frontbench MPs Mike Amesbury and Mike Kane, Lord Adonis told the Upper House that the decision to deny Derry a standalone university was a “scandal”. He also called for a review of Higher Education provision in the North which has since been published.

DUG states: “University provision is necessary to transform this. In the past three decades, Ireland’s other ‘Atlantic Coast’ cities - Cork, Galway and Limerick – have seen their student numbers soar in tandem with their local economies. “Derry Strabane has a total population of ,, with a third-level student population of, at best, ,. “Corkhas a population of , and, with the opening of a new campus in , will have a third-level student population of approximately , – ten times that of the North West. It has an outstanding reputation for its cultural, tourism and recreational facilities.”It says that Derry  Strabane Council’s Strategic Growth Plan is “entirely dependent” on university expansion which doesn’t seem to be forthcoming, with Derry’s student numbers, “already the worst on the island”, dropping again.Cold water has also been poured on Magee expansion by Head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, when he cast doubt over the long-promised Medical School build.Meanwhile, figures published by the Department for the Economyshow , NI students were in higher education in England, Scotland or Wales in  - a ten-year high.And according to the latest statistics, Derry Strabane is the only region of the North that is a net exporter of its young people.“UU has categorically failed to make any progress on its  promise to have , students at Magee by ,” the DUG says. googletag.cmd.push Curriculum Courses at a new independent university must, the group says, offer as broad an academic programme as is practical, reflecting the traditions, strengths and specialisms of the region within its curricula.Therefore, it envisages a full syllabus boasting courses in Medicine, Law, IT, Engineering, Arts, Commerce, but also specialise in and promote courses which are unique to Derry.Long-standing engineering traditions, evident in the City Walls and homegrown engineering companies such as EI, Seagate and InVistashould be reflected.In terms of innovation, Derry currently houses two science parks, conducting research in Articial Intelligence, robotics, virtual augmented reality. “It was the first Irish city to partner with MITto pursue research into D printing, currently running a number of Fab-Labs in schools and communities. “Thousands of people work in IT business support in the North West, with Pramerica employing , people in North Donegal.”There would also be courses in Irish History with Derry being Ireland’s longest continuously inhabited Christian settlement, and the region once home to a number of High Kings in the Middle Ages. These would be complemented by courses in Marine Military History.As a region “bursting with creative talent” Arts, Drama and Music courses are also high on the agenda.The document cites Derry’s reputation as an international leader in modern literature and conflict resolution - with Nobel laureates in both disciplines.Literature  Philosophy, Conflict Resolution  Trauma Relief, Conflict Journalism and Tourism  Heritage are amongst a plethora of subjects synonymous with the city which could be taught at an independent university. Bridging the border The DUG believes there is an urgent need to mitigate against Brexit by ‘bridging the border’ with a new independent university in the North West, recognised and supported by both the Irish EU and British governments, which would have “the freedom and autonomy to serve, andin, both jurisdictions.“Such a facility, centred in Derry, would immediately establish a partnership with the existing Letterkenny Institute of Technology, less than  miles away. The parent university could apply to become a constituent member of both the National University of Ireland and Universities UK. “This would allow it to benefit from both organisations’ administrative expertise. Formal links with southern institutions would, moreover, solidy the European identity of Northern students and, post Brexit, would help protect the rights of Irish citizens in the North as per the Good Friday Agreement.“It is time to renew and regenerate our powerful scholastic legacy. It is time to repudiate the Lockwood Report and correct this historical travesty by immediately establishing a new, independent university.”The Derry University Group has lobbied London, Dublin and US government officials calling for the establishment of a new city-region university. It has made presentations to the Irish government calling for the new university to become a constituent of the National University of Ireland. The group has received official recognition from Derry City and Strabane District Council and the international Derry-Donegal diaspora association Futureproof North West.In , following visits to the North West by the British Labour peer Andrew Adonis and frontbench MPs Mike Amesbury and Mike Kane, Lord Adonis told the Upper House that the decision to deny Derry a standalone university was a “scandal”. He also called for a review of Higher Education provision in the North which has since been published.

Stephen’s family accepted a request from the College to rename the Year  Class League, which Stephen had been a winning captain of in , in Stephen’s memory.  Presentation of the Shield with Conor Glass, the Quinn family and organiser Mr William McAteer.  The traditional setting of the day of the Halloween holidays has since become Stephen Quinn Shield Final day. As ever this year’s final was a very exciting final, battled out by two teams who had met in the group stages when Pt had come out on top in a high scoring encounter. googletag.cmd.push With the full Year  cohort of pupils giving excellent support Ti opened brightly with Dara O’Kane, Daragh O’Neill and Ruairi Biggs all to the fore. Ryan McGrath was excellent in goals while Danny Mc Goldrick was very solid in defence. Pt though worked their way back in to the game after the early onslaught and as the half wore on they had a lot of play but couldn’t manage to get the crucial scores, despite hitting the woodwork on two occasions and seeing two other goal chances go agonisingly close to the major they needed. Daire Hull, Leon Woods, Jack Rodgers and Corie McKay were proper driving forces for the underdogs while Dara Hassan was excellent in goals but the absence of Padraig O Kane from full back was a huge loss to their team. This was more keenly felt as the underdogs tired through the second-half and it was Ti who finished strongly to send joint captains Dara O’Kane and Daragh O’Neill up to collect the much coveted Stephen Quinn Shield. The Quinn family were present to hand over the Shield and they were joined by another previous winning captain of the event and St Patrick’s legend, Conor Glass, revisiting the St Mary Building while on holidays from his professional career with Hawthorn in Australia. “The College would like to thank the Quinn family for their unwavering support of the event and for being in attendance to do the presentation,” commented Paul Hughes. “Thanks also to Mr William McAteer who organised and ran a fantastic event and to Conor Glass for attending the event. Finally of course a huge well done to all the Year  pupils who took part over many lunch times in the past few weeks.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I am keen to see this Council deliver a benefit from this site to the Waterside community rather than the closed down eyesore it has become.“I have raised this issue with senior Council officials and welcome their response that the future of the site is being progressed.”Cllr Reilly concluded: “I look forward to receiving a more detailed brief from them at committee before the end of the year.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Described by her art teacher, Karen Torley, as someone who ‘paints mainly in acrylics and watercolours but over the last year has grown so much as an artist both in ability and confidence,’ and testament to this is shown by her large Facebook following and the great support she receives from all over the country.“I love painting because it makes me happy and gives me confidence,’ said Tori, as she relaxes in the comfort of her Waterside home among a number of paintings she recently finished for the exhibition,” said Tori.‘I called the exhibition ‘True Colours’ because I like bright colours and love the song since I heard it when it was being used for Autism Awareness.’Looking forward to her daughter’s upcoming exhibitions, mum, Dara, said she has seen Tori change for the better since taking up art. “There has been so many positive benefits since Tori has started to paint and we are so glad that she has found what she truly loves doing. We are all very proud of her,” she said.The budding young artist has many strings to her bow and presently has a work placement once a week in an office under the guidance of Habinteg Housing and is supported by Mencap. The young Waterside woman is also a keen photographer in her spare time.Tori is also been supported by the Foyle Down Syndrome Trust where she presently learns printing skills under their social enterprise programme and she put these skills to good use recently by printing her own posters and invites for the upcoming exhibitions. But it’s art that is still her first love and its where she’s directing all her energy to become and make a career of being a professional artist.Karen Torley, Banyan Theatre and Tori’s art tutor agrees. “Since I started working with Tori three years ago she has grown so much in her talents and confidence. We work together weekly on new paintings but have daily discussions on art and new ideas. Watching her development as an artist gives me so much joy, she is the highlight of my week.”Hoping for a great turnout at the two events, Tori’s mum Dara added: ‘All any parent wants for their children is for them to be happy and she is so happy when she is painting.’Tori’s exhibitions will take place at the Waterside Theatre from Friday, th November and the second will start at the Garden of Reflection on Monday, th November. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

New projects this year included social prescribing mdash helping people who present to their local GP to get out and about in their local area.New investment in multi-disciplinary teams in GP practices in Down was now being rolled out to the rest of Newry and Mourne. He said the Network was central to that roll-out and CDRCNrsquos experience of social prescribing made the organisation a great source of referrals to local community activities.Cllr Casey said CDRCN along with Community Advice and other umbrella support organisations were key to the delivery of Council services. He was grateful to the Network and especially to the hundreds of groups and thousands of volunteers who work away, day and night with no financial reward to make sure this area is a safe, pleasant and prosperous place to live, work and play.Alan Dumigan, CDRCN chairman, thanked the outgoing management committee for their time and expertise in bringing the Network forward.He acknowledged Board member Doris Noe, of Lecale Conservation, who, he said, had contributed her time, energy and expertise over the last number of years to the organisation and he wished her well in her retirement from the board.He thanked the community groups for their ongoing support and the management and staff for their continued commitment.The guest speaker, Dr Chris Leggett, recalled his long association with the community network and the exciting new developments. He acknowledged the importance of projects tackling social isolation and poverty and the need to address mental health and suicide in our local area.Nicholas McCrickard, CDRCN manager, presented the work of the organisation and reported that an increasing range of activities and projects were delivered to a high standard.He thanked the board and staff for a ldquofabulous year and acknowledged that the community and voluntary sector from Bangor to Crossmaglen was a thriving and creative place which was tackling issues relating to health, the economy, the environment and more.ldquoWorking together with the local Councils and Government departments is key to our success, he said. ldquoOur communities have a powerful voice coupled with large numbers of willing volunteers and we have risen to the challenge of tackling mental and physical health problems.The evening concluded with a talk from local photographer Raphael Mason on how photography can impact on peoplersquos physical and mental wellbeing. Attendees were treated to a video collection of captured scenery from around Co Down with collaborations from menrsquos groups..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Ballycran.jpg","title":"Ballycran’s dreams completely crushed by Dunloy demons  ","story":"DUNLOY powered to a comprehensive victory over a game Ballycran side at the Athletic Grounds, Armagh, on Sunday to secure their place in the Ulster Club Senior Hurling Championship final against Slaughtneil.The Antrim kingpins, who recently dethroned Cushendall to get their hands on the Volunteer Cup after a -year lapse, had things very much their own way as they step up their quest for an th Ulster title success.Early scores from Keelan Molloy, Nigel Elliott and Conal Cunning gave Dunloy a - to - lead after only six minutes. Conor Woods got Ballycran moving in the eighth minute with a converted free, but Dunloy responded with two-in-a-row from Elliott and Nicky McKeague to go four points clear.Liam Savage kept Ballycran ticking over with a point from play, but a goal and a point from Cunning eased Dunloy into a - to - lead by the th minute.Woods and Cunning, via a rsquo, swapped points before Liam Savage grabbed his second score of the game in the th minute.Two further Ballycran points from Woods reduced the arrears to four points by the th minute, but Paul Shields and Chris Brogan stretched Dunloyrsquos lead to - to - after  minutes.Woods registered Ballycranrsquos seventh point in the th minute, but Dunloy finished the first half scoring with points from Shields and Cunning as the Antrim side went into the break with a commanding - to - lead.The scores should have been much closer as Ballycran registered six wides in a competitive first half.Woods opened the scoring after the break, but Ballycranrsquos uphill challenge got even harder when Gerard Hughes was given a straight red card, forcing the peninsula side to play the remainder of the game with  men.Cunning and Woods exchanged points before Ryan McGarry, Elliottand Molloy helped Dunloy storm into a - to - lead midway through the second half.A point from Liam Savage slowed Dunloy up for a while, but they quickly regained the initiative and points from Elliott, Eamon Smyth, Cunning and McKeague had the Cuchullains - to - ahead with six minutes remaining.Woods scored a late point for Ballycran, but it was quickly cancelled out by points from Molloy and McKeague and a goal at the death from Anton McGrath to put the game to bed.Ballycran: Stephen Keith, Michael Hughes, Sean Ennis, Gerard Hughes, Brett Nicholson, Padraig Flynn, Patrick Hughes, Liam Savage , Phelim Savage, Scott Nicholson, Conor Woods , Michael Ennis, Stuart Martin, Colum McManus, Chris Egan.

We are being terrorised in our homes and our property is being damaged.Mrs Smyth said it was almost impossible to report incidents to the police.ldquoIf we can get through the police often donrsquot respond, she continued. ldquoThese temporary gates have been being put up for almost two years now. Torn down and put up again. Itrsquos the residents who suffer, not the council people for delays in signing off on the workthat needs to be done.The residents are being supported by local Independent councillor Cadogan Enright, who accused the council of being ldquonot exactly on top of their game.He said: ldquoThe need for fences and gates to make the area into a cul-de-sacs was triggered by an emergency situation where pensioners were and still are under siege by a small number of nersquoer-do-wells, culminating with the actual burning down of a pensionerrsquos cottage.ldquoThe council have not been treating this as an emergency. Were it not for the Housing Executive repeatedly replacing the eight temporary steel and wood barriers week after week when they are torn down, the area would be unviable as an area where pensioners can live.He added: ldquoI have proposed a workshop between the social partners led by the PSNI, Housing Executive, council and other partners to agree in detail a step-by-step process for gating orders in writing so that we never again have such a series of dreadful delays.A spokesman for the council said last night: Newry, Mourne and Down District Council can advise that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has applied to the council for gating orders in the Model Farm area and that the Council is currently following gating order guidance produced by the Department of the Environment.ldquoThis process requires consultation with the Department for Infrastructure and members of the public in the area. A public advertisement of the proposals is then required. It is expected that this process will be complete in December .ldquoThe Policing and Community Safety Partnershiphas increased the number of Community Safety Warden patrols in this area over the last few weeks as a deterrent to reports of anti-social behaviour.ldquoThe PCSP will continue to work in partnership with the PSNI to ensure that warden patrols are appropriately deployed across the Newry, Mourne and Down District Council area where reports of anti-social behaviour have been received..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Fond.jpg","title":"Fond farewell to council chief  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council have bade farewell to their retiring chief executive, Mr Liam Hannaway.The celebratory event, which was hosted by council chairman Charlie Casey took place last Tuesday at Killeavy Castle, near Newry.Paying tribute on the evening, Cllr Casey reflected on Mr Hannawayrsquos many years in public service and his dedication to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.He said: ldquoLiam has spent  years in public service.

We will eventually cover all old estates, subject to continuing funds and satisfactory contracts.Movements have already been made with the awarding of a number of pre-paint repair contracts and work on all contracts should begin by March or April next year.More programmes of maintenance work are being prepared and will be starting in the - financial year, subject to the approval of the Executiversquos Board.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Uncertainty has surrounded the recent proposals to establish units for educationally sub-normal pupils at Castlewellan.The South Eastern Education and Library Board give approval in January for two new units to be set up at the local controlled primary school.However, plans were revised when the neighbouring school, St Malachyrsquos Primary, decided it wanted to have special ESN units.Board officers decided thatan ESN unit is established at St Malachyrsquos the demand for ESN facilities at Castlewellan Primary mightand therefore only one unit might be necessary at each school.But confusion arose when the Board placed advertisements in a local newspaper about the plans to establish the units.Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, was unsure about whether or not the Board had changed its policy and was intended to establish the units at St Malachyrsquos instead of at the controlled school.Mrs Smyth, who has raised the matter on several occasions, told Board members, this week that she was aggrieved about the whole affair and thought that Board officers had acted in a ldquovery surreptitious manner.ldquoThis sort of thing raises suspicions in the community and itrsquos just not good enough,: said Mrs Smyth.However, she was assured by Board chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, that Board officers had not acted in an underhand manner and that there had only been a misunderstanding.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh priest had called this week for people to follow the example of friendship shown by more than  Protestants and Roman Catholics who joined together in a special Halloween dinner and concert organised by his church.He is Fr Hugh OrsquoHagan and he was speaking hours after  senior citizens had enjoyed a dinner and concert in St Maryrsquos Hall, organised by the hall management committee.Speaking afterwards Fr OrsquoHagan said that Killyleagh and Shrigley had a unique community, ldquo everywhere has like here, Northern Ireland would be a more peaceful place.Invitations to Thursdayrsquos dinner and concert went out to both sides of the community and Fr OrsquoHagan stressed that he hoped no senior citizen had been forgotten, either Protestant or Roman Catholic.The idea of the dinner mdash which was such a success last year, when he was held for the first time mdash has been widely praised in the town, especially by the senior citizens and Thursday nightrsquos was no exception, with many voting it a big hit.Before the dinner began, Fr OrsquoHagan mdash who has been priest in Killyleagh for over  years and who is the longest serving priest ever in the town mdash welcomed everyone and thanked them for coming.He welcomed especially, the three ministers in the town, the Rev J C Boggs, Rev J D Mark and Rev R E Conn.

preparing to import the generic drug from South America as part of a CF Buyers Club of families.In a desperate attempt to start their son on the drug as quickly as possible, the couple and their family fundraised around pound, to buy Lorcaacuten three months treatment.ldquoWe were so close to getting the generic drug ourselves and that would have been great as Lorcaacuten would have started on it, but we would have still been campaigning and pushing for it, said Jen.ldquoWe have been told that the Department of Health want to copy what NHS England did and get the drug into peoplersquos

The choral society gave me a taste for musical theatre and my mum really pushed me to do it. It turned out that I just loved it, added the former pupil of St Colmcillersquos High School in Crossgar and Down High School, Downpatrick.Mark performed in every musical staged by the society until his final appearance in Sunset Bouled, with music from Andrew Lloyd Webber, at the Grand Opera House in .ldquoThat role was the hardest one I had ever done, as while I have had plenty of leading roles, it was one that had me on stage in a major theatre and for nearly every scene, just as I will have to do the same in Joseph, said Mark.While Declanrsquos illness undoubtedly shook the McMullan family to its core, Mark said that he believes some good has come out of it.ldquoBefore Declan took sick in , my dream was always to go and live and work in London and do musical theatre. Unfortunately when that happened I had to put that dream on hold.ldquoI never thought I would look at it again as I knew I had to help Declan and my family, but unwittingly, the bad thing that happened to Declan has actually helped me pursue that dream even more.ldquoHe is my biggest supporter, hersquos like my manager.

Leading a presentation on Agriculture and Agri-food, Craig Humes highlighted how dairy farmers will be one of the main farming groups to be ldquostruck by Brexit.ldquo. billion litres of milk are collected from across Northern Irish farms each year.  per cent of this milk produced is then exported south to be processed.ldquoThis could make le extremely dficult for farmersexport tarfs are to be introduced, Craig shared, adding that Dr. Mike Johnston, Chief Executive of the Dairy Council Northern Ireland believes that milk prices could drop by  pence per litre should a no-deal Brexit proceed with such excessive tarfs announced.ldquoIn my opinion, to put it quite simply, dairy farmers will not survive in Fermanagh unless there is a deal, commented Craig.In her presentation on Tourism and Hospitality Rebekah Starrett noted how Fermanagh had over , visitors last year who spent an average of pound. million.ldquoThis is a massive amount of money being spent in this local economy. The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things. Brexit has taught me the importance of ensuring that my opinion and voice is heard, especially, when I wasnrsquot the age to vote in the  referendum.ldquoWhilst much of what happens around Brexit is beyond our control one thing for sure is that the potential impact will affect all of our lives.

McDonald, flanked by North Belfast candidate John Finucane and party vice president Michelle ONeill, speaks to the media outside Sinn Feins offices on Falls Road in Belfast, as she announces her partys decision to stand aside in three constituencies in Northern Ireland. Announcing the move in Belfast, party president Mary Lou McDonald also urged voters to back the SDLPs Claire Hanna in South Belfast and Alliance Party leader Naomi Long in East Belfast.The move came hours after the SDLP announced it would stand aside in three seats as well, again to facilitate Remainers in their efforts to beat DUP candidates..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The nationalist party will not put forward candidates in North and East Belfast and North Down.The move in North Belfast will give Sinn Fein candidate John Finucane a better chance of unseating DUP deputy leader and long-standing MP Nigel Dodds, who has a majority of just over ,.Outlining Sinn Feins decision on Monday afternoon, Ms McDonald said: \"In many ways this is a once-in-a-generation election, the stakes are very high in this election.\"People have a fundamental choice to make - to vote for a positive, inclusive future or to turn their backs on that and to back candidates who have been the architects of Brexit and who have acted very, very deliberately against the democratic wishes of people here in the north and more fundamentally against the economic and social interests of citizens who live here.\"She added: \"The reality is we are asking people to come out and vote for those pro-Remain candidates. We believe that is the right and progressive thing to do.\"Ms McDonald said it sat comfortably with her to urge Sinn Fein supporters to vote for a unionist.\"It sits very comfortably with me to ask and invite voters to thoughtfully do the right thing,\" she said.\"And in this case it means defying hard Brexiteers, the likes of Nigel Dodds, the likes of the DUP candidates who have very, very recklessly acted against the interests of everybody.\"Whether you call yourself a unionist or a nationalist, a republican or a loyalist, we actually have many, many interests in common.\"Steve Aiken U-turns to back unionist unity,  days after ruling it out Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The SDLP decision not to field a candidate in North Belfast for the first time in the partys history has prompted claims of hypocrisy from political rivals, given the SDLPs vocal criticism of Sinn Feins Westminster abstentionist policy in other battleground constituencies, such as Foyle.Former SDLP councillor Mairia Cahill resigned from the party in protest at the move, accusing the party of facilitating a \"sectarian headcount\".The SDLP said it had taken an \"extraordinary decision\" for an \"extraordinary election\".\"We have taken a unilateral decision not to stand candidates in North Down, North Belfast and East Belfast,\" said the party.\"Our first priority is to elect pro-Remain MPs to vote against Brexit and Boris Johnson but removing pro-Brexit MPs in Belfast is also critical.\"The Ulster Unionist Party has already stepped aside in North Belfast to give Mr Dodds a better chance of winning.The UUP decision also proved controversial, as it came only a week after incoming leader Steve Aiken pledged to run in all  constituencies in Northern Ireland. He has been accused of a major U-turn before he has even been officially elected as leader.Police are investigating alleged paramilitary threats made to the party in the wake of Mr Aikens initial pledge.The absence of SDLP and Sinn Fein candidates in East Belfast is designed to give Ms Long a better chance of defeating incumbent DUP MP Gavin Robinson, while in North Down the parties hope independent unionist and pro-Remain MP Lady Sylvia can see off a DUP challenge.Sinn Feins standing aside in South Belfast will strengthen SDLP candidate Ms Hannas chance of beating sitting DUP MP Emma Little-Pengelly.At the weekend the DUP announced it would continue its recent policy of not contesting Fermanagh and South Tyrone - a move that will assist an Ulster Unionist candidate in efforts to unseat Sinn Fein MP Michelle Gildernew.The cross-community Alliance Party has made clear it has no role in the electoral manoeuvres and will not engage in any pacts.try catch  TrendingCounsellors brought into NI school to help pupils after teen killed and four others hospitalised in horror crashMother tells of agony after sons body found -

The South Antrim MLA bluntly and emphatically replied: “No. We’re not standing aside. We’re going to fight all  constituencies.”Askedhe would regret his decision to run  candidatesit was to cost someone like Nigel Dodds his seat, Mr Aiken said: “Nigel Dodds and the DUP made it very clear, time and time again, that they don’t need Ulster Unionist support and we didn’t put a border down the Irish Sea Nigel Dodds needs to answer that question.”He went on to set out his reasoning for such a stance, arguing that the DUP had undermined the Union both through its involvement in ious scandals and its handling of Brexit, and said that the UUP would offer an alternative of either a very soft Brexit or cancelling Brexit entirely, which he said would not be as damaging to the Union.However, by yesterday Mr Aiken outlined a policy diametrically opposed to that which he had initially said he believed in.In a statement, he referred to what he said was the DUP’s responsibility for the Brexit “debacle” which “cannot be whitewashed away”.Denouncing the party for which he is urging north Belfast unionists to vote, he went on: “It was their acceptance of a regulatory border in the Irish Sea on October , vigorously opposed by the Ulster Unionist Party, which opened the floodgates for Boris Johnson and his dreadful deal.Naomi Long to stand again in East Belfast at general election Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The Union itself is now in a precarious position not in spite of the DUP’s stance but because of the DUP’s actions.”Mr Aiken said that he had been in discussions with “senior political and community figures across north Belfast” and had “listened respectfully to all views expressed, including deeply held concerns that they will be unrepresented in Westminster in the critical months ahead”.He went on: “This has been done in the context of threats and intimidation against UUP staff and members. In a modern democracy no-one should have to face threats, intimidation or coercion of any sort because of their involvement in the democratic process.“It is appalling and totally reprehensible and should have no place in Northern Ireland in the st century.”He said it was “absolutely vital that MPs are ed who will take their seats and be able to influence the future direction of our nation” and “therefore we have decided not to nominate a candidate in North Belfast in the forthcoming election.“The DUP recognise that they cannot win North Belfast on their own, despite having dismissed the opinions of other unionists in the past. They cannot expect to continue on that basis and must now realise they need Ulster Unionist voices at Westminster.“The choice in North Belfast is between Nigel Dodds as MP or an abstentionist MP who refuses to stand in Westminster to talk about health, education, justice, international affairs, or the future direction of the United Kingdom.“In the face of Boris Johnson’s terrible deal which forces Northern Ireland towards the edge of the Union, we cannot gt a seat to Sinn Fein who support this direction either in North Belfast or Fermanagh and South Tyrone.“It is better to elect Nigel Dodds in North Belfast and hold him to account for his promises on the Union than facilitate the election of an abstentionist Sinn Fein MP who still cannot condemn IRA violence.”On Saturday, DUP leader Arlene Foster announced that the DUP would not stand against Tom Elliott in Fermanagh-South Tyrone, saying that voters “deserve to be represented in the House of Commons rather than an absentee MP standing on the sidelines”.Howver, Mr Elliott told the Press Association that he was not prepared to confirmhe plans to run as a candidate ahead of a selection meeting on Thursday.DUP leader Arlene Foster – who Steve Aiken has derided as “two borders Foster” – was quick to endorse the UUP decision.The former first minister said: “We welcome the fact that the Ulster Unionists have reached this decision.“They know that they cannot win in North Belfast and that first class representation is already provided by Nigel Dodds. I have a strong sense that unionism across Northern Ireland wants to see unionist parties working together for the Union.”Alliance, which over recent years has continued to stand candidates inareas where it faced physical attacks, including a constituency office which was torched, said that “paramilitaries cannot be allowed to win”.The party’s North Belfast candidate, Nuala McAllister, said: “This backtracking by Steve Aiken is not only him caving in but also effectively bowing the knee to the DUP before he has even taken the reins of the UUP. He made a big play about running candidates in every constituency but has now lost any credibility he had.”Sinn Fein’s North Belfast candidate, John Finucane, has appealed to unionists opposed to Brexit to vote for him, saying that unionists who oppose leaving the EU “are not represented by Nigel Dodds, one of the chief architects of the Tory Brexit”. He said: “With the UUP withdrawing from this contest under pressure from loyalist paramilitaries, there is now no unionist candidate representing those who voted to remain in Europe.”The TUV had called for unionist unity in seats where Sinn Fein could otherwise benefit, saying that it would be “folly to gt seats to Sinn Fein” and that “any party that sets such a course is not serving the Union”. The PUP leader Billy Hutchinson had also called for a single unionist candidate.Just hours before Mr Aiken reversed his policy, former UUP leader Mike Nesbitt had warned that it would be “nothing short of hypocrisy” for his party to sign up to an electoral pact with the DUP.Speaking on Newstalk Breakfast, the Strangford MLA said that the election was a chance for unionists to voice anger at the DUP’s behaviour.He said: “Since the last election, the DUP have been embroiled in a sort of alphabet soup of scandals – both corporately with the likes of RHI and inidually with Ian Paisley Jr.“And also their stance on Brexit, I think, is an existential threat to the future of the United Kingdom.“So it is very dficult to be making those sort of criticisms of a party and then to go into the ballot box on the th of December coming and give them one of their preferences. That is nothing short in my analysis of hypocrisy.”He said the pressure coming from the DUP was “frankly undemocratic”.He added: “I mean, they are criticising us for saying we want to run candidates in a political election. If it is a democracy, we are entitled to run in all  constituencies.”try catch  TrendingCounsellors brought into NI school to help pupils after teen killed and four others hospitalised in horror crashMother tells of agony after sons body found -

Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done.

However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their sole motive has been about blocking Brexit.I have long thought the only way out of this is a general election.The British people need to be given the opportunity to have a clear out of those politicians who said one thing to get elected and have done another in office.All Labour and Conservative MPs were elected on manestos explicitly promising to respect and honour the referendum result.The people of Penarth deserve better than this.Earlier this month, I was present on the steps of the Senedd as the petition to save the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital was presented to the Assembly.I joined other local representatives and campaigners from Unison to receive the petition, and send a clear message on the health boardrsquos proposals.Under the plans, the -bed older persons rehabilitation ward will close, with services transferring either to the community or Llandough Hospital.Local opinion in Barry is quite clear that the ward should stay, while in Llandough, further expansion of the hospital will cause further pressures on the village.You wonrsquot often catch me standing alongside Unison, but on this we completely agree.These plans need to be dropped.The Royal British Legion have officially launched the  Poppy Appeal, and as ever, I am delighted to pledge my support.It is crucial we commemorate those who made the ultimate sacrice to defend our freedoms, including those from Penarth.Wearing a poppy is an understated yet clear way of demonstrating that, and it also raises vital funds to support current and former servicemen and women and their families.It is often misunderstood as condoning or celebrating war, and that could not be further from the truth. It is respecting those who have fallen.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Royal British Legion for their work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged.

ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre.

We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business.
