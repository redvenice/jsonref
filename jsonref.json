And yet you did it anyway. #perpwalk,\u0027 he tweeted in May.Bourdain, 61, and Argento met during the filming of his travel show Parts Unknown in 2016 and began dating a year later. Shortly before he was found hanged in his French hotel room, a paparazzi caught Argento dancing in a Roman restaurant with French reporter Hugo Clément.

He studied photography at Ealing Technical College before becoming a freelance photographer for black British newspapers like West Indian World          Untitled, from the series The Black House, 1973-1976, by Colin Jones. Jones photographed these men as part of a project on the Harambee project in Islington. The housing project for young black people was located in north London, on the Holloway Road. Many of the young men who lived in the house were said to be fascinated by the Black Power movement, with Jones trying to create intimate portraits of the iniduals    Untitled, from the series The Black House, 1973-1976, by Colin Jones. Jones was commissioned in 1973 by the Sunday Times  to produce illustrations for an article by the journalist Peter Gillman on the Harambee project in Islington, titled ‘On the Edge of the Ghetto.’ The hostel was a government-funded housing project which aimed to provide support for disillusioned black adolescents who experienced prejudice, unemployment and problems with the law          Young Gun, Hackney, London, 1969, by Dennis Morris.  This striking image was taken by the Jamacan-born photographer when he was just nine years old. He learnt about photography in North London at a club run by Donald Paterson, a wealthy and philanthropic man, and most of the people who appear in his pictures came from the same area.  Morris is also known for his music photography including pictures taken of the Sex Pistols          Fashion Shoot, Brixton Market, London, 1973, by Armet Francis. Armet Francis was born in Jamaica in 1945 and was ten years old when he left for Britain.

Francis was interested in representations of the black Diaspora on a global scale, and returned to Jamaica in 1969 to start a cross-cultural project entitled The Black Triangle, photographing black communities in Britain, Africa, and the Caribbean. His work is shown at the Tate, Museum of London and Victoria \u0026amp Albert Museum          Untitled, from the series The Black House, 1973-1976, by Colin Jones. In the early 1970s the name ‘Black House’ became associated in the public consciousness as the lair of infamous con artist and murderer Michael de Freitas (also known as ‘Michael X’).

Jones bought his first camera running an errand for ballerina Dame Margot Fonteyn in Japan          Untitled, East End, London, 1970s, by Tex Ajetunmobi. Bandele Ajetunmobi – known as ‘Tex’ –was  born in Nigeria in 1921.

We\u0027re family, we look after each other. I can tell you now they will not speak.

He went back to his cabin and left her. The next thing he knew he was woken by the crew to say they thought she was missing as they had found her belongings.\u0027By this point a search was being carried out by the crew and the ship doubled back and carried out at least four passes. The coastguard then took over, and the ship went on to Venice.Doubts have been cast on Miss Longstaff\u0027s claim that she fell from the liner.The captain of the ship said she was a \u0027jumper\u0027 while the director of a trade organisation representing over 50 cruise companies said it was unheard of for anyone acting \u0027 responsibly\u0027 falling off a ship.Other passengers on the week long cruise around the Greek islands claimed the couple had been arguing and drinking prior to Longstaff going over the side.After spending a night in hospital in the Croatian port of Pula she was discharged and driven to Venice at her pre booked hotel.Medical staff in Pula said Longstaff had mild hypothermia symptoms but was otherwise in good condition despite spending 10 hours in the water.Survival experts said the relatively warm temperature of the sea and lack of wind to churn up the waves helped in her survival.Miss Longstaff remained hidden away in her hotel room and told staff not to put any calls through.  Air stewardess almost drowned - because rescue plane couldn\u0027t see her frantic wavingThe British woman who spent ten hours in the sea after going overboard from a cruise ship was forced to watch a rescue plane circle above for up to two hours before being saved, it was revealed yesterday.The captain of the boat that rescued Kay Longstaff said she was probably not seen from the air because she was not in a life jacket and was only just above the water.Lovro Oreskovic, commander of the coastguard patrol boat Cavtat, also said it took his crew \u0027just five minutes\u0027 to find her after they arrived in the area where she was reported to have gone overboard from the Norwegian Star.He claimed her miraculous survival was a rebirth, adding: \u0027We wish her all the best in her new life.      Ms Longstaff posted Facebook pictures of herself during the cruise including when the vessel docked off the Greek island of Santorini (pictured) last week          Another of her holiday snaps posted on Facebook shows the Norwegian Star near shore during the Mediterranean cruise last week \u0027She was very happy, very relieved and very grateful when we found her. The first thing she said to us when she came on board was, \u0027You saved my life! You saved my life!\u0027.\u0027She was in shock and dehydrated. She was very red and her skin was wrinkled from being so long in the water. We gave her water and she was checked by our medical team. She was also hungry so we gave her some vegetable soup and a chocolate mousse. She also had an isotonic energy drink and some fresh orange juice.\u0027He said a crew member lent her a T-shirt and a pair of trousers so she had dry clothes to wear.She slept for about an hour on a sofa as the ship returned to shore.  By then, her shorts had dried and she changed back in to them.Last night, questions continued to be asked about exactly what had happened when Miss Longstaff, who lives on the Costa del Sol in Spain, tumbled from the cruise liner shortly before midnight on Saturday, off northern Croatia, around 60 miles south of Pula.She has been accused of causing huge disruption to passengers, and costing Norwegian Cruise Line hundreds of thousands of pounds for delays caused by the incident.Lawyer Jim Fisher, an expert in cruise ship accidents, said 80 per cent of incidents of people going overboard from cruise liners were linked to alcohol, while 5 per cent were trying to take their lives.Andy Harmer, director of the Cruise Lines International Association industry body, said: \u0027Cruise ships today are the safest that ever sailed thanks to the rules and technological innovations that govern their design. There are no known cases of someone acting responsibly who has accidentally fallen over the railing of a cruise ship.\u0027 He said safety regulations included uniform minimum railing and balcony heights of 1m, plus other structural barriers to prevent passengers falling off a ship.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/21/22/4F482C8B00000578-0-image-m-25_1534885358642.jpg","title":"Welsh actor Taron Egerton pictured playing Elton John new film singers journey stardom","story":"    Welsh actor Taron Egerton, 28, playing iconic rock star Elton John in the biopic \u0027Rocketman\u0027          Elton John on \u0027The Muppet Show\u0027.

Last year two people were arrested on charges of sexual assault.  Unlike more traditional music festivals, Burning Man organizers are tasked with teaching Burners that freedom on the playa doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s a free for all.          The issue of sexual harassment at festivals have finally come to light with the rising movement, and  organizers must teach Burners that the festival\u0027s free spirit doesn\u0027t mean a free for all\u0027Just because we aim to be sexually liberated doesn\u0027t mean we are,\u0027 Donna Rae Watson told the Reno Gazette-Journal.  \u0027In the Burn community, you run into this attitude where we welcome the stranger, but sometimes that translates into: We have to accept their behavior. That\u0027s not how it should be.\u0027 Watson is the director of the Bureau of Erotic Discourse, a camp on the playa with the sole purpose of teaching Burners about consensual sex.  \u0027We\u0027re an experimental community, but we still bring the problems from the default world into the burn,\u0027 she said.  \u0027Our sole purpose is to bring consent front and center and incorporate it into the ethos of the culture, where boundaries are respected and our bodies are respected.\u0027\u0027We\u0027re taught the basics of consent in first grade: Don’t touch people without their consent, but we fail to extrapolate that to the sexual arena. We aim to fill that gap\u0027 That includes teaching Burners that scandalous costumes and nudity should not be considered an all-inclusive invitation.       Burning Man organizers are now also getting involved, this year sending attendees an email reminding them about the importance of consent for sex, touch, or photosAnd then there is Vika Viktoria, who hosts underground men\u0027s salons in order to help male Burners get in touch with different ideas surrounding masculinity. \u0027The men were immediately more fearless, there was an understanding that everyone there was curious and they wanted to be better,\u0027 she said. \u0027In the default world, there are several defenses that need to come down to get to that same crux of curiosity.\u0027 But not everyone is ecstatic about the changes on the playa.Ted Allen, who runs the Hug Church, has seen a sense of trust disappear since he first came to the festival 13 years ago.           B.E.D is now no longer the only camp on the playa that is working to preach consensual sex, while others are forming to give women their own safe space entirelyAllen said that he now offers a handshake before giving out hugs as a way of asking for consent. \u0027This is not a handshake culture, this is not a handshake society,\u0027 he said. \u0027You can get that anywhere else.

There have been four official sightings this year of the Loch Ness Monster\u0027There is clearly a solid object in it and it is relatively clear.

Congratulations Charlotte. I am totally excited by it.\u0027There have been four official sightings this year of the Loch Ness Monster.The last previous glimpse of Nessie occurred on August 5 at 9.38am when the family, regular visitors to the area, were on holiday - also from Leeds.It has now been accepted by the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings\u0027 Register.\u0027After travelling from Drumnadrochit to Fort Augustus they looked out at the loch and spotted a strange looking lump on the surface of the water, which was very still and quiet at the time,\u0027 said the register.\u0027It looked dark brown in colour and \u0027sort of like an upturned boat\u0027. They revisited the area by boat in the afternoon and there was nothing like that in that area. Unfortunately because they were driving and couldn\u0027t pull in, they didn\u0027t manage to get any pictures.\u0027In June the first sighting of the Loch Ness Monster in moonlight was recorded - and in front of an 11-year-old girl.The third sighting of the year of the legendary monster was also accepted by the official Nessie register.Natalie Hodgson and her family, on holiday from Yorkshire, took a picture of the head of an unknown creature in the water at 10.30pm on June 1 from the Highland Lodges holiday park where they were staying. The creature remained for a few minutes caught in the moonlight before disappearing.It follows a \u0027remarkable, feature film length\u0027 video of the Loch Ness Monster shot by a Nessie watcher from Ireland on April 30.Hospital clerical worker Eoin O\u0027Faodhagain from Donegal took a ten minute video from the Loch Ness webcam.The creature moves from right to left and as it swam towards Urquhart Bay - a favourite haunt of Nessie - and is seen ing and surfacing with water splashes.DNA sampling recently took place to discover previously unrecorded organisms in Loch Ness.                             I am totally excited by this photograph - it is the best of \u0027Nessie\u0027 in years                        However Prof Neil Gemmell, a New Zealand scientist leading the project, said he did not believe in Nessie, but was confident of finding genetic codes for other creatures.Prof Gemmell of New Zealand\u0027s University of Otago said a \u0027biological explanation\u0027 might be found to explain some of the stories about the Loch Ness Monster.He said: \u0027Wouldn\u0027t it be amazing if we did find something extraordinary during our investigation.\u0027Is there anything else, perhaps something unusual, such as a giant catfish, sturgeon or eel, or a species unknown to science? It seems unlikely, but who knows?\u0027Results of the project are expected in early 2019.Sightings of the Loch Ness Monster set new global records last year.Nessie\u0027s 11 accepted sightings in 2017 were the highest this century.According to Google, there are around 200,000 searches each month for the Loch Ness Monster, and around 120,000 for information and accommodation close to Loch Ness. The monster mystery is said to be worth £30m to the region.Irish missionary St Columba is first said to have encountered a beast in the River Ness in 565AD. Since then there have been 1080 officially logged sightings.Among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in 1934 by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson.The image was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed that the pictures were staged.The Home Office last year rejected a cheeky bid by a group of artists from Glasgow to grant the Loch Ness Monster permanent UK residency after Brexit. "},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb578fe43114d16e3a73727fa9b0a48a54ff4535/0_494_3639_2183/master/3639.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aac2c142a45f7b01bfc2de4768b5291c","title":"back to the futuro house flying saucer matti suuronen","story":"Dreamed up in Finland and shaped like a flying saucer, Matti Suuronen’s ‘house of the future’ turned out to be an impractical curio – but its atomic-age aesthetics are still alluringLike jetpacks, flying cars and robot butlers, the Futuro was supposed to revolutionise the way we lived. Unlike those other staples of an imagined future, however, this architectural oddity actually existed. A colourful pod in the shape of an ellipse, the Futuro was a sci-fi vision of the future, offering us a living space light years away from what most of us were used to. Nicknamed the Flying Saucer and the UFO House, it was symbolic of the ambitious space-race era. But as the Futuro celebrates its 50th anniversary, the revolution it promised clearly never happened. Aficionados estimate that of the 100 or so made, only 68½ (more on the half later) remain.One belongs to Craig Barnes, an artist based in London, who saw a Futuro in a “dishevelled and tired” state while on holiday in Port Alfred, South Africa. He decided to mount a rescue mission. “I have family out there,” he says, “and I’d been seeing this Futuro since I was about three. I viewed it as a spaceship. I drove past in 2013 and workers were knocking down a garage next to it. I panicked and managed to trace the owner.”Barnes learned of plans to relocate the Futuro to the grounds of a guesthouse, where inflatable green “aliens” would be installed and dry ice pumped from underneath. “I thought it was ungracious to treat an old lady in such a fashion and, over five insane days, bought it, had it dismantled and arranged for it to be shipped to the UK.”The Futuro looked as if it came from outer space, but actually it was from outer Finland. It was designed by a Matti Suuronen, an architect and keen volleyball player who was part of Finland’s national league. “He had been commissioned by a childhood friend to design a cabin on a ski slope,” says his daughter Sari. “The family needed a place on the steep hill where they could stay for the weekend, warm up and have some meals.”The cabin housed eight people and was held aloft by steel legs. The curved shape meant snow couldn’t settle. It had fixed seats, a kitchen, bathroom, bedrooms and a central table. Cooking was done using a portable “fire box”. And, because it measured a mere eight metres across, the pod could be transported on a flat-bed lorry or hoisted into position by helicopter.Suuronen pioneered the use of reinforced plastic and manmade materials such as polyester resin, fibreglass and acrylic. Another of his creations was a petrol station in Lempäälä, south-west Finland, made principally from plastic. Motorists often took lengthy detours to visit it.Born in 1933, Suuronen claimed the Futuro was purely an application of mathematics, but many believe he was influenced – perhaps subliminally – by science fiction. Flying saucers had emerged in the late 1920s, brilliantly imagined and drawn in American pulp magazines such as Amazing Stories and Science Wonder Stories. By the 50s, they often featured in films, among them The Day the Earth Stood Still, Forbidden Planet and Earth vs the Flying Saucers.The first exemplar of space-age architecture is thought to be the House of the Future, installed at Disneyland, California, in 1957. Designers were asked to imagine how housing might look 30 years hence. The fibreglass structure was set on a pedestal and had four symmetrical wings. More than 20 million people visited during the 10 years it was standing. But the architect chiefly associated with atomic-age houses is John Lautner. His most famous work, the Chemosphere, was built in 1960, overlooking San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles. A one-storey octagon, it is perched on a nine-metre concrete pole and reached by funicular. Its current owner is Benedikt Taschen, founder of the eponymous German publishing house and, significantly, a comic-book fanatic.While Lautner and others indulged wealthy patrons and corporate sponsors, Suuronen had a more homespun, utilitarian vision for the Futuro. He based his company in Espoo, a city near Helsinki, most famous for being the home of the Finnish Museum of Horology – and for spawning the death metal band Children of Bodom, frequent toppers of the country’s album chart.Suuronen designed his own family’s home and lived there with his wife, Sirkku, a professional pianist, and their three children. His eye for detail was such that he could read technical plans upside-down. Even at their busiest, Suuronen did not employ more than a dozen people and each started work at 10am, thanks to the boss’s fondness for a lie-in.In 1968, the Futuro was displayed at the Finfocus export fair in London, positioned on the upper deck of a ferry moored on the Thames. More than 400 enquiries were logged and media interest was high. On 20 July 1969, the day Apollo 11 landed on the moon, the New York Times carried a piece with the headline: “Saucer-shaped house arrives on Earth.”A licence to manufacture the Futuro was granted to around 30 companies throughout the world. The sole UK recipient was Waterside Plastics, in the mill town of Todmorden, West Yorkshire. The company had evolved from Fielden Brothers, a major textile concern run to a benevolent ethos. Almost 2,000 people had once been employed in 11 of its mills. The commitment to the Futuro (and to similar projects such as “Sharky the unsinkable sloop”) was a gallant but doomed attempt to leave a legacy. The company folded in 1979.The surroundings in Todmorden – all narrow, sooty streets and factories chiselled into the steep Pennines – could not have been more incongruous. The town’s mayor, Donald Rigg, arranged for a prototype of the house (the only Futuro ever manufactured in the UK) to feature in the 75th anniversary of Todmorden’s borough charter, in 1971. That summer, it was mounted on land outside a medical centre and used as a ticket office for celebratory events. Hundreds turned out to see it paraded through the streets by lorry and then put in place by crane. It looked as if the locals had captured a spaceship.The first Futuro installed as a bona fide residence was at Lake Puula, near Espoo. Futura 001 was purchased as a summer home by Finnish comedy actor Matti Kuusla. Locals said it was out of place in a rural environment. This pattern was repeated elsewhere, especially in the US, where permission to erect them was often refused. Banks were reluctant to provide finance and then the 1973 oil crisis, which saw prices quadruple, effectively ended the Futuro experiment. Plastic had been viewed as an inexpensive building material but oil is required in its production, and costs for the house rose prohibitively. In a few short years, the Futuro had become a curiosity rather than a force for revolution.While many of the 100 or so Futuros made have been destroyed or vandalised, others have found new lives – as restaurants, children’s play rooms, targets for shooting practice and a dog kennel. One even ended up as a VIP room at 2001 Odyssey, a strip club in Tampa Bay, Florida. “Say ‘spaceship’ at the door for free entry,” reads its sign. Several are exhibited in museums and a building in Frankfurt has half a Futuro (it was sliced in two) bolted to its side.Suuronen spent his final years short of money. “He was too kind and blue-eyed to be a businessman,” says Sari. “He did not know how to take advantage of the fame of Futuro, to make money out of it. He had many health issues and didn’t have the energy to pursue more designing contracts. A recession in the 1990s slowed construction in Finland. He was also too slow to lay off his personnel and he used up my mother’s inheritance. The bank took their house and sold it at auction for very little money. So they lost everything.’’Suuronen died in 2013, aged 79. He had cancer, as well as heart and respiratory problems. “He was always very optimistic about his health,” says Sari. “He played volleyball up until his last operation. He never lost his vivid, creative mind and his lust for creating something more for the world.”Meanwhile, after years of hard work and at great expense, Barnes has renovated the Futuro he bought in South Africa. The spherical house was exhibited in London on the roof of Matt’s Gallery and installed at Central Saint Martins, then shipped to Le Havre, northern France, for the city’s summer festival this year. “The Futuro shouldn’t be viewed as a flawed and failed utopian ideal,” says Barnes. “It’s a wonderful space to bounce around ideas. Everything about it is a celebration of the imagination.”The patent for the Futuro, meanwhile, has remained with the Suuronen family. The house of the future may yet return."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/3220d4fd71b80196aeeecf95890da419401f50ea/41_52_2845_1707/master/2845.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28ab4346096edc9ec233b0f23b40e487","title":"black britain in the 1970s autograph in pictures","story":"From the archive of arts agency Autograph, these photos depict the lives of black Britons, from sound systems to strident politics "},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/efbe8ecebfca4d3c5c3a9d80b71480b60fcf970d/0_112_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60b4def7a16cc318d55e5d334b433106","title":"bank report reopens debate on scrapping 1p and 2p coins","story":"Bank of England report says withdrawal of coppers would have no significant impact on pricesBank of England economists have reignited the debate over the future of 1p and 2p coins, arguing their removal from circulation would not stoke inflation.In a blog post on Wednesday the analysts said their work and the “overwhelming” evidence suggested the withdrawal of coppers would have “no significant impact on prices”.The authors – Marilena Angeli and Jack Meaning – dismissed the argument that scrapping the coins would be inflationary as retailers moved to round up prices.“Price rounding would be applied at the total bill level, not on inidual items and it would only affect cash transactions, which make up a low proportion of spending by value. “Even if inidual prices were rounded on all payments, analysis of UK price data suggests no economically significant impact on inflation.”They pointed to the sharp decline in the use of coppers as as consumers increasingly shun cash in favour of contactless payments. This is reflected in the Royal Mint’s production of 1p and 2p coins which roughly halved in 2016-17 compared with the previous year. Production of pennies fell from around 500m, to 288m.It is not the first time the future of the 1p and 2p coins has been questioned. At the time of the chancellor’s spring statement in March, the Treasury launched a review of cash and digital payments, and said it did not make economic sense to produce coins that were used infrequently.However, a day after the review was announced, Downing Street said it had no plans to axe 1p and 2p coins after a brief but determined media campaign and concerns raised by charities.As the  revealed last year, George Osborne came close to abolishing 1p and 2p coins when he was chancellor, but the idea was blocked by the prime minister, David Cameron, who thought the public might disapprove.Returning to the debate on Wednesday, the Bank of England economists called into question the cost effectiveness of continuing to produce the coins.“As inflation slowly erodes the purchasing power of the penny, the balance between its usefulness and its cost begins to shift,” they argued.Angeli and Meaning said history suggested that scrapping low denomination coins did not stoke inflation, citing the abolition of the halfpenny in 1984.“Many of the arguments that were made in the early 1980s around the inflationary impact of removing that particular tiny coin are being made now. However, the evidence, including our own work on UK price data suggests they are unfounded,” the authors wrote."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcd725010cbd60d6a5a7e49538eb49eed2c20151/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ea8d96b1385f475d9941277c39d06d0","title":"wall street record longest rally history bull market","story":"Tax cuts, QE, low inflation and tech profits push key S\u0026ampP 500 index towards 3,453 days without major correctionThe US stock market is poised to break the record for the longest rally ever, setting a landmark in the near decade long Wall Street boom that has gathered pace over the course of this year.One theory explaining the stock market terminology comes from the way both animals attack their opponents. A bull thrusts its horns up into the air, while a bear swipes downward.The previous record bull run started in October 1990, lasting almost a decade until the dotcom bubble burst around the turn of the millennium. There are however disputes over the starting point, which could render celebrations over the latest milestone premature.The US Financial Industry Regulatory Authority reckons the tech rally began in 1987, rather than 1990, meaning the current bull market would need to continue until at least the summer of 2021 to break the record. Some analysts argue bull and bear market status is unclear, not set in stone, and that identifying them reflects an unhealthy obsession with arbitrary turning points in financial markets.The S\u0026ampP 500 closed at 2,862.96 points on Tuesday, within touching distance of the record high reached in January. Among the best performers so far this year are the watchmaker Fossil, Netflix and Twitter. The latest milestone comes as the US economy goes through its second longest-ever unbroken expansion, helped by low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve and sluggish inflation. Having collapsed during the crisis and still gradually recovering, stock markets have also benefited from the world’s biggest central banks pumping billions into their economies through quantitative easing.The rise of the tech giants has boosted the overall value of the US stock market. The five so-called “Faangs” – Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google – are together worth more than $3tn, making them more valuable than the entire FTSE 100. Donald Trump’s corporate tax cuts have boosted US corporate profits, helping to drive the stock market higher. The president celebrated stocks reaching record levels earlier this year, tweeting: “Dow just crashes through 25,000. Congrats! Big cuts in unnecessary regulations continuing.”Little more than a month after the president’s tweet, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by more than 1,000 points amid fears over rising inflation that could have prompted the Fed to raise interest rates faster than expected. Concerns over a global trade war instigated by Washington have also rocked markets in recent months and could still pose a threat. Analysts said US stocks could continue rising over the course of this year, although warned against placing faith in arbitrary definitions of strength, such as markets having risen for a period or reaching certain levels.Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard, said: “Is there any reason for this trend in US equities to fade? Not quickly. We still expect strong growth in US economy next year, helped by the tax cuts.“There are risks. The Fed could tighten too much, China could lose control of its debt problems, or Italian bonds could cause another sovereign debt crisis.”"},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a9073dd5e5a2e3f8fbaac451d321d8159526719/0_0_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1b868a946f8b25eebe5c9f942e69ca5","title":"how to pollution proof your skin","story":"Polluted air is a problem whether you live in or out of town. Author and beauty expert Lindsey Kelk shares the latest intel on keeping your skin protected from its harmful effects  According to Dr Doris Day, “urban dust” has been shown to contain a cocktail of 224 toxic chemicals, making it possibly the only cocktail I have never been tempted to try, and all those chemicals can lead to a whole host of skin problems dryness, loss of collagen, acne and there has even been research linking air pollution to dark spots. Because getting those from too much sun wasn’t already enough of a problem … Start at the sourceAs we all know, prevention is always better than the cure – and while topical products designed to fight the effects of polluted air are a must, preventing damage before it takes place starts with your diet. A diet rich in antioxidants is the first way to help neutralise free radicals (those are the particles floating around in the air that attach themselves to your skin and damage it at a cellular level – find out more about these epidermal vampires here). Dr Andrew Weil recommends loading up on fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes, watermelon, blueberries, carrots and leafy greens. On top of your fruits and veggies, protein is also key to rebuilding cells – your best bets are tofu, lean meat, fish, eggs, beans and nuts. As well as eating a healthy diet, drinking plenty of water is an essential factor in the fight against damage caused by pollution. Hydrated skin is healthy skin and ensures your epidermis – the top layer of skin and our barrier against all the chemicals and particles in the air – stays plump and in tact. For extra hydration and antioxidant protection, try adding green tea to your diet. It’s packed with catechins, which not only help your skin repair itself, they have also been proven to improve heart health and help combat hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Also, red wine is a great source of resveratrol, which is amazing for skin (and yes, I know the alcohol dehydrates my skin but the wine gods giveth and they taketh away). Get city-readyEven though people living in densely populated, urban areas are generally found to have better skincare regimens than those living in more rural areas, thanks to all the pollution we face – and the free radicals that accompany that pollution – our skin usually shows signs of ageing more quickly than our country-dwelling counterparts. This is where your choice of products really comes into play. Look out for formulas targeted specifically at protecting your face from pollution, then follow up with with the same considerations as with your diet. Every skincare expert you can name, from Caroline Hirons to Nadine Baggott, has extolled the wonders of vitamin C, the collagen-building wonder ingredient that brightens and evens tone, protects from free radicals and, some studies have shown, may even help protect against sun damage. It works well in conjunction with vitamin E, so look out for products that contain both.While it’s important to protect against free radicals, it is essential to protect against the effects of the sun. UV rays and pollution work in tandem to destroy skin cells and cause lasting damage so always make sure you have protection, all year round. Remember, if there is daylight, there are UV rays. Sunscreen is for life, not just bikini weather. And, yes, I know it sounds dull, but long sleeves and covered legs will help protect your skin even more. Physical barriers against the sun and polluted air are one of the reasons your body ages so much more slowly than your weather-battered face, so maybe try one of those surfer-chic long-sleeved swimsuits next time you’re at the lido.After exposureAt the end of the day, your skin will need serious cleansing, even if it doesn’t look dirty. Double cleansing is a must, for city and country dwellers alike. Over the course of a day, your face has had to deal with pollution, sunscreen and makeup and they’re just the best case scenarios. Thorough cleansing should never strip skin, you definitely don’t want to compromise your natural barriers. Try a cleansing balm for your first cleanse, to dislodge the daily grime then move on to a soothing cream or refreshing wash-off cleanser for the second cleanse, whatever feels best for your skin type. Post cleansing, your skin should feel soft and clean but never tight. Apply your treatment serums and moisturising creams immediately after cleansing. Leaving skin to “breathe” isn’t a real thing, as soon as you’ve rinsed away your cleanser, it starts losing moisture – skin doesn’t need to breath, it needs to be cared for so be a pal and give it what it wants: proper hydration.While the effects of pollution on the skin do sound really rather frightening, they don’t have to be. I’m probably not going to give up going outside for the sake of a smoother complexion, but with the right diet and skincare tips, I don’t have to. Gentle cleansing, a hardworking hydrating cream, daily SPF and lots of red wine, I mean, lots of water, should ensure glowing skin, wherever you may be.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

There were 37 deaths in the first six months of this year, when there were 38 in the whole of the previous year. Between January and June, 41,000 people in the region caught the disease, which is one of the most infectious on the planet. That’s nearly double the number of cases in 2017.What is going on? Significant numbers of people are choosing not to have their children vaccinated with the MMR vaccine, against measles, mumps and rubella. The reasons they are making that choice and the implications of it are very concerning.It would be easy to blame it on one man. In 1998, Andrew Wakefield, then a gastroenterologist at the Royal Free hospital in London, published a paper in the Lancet that linked MMR to gut problems in children who had autism. The paper featured the cases of eight children. It might have been no big deal, except that, at a press conference, Wakefield advised against the triple MMR vaccine. The press ran lurid stories featuring children whose autism became evident at around the time they had their MMR jab and sent shivers through the hearts of many parents.Donald Trump himself has been numbered among the vaccine sceptics, telling a story about a two-year-old who “got” autism a week after she had the MMR. Wakefield appeared at one of his inauguration balls. There was talk of Trump setting up a committee to review the “link” to autism under vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr, although that didn’t happen.In France, Marine Le Pen, who leads the National Rally (formerly Front National) party, has championed the right of the people to say no in the face of a move by the government to make 11 vaccines mandatory for children – as is the case for diphtheria, tetanus and polio currently. The plan has emerged because of increasing vaccine hesitancy and a low MMR immunisation rate.Italy’s attempt to boost vaccination for children has run into major political problems. Last July health minister Beatrice Lorenzin made 10 vaccines mandatory for children enrolling in state-run schools, following concerns about measles outbreaks, with nearly 5,000 cases recorded last year (a rate second only to Romania in Europe). But the rise of the Five Star Movement appears to have put paid to that. The new health minister, Giulia Grillo, has now said parents will not be required to present schools with a vaccination certificate.The founder of Five Star, Beppe Grillo (no relation), is a vaccine sceptic. Vaccines can be as dangerous as the diseases they protect against, he once asserted. In 2015 the party proposed changing the law on vaccination, citing “the link between vaccinations and specific illnesses such as leukaemia, poisoning, inflammation, immunodepression, inheritable genetic mutations, cancer, autism and allergies”. Scientific misunderstandings are common among the anti-vaccine movements, along with a failure to properly weigh experimental results. Not all scientific studies are equal. Vaccine denialists tend to be selective in their approach to the evidence.Vaccine hesitancy does not map neatly on to party affiliation. Alongside the Trump-following populists and the rightwing anti-establishment inidualists are the left-leaning Mother Earth-lovers. These are people who worry about injecting their children with chemical compounds in the same way that they worry about pesticides in their food.Common to both groups is suspicion of big pharma. Anti-vaccine rhetoric cites pharmaceutical company scandals, of which there have been many. Multinational companies are only interested in profits and not to be trusted with children’s bodies, the doubters argue. These doubts spread globally online. You don’t see articles in newspapers arguing that vaccination causes autism any more, but that doesn’t matter in an era of social media. Mainstream scientists who want to demolish the conspiracy theories and bad science and explain how the evidence stacks up in favour of vaccinesare talking into a vacuum.Measles is a serious disease. Your healthy daughter may not die from it, but the fragile child down the road or the older man whose immune system is compromised will struggle to survive an infection. Vaccination used to be for the good of the community. We were all part of a social compact. We were vaccinated and allowed our precious children to have jabs in order to deprive these diseases of a home in our midst. But this is another era, in which the inidual is king, mistrust of authority is rife and vaccine-preventable diseases may well be making a major comeback.• Sarah Boseley is the ’s health editor"},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/264b1cb778ac36db8246a6d36c8d7c88a40edc27/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf92bd9b7ca61be86463f577394b724a","title":"project britain debate oxford cambridge expressway","story":"Decisions about the Oxford-Cambridge expressway, and the vast conurbation it will create, are made behind closed doorsWhere democracy counts most, it is nowhere to be seen. The decisions that shape the life of a nation are taken behind our backs. With occasional exceptions, public choice is reserved for trivia. The most consequential choices, as they are the longest lasting, arguably involve\u0026nbspmajor\u0026nbspinfrastructure. The number of disasters in\u0026nbspthis field is remarkable. A classic paper by the economic geographer Bent Flyvbjerg, Survival of the Unfittest, explains that there is an innate tendency on the part of policymakers to choose the worst possible projects, as a result of the lock-in of fixed ideas at an early stage. This is caused, his evidence shows, not by accidental error or even delusional optimism, but by “strategic misrepresentation”. Advisers become advocates, and advocates become hucksters boosting their favoured projects.The schemes that look best on paper, and therefore are most likely to be adopted, are those that have been scrutinised the least. Democratic debate would reveal their flaws. This is why planners who wish to leave their mark treat it as a threat. To the megalomaniacs who draw lines on maps, public opinion is like landscape features: it must be cleared out of the way.A striking example is the government’s plan for an Oxford-to-Cambridge expressway. A decision to which we have not been party, which will irrevocably change the region it affects, is imminent. The new road, says the plan, will support the construction of a million homes.To give you some sense of the scale of this scheme, consider that Oxfordshire will have to provide 300,000 of them. It currently contains 280,000 homes. In 30 years, if this scheme goes ahead, the county must build as many new houses, and the infrastructure, public services and businesses required to support them, as have been built in the past 1,000. A million new homes amounts, in effect, to an Oxford-Cambridge conurbation.But none of this is up for debate. By the time we are asked for our opinion, there will be little left to discuss but the colour of the road signs. The questions that count, such as whether the new infrastructure should be built, or even where it should be built, will have been made without us.The justification for this scheme is not transport or housing as an end in itself. Its objective, according to the National Infrastructure Commission, is to enable the region “to maximise its economic potential”. Without this scheme, the commission insists, Oxford and Cambridge and the region between them “will be left behind, damaging the UK’s global competitiveness”.This reasoning, you might hope, would prompt some major questions. Is continued growth, in one of the wealthiest regions of the world, desirable? If it is desirable, does it outweigh the acceleration of climate breakdown the scheme will cause? When air pollution\u0026nbspalready exceeds legal limits, are new roads and their associated infrastructure either appropriate or safe? And are we really engaged in a race with other nations, in which being “left behind” is something to be\u0026nbspfeared?But these questions are not just closed to debate. They are not even recognised as questions. The megalomaniacs with their pencils, the rulers with their rulers, assume that their unexamined premises are shared by everyone.All the tendencies Flyvbjerg warned against are evident. Instead of asking “Do we need this scheme?”, the government agency Highways England, which is supposed to offer objective advice, opens its webpage with the heading “Why we need this scheme”. It claims, against the evidence, that the expressway will enhance the “attractiveness of the region” and “provide a healthy, natural environment, reducing congestion”. It is the kind of propaganda you would expect in a totalitarian state.The National Infrastructure Commission, which also advises the government, ignores some issues altogether, such as how water for another million homes will be provided in a region where demand already exceeds supply. It makes glancing reference to another massive problem: the extra traffic the new road links will generate will exacerbate congestion on existing roads. Its answer? Expand them as well.A recent study by the Campaign to Protect Rural England shows that, far from relieving congestion, new\u0026nbsproad schemes create new traffic – a tendency first noted in 1925 and ignored by transport planners ever since. But the treadmill must keep turning. The bypasses must be bypassed with new bypasses, new jobs must be created to match the new housing, and new\u0026nbsphousing must be built to match the new jobs. Growth must continue, until it destroys everything it claims to enhance.The government says it will announce which of three possible corridors for the expressway it will choose by the end of this summer. The choice will be made by the transport secretary alone, after which public consultation will commence. But once the corridor has been chosen, only the trivial issues remain.As the infrastructure commission’s report makes clear, there is really only one option for the route the new road can take. It might be possible for objectors to argue that the course of the road should be shifted by 100 metres here or there, but all the significant questions will be beyond the scope of the inquiry.By imposing this decision, the government ignores its legal obligations. It has failed to conduct a strategic environmental assessment before the corridor decision is made, as the law insists. Under the Aarhus convention, public participation must begin while “all options are open”. But neither people nor law can be allowed to disrupt a grand design.This is not democracy. This is not even a semblance of democracy. Yet the consequences of such decisions will be greater than almost any others that are made, because\u0026nbspthey are irreversible. The bigger the question, the less we are asked."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/d63b8a7b8a2b7ba126ac9996d35255de87b223f4/0_0_5115_3069/master/5115.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dad029c012ab3c3150e8520d5969435","title":"2018 bird photographer of the year in pictures","story":"Pedro Jarque Krebs from Peru scoops the top prize of £5,000 for his vibrant image of American Flamingos preening"},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/01e42cb8b312817845b64c20456ada4beb6e6c78/0_24_3842_2305/master/3842.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd51bd1e5212bb4c8bb51baa526cfda2","title":"danny boyle james bond daniel craig","story":"Director’s departure over ‘creative differences’ expected to delay production, and could even lead to loss of star Daniel CraigThe immediate future of the James Bond franchise is in chaos after the sudden departure of the director Danny Boyle. Three months before shooting on the as-yet-untitled film was scheduled to start, the Oscar-winning film-maker behind Slumdog Millionaire and Trainspotting quit, leaving producers scrambling. A delay to the scheduled release date of 25 October 2019 looks inevitable there is also speculation the fallout could stretch further, claiming star Daniel Craig as another victim.A tweet from the franchise’s official account announced on Monday evening: “Michael G Wilson, Barbara Broccoli and Daniel Craig today announced that due to creative differences Danny Boyle has decided to no longer direct Bond 25.”Industry insiders suspect these differences revolve around the script, which Boyle wrote with his long-term collaborator John Hodge. The pair previously collaborated on Trainspotting and its sequel, as well as The Beach, A Life Less Ordinary and Boyle’s debut, Shallow Grave. The Bond script was reportedly a deal-breaker for Boyle, who took on the project after the departure of Sam Mendes, who directed Skyfall in 2009 before returning (having previously quit) for 2015’s Spectre.The producers were reportedly so keen to secure Boyle that they put an already completed screenplay, by the longtime 007 writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, on the back-burner. Purvis and Wade have previously written six Bond films, including all four Craig outings, as well as the final two starring his predecessor, Pierce Brosnan.Hodge and Boyle’s script – which is different in all respects – was thought to have been a work-in-progress until recently, and it is understood its themes were more topical than is traditional for a Bond film. A leaked casting-call sheet indicated that the key villain would be Russian, and Boyle has suggested the film would help the franchise evolve in the #MeToo and #TimesUp era.“You write in real time,” he said. “You acknowledge the legacy of the world of Bond and you write in the world – but you also write in the modern world as well.”Boyle indicated that the script featured a considerable coup de cinema – “it’s a great idea so hopefully it will work” – which some speculated could involve a high-concept plot in which Bond would be incarcerated for much of the running time – or, potentially, die.The high-stakes nature of such a twist, and the controversial real-life issues the film may have explored, may well have proved a sticking point with producers. Bond films have increasingly toyed with topicality, with Spectre hanging on an initiative to axe field agents in favour of virtual espionage. However, grappling with issues such as sexual assault and Russian influence in geopolitics might have been deemed too great a gamble.Although Mendes and Craig’s tenure has put Bond back in favour with liberal critics as well as punters, Eon Productions, the production company behind the franchise, would be unlikely to want to risk the alienation of a large part of its target market to placate talent. With budgets for Skyfall and Spectre exceeding $300m (£232m), little compromise for the film’s commercial prospects can be countenanced. Boyle and Hodge’s script is unlikely to survive the director’s exit, meaning that Purvis and Wade’s draft will need to be polished up for production, and the entire enterprise overhauled to account for a different story, characters and settings. This would add at least a year to the schedule, and the film may not be released until late-2020, at the earliest. Producers would be reluctant to delay further, as a 2020 release date would already mean a five-year gap between the new film and Spectre. Although there were four years between Craig’s second outing, Quantum of Solace (2008) and his third, Skyfall (2012), the longest break between Bond films is only six years – between Licence to Kill (1989) and GoldenEye (1995) – and that involved a change of actor in the leading role.This makes it yet more likely that Craig, 50, will call it a day. Until there was confirmation he would return alongside Boyle, speculation had been rife that the actor, a famously reluctant tuxedo wearer, would move on, with Idris Elba and Tom Hardy among those named as possible candidates to replace him. Promoting Spectre in 2015, Craig said he would rather slash his wrists than reprise the role months later, his departure seemed all but certain following that of Mendes. In 2016, Craig was reportedly offered $150m to star in another two Bond movies by Broccoli, and this year he was confirmed for at least one more.Craig and Boyle have worked together once before: when the former appeared as Bond, alongside the Queen, in a brief film that featured in the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony, which Boyle directed.Mark Tildesley, Boyle’s favoured production designer, was also recruited to the Bond film this year. His future on the project is now unknown. Boyle’s latest film, a romcom scripted by Richard Curtis, is scheduled for release in September 2019 – just a month before the Bond movie was due to come out. It is distributed by Universal Pictures, which recently took on UK distribution rights to the Bond films from Sony Pictures, which was responsible for getting Boyle’s most recent big screen release, T2: Trainspotting, into cinemas. Possible replacements for Boyle include Christopher Nolan, Christopher McQuarrie and Susanne Bier. McQuarrie’s latest film, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, was widely praised for its Bond-style plot and stunts. The film, which stars Tom Cruise, has so far made $500m at the box office."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/149733d35d4e43cbf8d3b02cc74afb8091d9f649/0_240_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae21f8f7e12578c695f0594ea382b39d","title":"harvey weinstein sued by actor emma loman over alleged at cannes","story":"German actor alleges producer made clear he could ruin her career if she reported 2006 incidentGerman actor Emma Loman has filed a lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein, alleging the disgraced movie mogul raped her in 2006 at the Cannes film festival.In a complaint filed on Monday in Los Angeles, Loman said that she met Weinstein in 2004 at the Venice film festival and he later invited her to Cannes as his guest to discuss her career.Loman said she was initially hesitant to accept the invitation but Weinstein was persistent, with his assistant calling her up to 30 times a day. Loman said she finally relented and found Weinstein to be very professional during several meetings. The lawsuit says that changed, however, after he lured her to his hotel suite, presumably to discuss possible acting roles in some of his films. “Upon arriving at Weinstein’s suite ... Weinstein quickly dropped his professional demeanor. He instead overpowered Loman and raped her,” the lawsuit says. It adds that the 66-year-old former Hollywood producer subsequently made it clear to Loman that he could ruin her career if she came forward.“Fearful both that no one would believe her and the potential retaliation from such a powerful figure, Loman stayed silent,” the lawsuit says. “It was only upon the late 2017 revelation of the scope of Weinstein’s wrongful actions ... that Loman felt safe coming forward to seek redress for Weinstein’s rape of her.”Loman is suing Weinstein for assault, violation of human trafficking laws, battery and false imprisonment.Weinstein has been accused by dozens of women of numerous incidents of sexual misconduct, ranging from harassment to rape. He is out on bail and has pleaded not guilty in New York to six counts allegedly committed against three women in 2004, 2006 and 2013.

Being delicious hot or cold, vegetarian-friendly and fairly cheap to put together, it’s my current top tip for a picnic. It also, of course, makes a nice lightish lunch or dinner, especially with a tomato salad on the side and, should you wish to make it in little triangles or cigars, rather than one large pie, is finger food of the highest order. In short, if you don’t have one already, you need a recipe for akopita in your life.In general, however, akopita recipes call simply for spinach, which, without further qualification, I assume to mean adult leaf, given that the Greeks seem too sensible a society to have abandoned it in favour of the oppressively iron-y baby leaf stuff better suited to salads (I try that in one recipe, and find it almost dissolves into the filling). Fortunately, I have a number of greengrocers nearby, but if you don’t, frozen whole-leaf spinach turns out to be a very decent alternative: make sure you defrost it thoroughly, then squeeze dry before adding it to the filling.In fact, whatever you use, it should be as dry as possible before it goes anywhere near the pastry, so you’ll need to reduce the water content. One way of doing this, of course, is to wilt it over heat until it sits in a pool of its own juice, and then drain it well, an approach favoured by Akis Petretzikis, Diane Kochilas and the Mazi cookbook, but I think this risks overcooking it. Much better to do as Vefa Alexiadou recommends in Greece: The Cookbook and massage the fresh leaves with salt instead: it’s quicker and the end result tastes much fresher. This also has the benefit of keeping the filling mixture relatively cool, which means you can bake it straight away without worrying any residual heat in the spinach will spoil the pastry. (NB: you can skip this step with frozen leaves.)This is entirely optional: Lenten recipes leave it out altogether, and there are vegan versions using tofu, but if you eat cheese, I’d highly recommend it, because it’s delicious. Feta is the standard choice, but a few recipes also add some grated kefalotiri, a harder, richer cheese often served fried as saganaki, though I don’t think it needs the extra flavour, unless you happen to have some in need of using up. Mazi is the only pie to eschew the white crumbly stuff altogether in favour of a bechamel sauce made with parmesan, which feels a bit underpowered in comparison: feta can’t be bettered, apparently.Traditionally, the filling is enriched with eggs, though Petretzikis uses cream cheese to give it a richer consistency, Tess Mallos uses ricotta, and Sofia Souli, whose Greek Cookery And Wines comes highly recommended by Jack Monroe, sticks in some evaporated milk and a good glug of oil as well, while Alexiadou uses ordinary milk and melted butter. Oil, butter and cream cheese are all judged a bit rich by testers, and evaporated milk a little sweet – indeed, it strikes me that, having worked so hard to squeeze the moisture from the leaves, it’s a bit counterintuitive to add more back in, with the exception of egg, which will set in the oven and firm up the filling in the process.All the recipes use alliums of some sort: leek and spring onion for Mazi, red onion and spring onion for Kochilas, white onion for Souli, and spring onions alone for Alexiadou and Petretzikis. I like the sweetness of the red onion and leek, and the grassy flavour of the spring onions, so, like Kouchilas, I’m going to use both.Far more important, in my opinion, is a generous hand with the herbs, which sets this dish apart from the hundreds of other permutations on the spinach-and-cheese theme from around the world. Dill is the most common choice, closely followed by mint and parsley, though Mazi also adds chervil and fennel leaves and Petretzikis Mediterranean hartwort and oregano. Hartwort proves hard to come by in a British summer, so, on advice, I use lovage instead, which gives the filling a very savoury quality, while chervil and fennel lend an aniseedy, almost ouzo-like whiff that’s more popular with the panel. Dill is easier to get hold of, however, and along with mint for freshness and a little oregano for Greekness, should provide enough in the way of herbaceous excitement.Petretzikis’s zippy lemon zest and a good grating of nutmeg are far more interesting seasonings than the more usual pepper and, rather boldly, I’m also going to add some bulgur wheat on Kochilas’s recommendation: not only does this help soak up any excess liquid, but it also gives her filling a far more interesting texture. You could use rice, or the little balls of grain and fermented milk known as trahana, if you’re lucky enough to have some – or, indeed, leave this element out altogether if you prefer.Though akopita is generally made with filo in restaurants and professional bakeries, Kouchilas and Petretzikis both make their own horiatiko, or village-style pastry, which is rather thicker and sturdier, but better flavoured than most commercially produced filo. However, the testers revolt, demanding more crunch and less wholemeal – one even goes as far as to threaten not to help again if I leave out the crisp top. That said, I’d recommend you have a go at homemade rustic filo one day it’s not much like the other stuff, but it is rather good.Last, a tip from Petretzikis: drizzle the sheets of pastry with olive oil rather than brushing it on, “so that they don’t stick to one another and air pockets can be created in between them. This makes the phyllo crunchier!” And one from me: leave the pie to cool slightly, or completely before serving for maximum enjoyment.1kg adult spinach, or frozen whole leaf spinach, defrostedSalt2 tbsp olive oil1 red onion or leek, finely chopped4 spring onions, chopped300g feta, crumbled25g dill, chopped20g mint, leaves removed and chopped3 sprigs oregano, chopped 50g bulgur wheat (optional)2 eggs, beatenZest of 1 unwaxed lemonNutmeg250g filo pastryOil, to brushTrim the spinach and wash well, then roughly chop.

Tip into a large bowl with the feta, herbs and bulgur, if using. Wring the spinach in handfuls until no more liquid comes out (it should look thoroughly wilted), stir into the cheese mix, then add the egg, zest, a glug of oil and a good grating of nutmeg and mix again (I find hands the best tool for this). Season lightly, remembering that feta is quite salty.Heat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. Brush a 30cm x 25cm baking tin with olive oil, then line with half the filo, brushing each sheet with oil as you go (a spray is useful here, if you have one), and taking care not to press them down in the process. Leave any excess overhanging the sides.Spoon in the filling, level the top, then put the lid on: repeat the layering process with the remaining pastry. Fold the overhang inwards, to make an edible rim, drizzle with more oil and cut into the desired portion sizes.

Chickpeas are a natural bedfellow for tahini, garlic and cumin. But chocolate? Mixed berries? Banoffee?It would help if Harry Tyndall had a rootsy backstory with which to sell his sweet hummus – if he were reviving an ancient Levantine dessert, say, or had been handed down a family recipe through 17 generations. But no – when he first had the idea, he struggled to find others who had tried anything similar (one US company, Delighted By Hummus, served as inspiration with its chocolate, vanilla and snickerdoodle flavours). His company, Hou Loves Hou, is the first to sell sweet hummus in the UK.Could the hot fudge brownies and creme brulees of this world really be defeated by hummus? Actually, Tyndall hopes to disrupt the spread market – compared with jams, nut butters and chocolate spreads, Hou is healthier, boasting lower sugar and saturated fat content, thanks to its virtuous chickpea base. Still, sweet hummus … would you put that in your mouth? I gamely opened the first of three nicely branded tubs (£2.99 for a 180g pot). All are smooth in texture, but the chocolate Hou is especially thick, thanks to the coconut milk included in its ingredients. The mixed berry Hou is the one that has the most detectable chickpea flavour, although it is unusual rather than unpleasant. It is being promoted as a jam alternative, but it is more like a creamy fruit spread. Banoffee is perhaps my favourite – a guilt-free substitute for nut butter that could work as a dessert filling – whereas the “choc-a-chick” chocolate hummus is similar to traditional chocolate spreads, not least in the sense that it is best eaten straight from the tub. All three make for a tasty, healthy breakfast when spread on brown bread. Tyndall suggests dipping strawberries in the chocolate one or serving the fruit hummus with yoghurt and granola (Delighted By Hummus has a range of recipes on its website including cookies, muffins and pretzels).Health is Tyndall’s main concern. He had a reckless youth, microwaving whole tubs of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s and drinking them as smoothies. Now 30, he suffers from kidney stones and gout, possibly as a consequence. He had to reinvent his diet – no red meat, no red wine and definitely no ice-cream smoothies – and that is where the idea for Hou came from. He is especially excited about entering the children’s market I can confirm that my two-year-old was particularly enthusiastic about the mixed berry flavour, shouting “more hummus” repeatedly in a way that definitely wouldn’t sound sickeningly middle-class if aired in public. Plus, the team behind Hou will be pleased to hear that,with no prior chickpea associations embedded in her head, she had no problem putting it in her mouth."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/943aed23338630e0bfe7a8233fe870b611afc234/712_845_3472_2084/master/3472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=787a8cfa208bed063e13cf6be6c5f0e8","title":"kick it out milestone 25 years lord ouseley","story":"Football people of a certain vintage will have felt a wince of disbelief that the game’s anti-racism campaign, Kick It Out, is 25 years old this season, marking a generation of struggle and remarkable progress.Reflecting on how profoundly attitudes have changed over the quarter century, the campaign’s chairman throughout, Lord Herman Ouseley, points to the outpouring of admiration for Cyrille Regis when the former West Bromwich Albion trailblazer died in January at the age of 59.Regis, his two West Brom teammates Laurie Cunningham and Brendon Batson, and a handful of other black players came through in the 1970s, when racist abuse rained down routinely from terraces and the football authorities never had much to say about it. When Regis died tributes were paid from all areas of the game’s establishment and fans at clubs where black players were once so abused stood for minutes of genuine applause.Ouseley says: “Even 10 or 15 years ago I am not sure we would have seen the warmth and praise for Cyrille Regis that we saw this year. That tells you something about how the game has changed.” Formerly the chief executive of the London borough of Lambeth, in 1993 Ouseley was chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality when he became the voluntary chairman of the inaugural Let’s Kick Racism Out of Football campaign.He adds: “The players have had a huge part in it, with their ability, and having the inner resilience to cope and succeed. I don’t want Kick It Out to take the praise our job is to help football to be better.”Citing Regis as an example encapsulates Kick It Out’s own course the campaign was established after he retired, with the worst years of football’s public racism receding, and it has played a great part in encouraging the culture which celebrated him.In 1991, the Football (Offences) Act made “indecent or racialist chanting” a criminal offence, a landmark step in recognising football’s disgrace and taking serious steps to outlaw it. Keith Alexander, at Lincoln City, was appointed as English football’s first black manager in 1993, the same year Paul Ince became the first black player to captain England.But there was still widespread racist abuse into the 90s and a climate of fear among the minority ethnic communities in neighbourhoods around many of the grounds, recalls Piara Powar, who was appointed Kick It Out’s national coordinator in 1998. He and Ouseley both recall that despite the campaign being funded by the FA and Premier League as well as the Professional Footballers’ Association from 1997, many senior people in football were not greatly interested.Powar and Ben Tegg, the campaign’s only members of staff then, wrote to all 92 professional clubs introducing themselves and the aims of the campaign. Only five replied. “There was absolute apathy, the issues were seen as inconsequential,” says Powar, who in 2010 became executive director of the Fans Against Racism in Europe (Fare) network. “In the 1980s if you were part of a minority you expected to get abused in daily life in football, behaviour which now seems unbelievable was happening freely. The worst was over, but in the 90s it was still there.Ouseley remembers arm-twisting and “shaming” clubs into taking part in the campaign, sometimes by telling chairmen that their closest rivals were signed up. It began with an eight-point plan, with posters at grounds, focusing on eliminating racism from football, and widened after 1997 to address all forms of discrimination.Many fans were already making strong efforts to oppose racism in the stands Powar gives credit to wider cultural improvements over the years, and clubs gradually engaged more fully with the campaign. Now, Ouseley is able to promote more optimistic aims: increasing the ersity of coaches, administrators and supporters, and football as a vehicle for social cohesion, from the grassroots up.Kick It Out came through arguably its most challenging period in 2012, after the high-profile bans for racist abuse handed down by FA disciplinary panels to Luis Suárez and John Terry, the latter having been found not guilty in a criminal prosecution of verbally abusing Anton Ferdinand. A number of black players refused to take part in Kick It Out’s annual day of action, including Regis’s nephew Jason Roberts, then at Reading, who protested at lack of progress, particularly the paucity of black coaches.Ouseley acknowledges that some people involved with Kick It Out felt hurt, believing the players were targeting the organisation that had worked for years to make a difference, but says he respected Roberts making his case. “He felt we didn’t do enough we talked, and I accepted I don’t shy away from criticism. We should engage with people on these matters and see what we can learn. It is positive if players are articulating an issue Jason Roberts was carrying more influence than us – I tell players they underestimate their power.”A remarkable 25 years since its formation, English football and the country around it are very different, but there is still a great deal of work for Kick It Out to do."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6210dc14b751d982964de43c2c763d492ec55c6/0_93_1433_859/master/1433.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a14457e93f1a011c48383d85877706a","title":"the largest number of siblings to score for their country","story":"Plus: immoveable wedding rings more cartoon characters and two unbeaten teams in one season. Mail us or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“I noticed that Vincent, Sébastien and Olivier Thill have all scored for Luxembourg and wondered what the record is for the number of siblings who have scored for their country?” ponders Simon Hurst. “Their father, Serge Thill, also played for the national team but didn’t score.”Russell Connor has another hat-trick of siblings to add to the list. “Alvin, Lorenzo and Jonathan Tehau are all brothers and have scored for Tahiti,” says Russell. “They also have a cousin – Teaonui Tehau – who has played and scored for Tahiti. Pleasingly there was also an instance of them all scoring in the same match: a 10-1 victory over Samoa in 2012 when Lorenzo scored four and the others got one each.”Three siblings is good. But, as Kári Tulinius points out, three and a half is better. “Brothers Thordur, Bjarni, and Jóhannes Gudjónsson have all scored for the Icelandic national team,” says Kári, “as has their half-brother Björn Bergmann Sigurdarson.”Luke Ingham informs us that the magnificent Laudrup brothers, Michael and Brian, hold the record for the most goals scored by siblings. Michael hit 37 and Brian 21. “You also mentioned the Thill father, which got me thinking about goalscoring families,” notes Luke. “The Laudrups can add their father Finn’s tally (nine) to get a total of 67. “This, however, is narrowly beaten by the dedicated PeleAyew footballing dynasty, which includes Abedi Pele (33), Kwame Ayew (9), André Ayew (14) and Jordan Ayew (12). That’s a grand total of 68 international goals. The young Ayews also have a sister, Imani, who is a professional footballer, but I couldn’t find out anything about a goal record internationally.”The answer to this question is, unfortunately, always Paolo Diogo. Readers of a nervous disposition may want to skip forward a few paragraphs. From 2004:Servette midfielder Paulo Diogo paid a heavy price for his romantic obligations. Diogo jumped up on a metal perimeter fence to salute travelling fans in celebration of setting up his team’s third goal for Jean Beauséjour in the 87th minute of their 4-1 away win over Schaffhausen in the Swiss Super League.The Swiss-Portuguese, who only recently married, failed to notice that his newly-obtained wedding ring was caught in the barrier until he jumped back down and both the ring and most of his finger did not come with him. But that was not the end of his suffering. With Diogo in obvious pain and distress the game was held up while match stewards took part in a frantic search to retrieve the finger, which did not impress the referee Florian Etter one little bit.Despite Diogo’s misfortune the 29-year-old midfielder got no sympathy from Etter and was promptly booked by the official for the length of his celebration. Diogo’s terrible night was capped when surgeons at a Zurich hospital admitted they were unable to re-attach his severed digit and advised the amputation of the remaining stump.”In last week’s Knowledge we looked at players who were named after cartoon characters. And there’s more where that came from!“Glaybson Yago Souza Lisboa is a Brazilian full-back who goes by the name Yago Pikachu,” reports Russell Connor (again). “He’s at Vasco da Gama at the minute. Here’s a video featuring some of his highlights.”For those over the age of past it, Pikachu is a species from the contemporary video game phenomenon, “Pokémon”.“I see that Benfica and Porto are both unbeaten thus far this season,” wrote Paolo Cabrelli in 2013. “Has a top league (OK, let’s include Portugal) ever had two unbeaten teams in one season?”Finished leagues containing two unbeaten teams are rarer than hen’s teeth. But thanks to the wonder that is RSSSF we were able to dig out a few examples: Estonia in 1992 (with Norma Tallinn and EP Johvi both unbeaten in the 13-game, two-stage league system), Hong Kong in 1985-86 and the unfinished Yugoslavian season of 1998-99.• For thousands more questions and answers look through our archive.“Neil Harris and Frank Lampard locked managerial horns this weekend,” writes Joe McDonagh. “Is this the first instance of two managers facing each other who went to the same private school, Brentwood (since the Wanderers v Old Etonion days)?”“Cheltenham Town have opened the season with three consecutive 1-0 defeats.

Heading days upriver, he has often headed into the Javari Valley, a vast indigenous reserve where such activities are forbidden.“That’s the town larder,” he says. “Everybody enters there to fish and hunt.”Until last year, Costa, 53, sold his catch and prey to the crews of illegal gold dredgers – known as garimpeiros – who used this town as a support base before heading deep into the reserve, sucking up gold from the Jandiatuba River and pumping poisonous mercury into its muddy waters.Last year, however, Costa was at the centre of an inquiry into the alleged massacre of up to 10 tribespeople from an uncontacted group in the reserve. The case made headlines around the world, and forced the Brazilian government – who had already been alerted about the garimpeiros’ mining activities – into action. In late August, a pre-planned army operation destroyed four dredgers and seized another near the town. In November, Funai staff joined a second army operation that blew up ten more mining barges and headed into the reserve to look for evidence that a massacre had occurred.But they were unable to find anything conclusive. Instead, while prosecutors are still to close their investigation, the case has exposed the vulnerability of isolated groups in the Javari Valley, the prejudice indigenous people face in communities around them, and the difficulties of such investigations in areas of inaccessible wilderness.Locals said it was the third time the garimpeiros had set up in São Paulo de Olivença. Although many were out-of-towners, some locals, including Costa, delivered supplies to them. The garimpeiros barges’ were located days by boat from the town, deep inside the reserve.Costa and two other men, Manoel Castro and Roque Alves Rocha, were named in an anonymous denunciation received last August by Funai, Brazil’s indigenous agency, which included a badly recorded conversation and a photo of Costa with a paddle. The tip-off said the men had boasted of killing up to 10 indigenous people and had stolen the paddle and other artefacts. Other evidence led credibility to the denunciation. A flight over the area found some maloca longhouses had been burnt – common practice after a death in local tribes.Prosecutors in Tabatinga – a city six hours away by boat – opened an investigation and requested arrest warrants for the three men. A judge turned these down and authorised searches of their properties instead. Interviewed by TV Globo’s national news programme Jornal Nacional, the three men denied the accusations that they had been responsible for a massacre. “It is something I never did,” said Rocha. Castro said he had not seen the indigenous people, but that he and Costa had found two paddles in a canoe and taken one. Costa refused to say any more to the channel.But in an interview with the , Costa refuted being on the recording and said that he and Manoel Bida had found the paddle two years earlier in a canoe at a place called Três Bocas, deep inside the reserve, near footprints an isolated group had left crossing a river.“We didn’t see them, just their traces. It’s common there,” he says. Costa alleges that the supposed massacre had been devised by those who want to force the authorities to act over gold dredging, but doesn’t specify who this might be.He says it would be impossible to kill so many light-footed indigenous people and survive. He also alleges, despite having no evidence, that the isolated tribe practises cannibalism.“If they kill us, they eat us,” he says.Indigenous people around São Paulo de Olivença routinely face discrimination, but prejudice against them has increased since the denunciation, for which they were unjustly blamed, says one local leader, talking anonymously after receiving threats. Speaking to the , some local people say they feel indigenous people receive too much money in government benefits and believe the reserve is too big for the indigenous population that live there. Funai staff were threatened when they reached the town in November 2017 for a joint operation with army and environment agency officials, a federal prosecutor says. Three months had passed since the original tip-off – a delay criticised by Sydney Possuelo, a former Funai president who had been instrumental in gaining protected status for the Javari Valley.As they headed upriver, soldiers blew up 10 dredgers. Funai officials quizzed crews and left the soliders working to reopen one of the agency’s bases on the Jandiatuba River, which had been closed in 2012.This was important to deter garimpeiros from entering the area, says Beto Marubo, an indigenous leader working to raise international attention over the threats to the Javari Valley’s 16 isolated tribes.“Without these bases, the isolated Indians who roam this territory become vulnerable,” he says.The Funai group carried on up the Jandiatuba River. Before reaching Três Bocas, they had found an abandoned gold dredger. At the site of the alleged massacre, they found no sign of the killings – though what evidence would have remained after three months is unclear. No police took part in the expedition.This was a difficult trip involving arduous travelling through remote and inhospitable terrain, says Bruno Pereira, the Funai isolated indigenous specialist who led a team that included Jair Candor, one of Funai’s most experienced isolated authorities (featured in award-winning documentary Piripkura). Since 1987, Funai has avoided contact with isolated tribes – who have attacked and killed employees in the past, and been decimated by viruses passed on by outsiders. Trekking inland in search of signs that the tribe was healthy, they came across a plantation of fruit and vegetables, then a settlement. Because of the seriousness of the denunciation, they decided to enter and found fires still smouldering, temporary thatched-roof shelters called tapiri, slings for blowpipes, clay pots, arrowheads, bones of tapir, wild boar and alligator that had been cooked and eaten, as well as a body-length ceremonial mask.If the alleged massacre had happened, it was unlikely that this established settlement would still be there, he says, because isolated groups flee danger. This conclusion is shared by Daniel Mayaruna, 44, an indigenous man from Javari who was also on the expedition. Daniel saw a community of his “relatives” in good shape, but says the abandoned mining barge just 10km away was profoundly worrying.“There are a lot of isolated relatives in this region and my concern is that garimpeiros could kill them,” he says. Adam Mol, a volunteer Polish doctor, shot video footage of the village. “We didn’t find any indications of a massacre,” he says.Accusations of massacres are not unknown in the Javari Valley. Last August Bruno Pereira, the Funai official responsible for monitoring its isolated groups, led an expedition in the south of the reserve, following reports of another mass killing related by an indigenous man. Mol went with him.Mol brought a drone along – equipment that Funai did not have. The agency has been decimated by budget cuts under the austerity regime of President Michel Temer. As the expedition headed along the Jutaí River, around the area where the killing allegedly took place, they came across a small camp on the side of the water that the isolated group had just vacated, leaving an axe, bow and arrow and other artefacts behind. Then Mol’s drone spotted the main village just a kilometre away, with people, communal thatched buildings, and plantations. They retreated, reasoning that the group would have moved had they suffered a massacre.“The drone footage gave us the intel we needed,” says Mol.Both cases underline just how hard it is to investigate allegations of possible crimes in such remote regions. In Tabatinga, federal prosecutor Pablo Beltrand says the tip-off over the supposed Jutaí River massacre was “not such a reliable report” and presented “contradictions”. On the alleged massacre involving the tip-off, Beltrand has just received Funai’s report on the expedition and is analysing it. The agency had been reluctant to share sensitive information, such as the location of isolated groups. That the isolated tribe has stayed in the region is “something to be considered in the investigation”, Beltrand says. He has yet to conclude his inquiry. But he has little to go on – a paddle, a conversation, an anonymous denunciation. Meanwhile, smaller wooden mining barges are now reportedly being built beside a river in São Paulo de Olivença. The garimpeiros may yet return.

But what’s the real story behind the rise? Three mothers talk about the joy of finally having a baby long after it would once have been possibleTo celebrate reaching half a century, Gemma Barnes wrote a list of the 50 things she hoped to achieve. Topping it was an ambition that a few years ago would have seemed absurd: she wanted to have a baby. But two years on, Barnes is cuddling her eight-month-old daughter, and while that means most of the other 49 ambitions will have to wait, she is delighted to be a mother.Barnes’s situation is unusual, but she is certainly not alone. In June data published by the Office for National Statistics showed the number of births to 50-plus women has quadrupled over the last two decades, up from 55 in 2001 to 238 in 2016. During that period there were 1,859 births in the UK to women over 50, and 153 to women over 55. Flying the flag for older motherhood have been a host of celebrities, most recently actor Brigitte Nielsen who was 54 when her fifth child, a daughter named Frida, arrived this summer. US singer Janet Jackson gave birth in January, aged 50, to son Eissa. Perhaps most visible of all has been US Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq veteran who lost both legs when her helicopter was shot down in 2004. She gave birth earlier this year, also aged 50, and was photographed soon afterwards, protesting against Trump’s immigration policies while holding newborn Maile on her lap.At first, Barnes wasn’t sure whether she wanted to go down that route. “You want your baby to be yours. I was thinking, would she look like me? Would she have my nose? My hair colour? But the doctor started talking about how when you carry a baby you shape so much about his or her personality and behaviour during the pregnancy. I started to think that was right, and that carrying the child was very important.”Having made the decision to go ahead, there was an egg donor as well as a sperm donor to choose. “You do it all online and it seems a bit surreal, and yes, you do think you’re playing God. These two people will never meet, never know one another, and together their cells will create a baby – your baby. It felt a huge responsibility, especially as I was making decisions all on my own.”Philippa Hodgson, who is 58 and the mother of a four-year-old, was similarly unsure at first about whether to use an egg donor, but like Barnes went ahead when she realised it would give her the best chance of a baby. She had met her husband when she was 45 her daughter Roxanne was conceived using his sperm and a donor egg. “I was very shocked at first by the idea that we could use another woman’s egg,” she says. “I felt my child wouldn’t really be my own. But now she’s here I couldn’t love her more. Occasionally she does something that I don’t recognise as being connected to either my husband or myself and I think, how beautiful – that must be because of something in her genes from the donor.”Despite being reconciled to using a donated egg, though, neither Barnes nor Hodgson has told everyone in their lives about that element of their story, and nor has the third mother I spoke to, Carol, who is 61 and has children aged 13 and 10. (Barnes and Hodgson are pseudonyms Carol is happy to use her first name.) Carol’s feeling is that her decision to use an egg donor is not secret information, but it is private – and it would invade her children’s privacy to broadcast it to the world. All three women, incidentally, are entirely committed to telling their children how they were conceived. Hodgson says she talked to her little girl recently about it: “I told her that a kind lady gave me an egg because mummy couldn’t use her own eggs. And she replied, ‘You are my only mummy.’ I was gobsmacked.”All the same, some professionals working in the field of later-life pregnancy are concerned about what Nina Barnsley, director of the Donor Conception Network, which supports families with children born as a result of donated gametes, describes as a “fog” around the subject, because so few women feel able to be open about egg donation: “It’s still a taboo. Many older mothers feel they are up against it enough in terms of other people’s views, and being open about this would be something else to criticise them for.” Celebrities, meanwhile, are often coy about the precise details of how they conceived, giving rise to the misconception that young people can postpone pregnancy until their sixth decade. “As a society we need to have a proper conversation,” says Barnsley. “The technology means it’s possible to have babies until we’re 75 – but is that what we want?”Adam Balen, professor of reproductive medicine at Leeds University and fertility spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, shares Barnsley’s concerns. “We’re not very good in the west at preventative medicine, and in the world of infertility we are treating lots of things that could have been prevented,” he says. If IVF has the reputation for being a panacea then that, he stresses, is misplaced. “IVF doesn’t work for everyone, and it’s not available on the NHS for everyone.” As well as being expensive (some of the women I spoke to have spent upwards of £20,000 on their quest for a baby, and anecdotally others have spent far more), late pregnancy carries risks, says Balen. Miscarriage and pre-eclampsia, in particular, are more likely and the use of donated gametes increases those risks. Stresses around assisted conception can also affect a relationship.Both Carol and Hodgson have been mistaken for their child’s grandmother but all three women say they look a lot younger than their years and that few other mothers seem to clock that there is anything unusual about their family. Perhaps, Barnes muses, it takes a woman who feels younger than she is to e into late motherhood.For Gemma, being older didn’t mean biting her nails with worry through the pregnancy. “Because the egg was from a younger donor, the risks aren’t so great. I felt fantastic throughout. I concentrated on staying calm, on connecting with the baby growing inside me.” Most older mothers are advised, as she was, to have a caesarean. “It was a very easy birth: it took 10 minutes to get her out, and half an hour to stitch me up. And of course meeting her was so wonderful – I’d waited a long time for that moment.”For Carol, though, pregnancy was a scary time. “I had miscarried in the past and knew I had a higher chance of miscarrying because of my age. I felt I had so much to lose – it was never going to be a question of ‘you can give it another shot’ the way it would be for a younger woman,” she says. She developed pre-eclampsia towards the end of her first pregnancy and both her babies were born by caesarean. Unlike Barnes, she found that a “very peculiar” experience. Once her babies had arrived, though, she loved the early weeks and months with them. “I felt I appreciated them in a way that you perhaps only do with something that hasn’t been easy,” she says. She struggles to think of any way being older has disadvantaged her children.“I know plenty of people much younger than me who don’t seem to have much energy,” she says. “I think I do as much with my children as the other mothers I know – I only recently stopped bouncing on the trampoline with them. I don’t feel significantly different from when I was younger.” And then, she says, there are the advantages. “I stopped working by the time I had children, so I’ve been able to put all my time and energy into their lives.” Barnes works part-time, but feels she is able to devote more of her time to her daughter Hannah (not her real name) than she could have done when she was younger. “I’m in a much better place now than I was 20 years ago,” she says. “I’m very settled in myself, very content. I’m fitter than I’ve ever been, I’ve got enough money to be comfortably off and to provide for her. Hannah is everything to me and I don’t have to prove myself.”Understandably, the women who are making it work want to concentrate on the positives they bat off any suggestions that there might be disadvantages. “I don’t feel different from anyone else at mother and baby groups because, quite simply, no one has any idea I’m older,” says Barnes. “Having a baby is a great leveller. When you’re mixing with other parents it’s all about them, how they’re sleeping and feeding and so on. No one asks you how old you are.” Carol is more selfconscious about her age, perhaps because she is now in her 60s and has a child still at primary school. “Telling people how old I am is always a bit scary: you think, will people see me in a different light? I’m very careful about who I share it with. I don’t mind telling friends who have got to know me, but people I don’t know are more likely to judge me in a negative way.”She has also found her own needs squeezed between those of her children and her parents. “I had a very difficult stage where every time the phone rang I didn’t know whether it would be someone calling from school to say my son needed me or someone calling to say one of my frail parents had fallen down the stairs.” And if her own parents have had their experience of grandparenting curtailed, she knows that is likely to be repeated. “Will I ever be a grandmother? I do wonder about that.” Meanwhile, she says, some of her friends are already grandparents. “It does seem a bit strange, that we’re the same age but in such different situations,” she says.Barnsley has some concerns about the trend. “Fiftysomething motherhood will only ever be a choice for the well-off,” she says. “And some women will spend a lot of money on something that doesn’t, in the end, work out. Imagine borrowing £50,000 and then being unsuccessful.” She also wonders where the child’s perspective is in the debate. “I’m thinking of 21-year-olds who instead of travelling the world will be looking after a parent with Alzheimer’s,” she says. “They run the risk of being out of sync with their peers, and that might not be easy.” (This is also, of course, the case for men who have children in their 50s and over, although that is less rarely raised as an issue.)Barnes believes later-life motherhood will become much more common and she welcomes it. “The only two disadvantages, as I see it, are genetics – ie your child doesn’t share your genes – and the risk of dying while your children are still young.” Like Hodgson, she found the genetic issues faded into the background once her baby appeared, although she does sometimes worry about Hannah’s medical history, and what she might not know about it. In the future, she thinks young women will be encouraged to freeze their eggs for later use, as is currently being debated but at present in the UK human eggs can usually only be frozen for a decade, and fertility specialists say eggs from a woman’s 20s and early 30s would give her the best chance of a child in her 50s. So for egg freezing to be useful, the law would have to change – and some fertility clinics would like to see that happen. Other countries have different guidelines and legislation around fertility, and some British women travel to Spain, Cyprus and India in the hope of making it easier for themselves.One thing everyone seems to be in agreement on is that it would be better for young people in particular, and the whole population in general, to know more about fertility. Hodgson wishes she had learned more about it at school. In his role as chair of the British Fertility Society, Balen has called for the curriculum to be widened to teach young people about how to achieve pregnancy, as well as how to avoid it. And yet, one major reason women are tending to leave pregnancy until their 30s is for economic reasons: most twentysomethings can barely afford to pay the rent, let alone provide for a family. Workplace pressures on thirtysomethings to get promoted and zip up the career ladder is another factor weighing against younger motherhood and however well-informed teenagers become about fertility, there is no guarantee they will meet the person they want to raise a child with before the age of 35.Kamal Ahuja, scientific director of the London Women’s Clinic, which treats women up to the age of 50 but makes occasional exceptions for over-50s, says that while any doctor would advise childbearing in a woman’s 20s or early 30s, the emotional, financial and social realities, added to the fact that human beings are living “stronger, longer and with greater ambitions” mean the trend is almost certainly set to grow. He predicts that medical advances will make it easier and cheaper in the years ahead.Gemma Barnes, meanwhile, hasn’t written her to-do list for her 52nd birthday, which is coming up later this year.

He is one of 44 million US graduates struggling to repay a total of $1.4tn. Were they right to believe their education was ‘priceless’?On Halloween in 2008, about six weeks after Lehman Brothers collapsed, my mother called me from Michigan to tell me that my father had lost his job in the sales department of Visteon, an auto parts supplier for Ford. Two months later, my mother lost her job working for the city of Troy, a suburb about half an hour from Detroit. From there our lives seemed to accelerate, the terrible events compounding fast enough to elude immediate understanding. By June, my parents, unable to find any work in the state where they spent their entire lives, moved to New York, where my sister and I were both in school. A month later, the mortgage on my childhood home went into default.After several months of unemployment, my mother got a job in New York City, fundraising for a children’s choir. In the summer of 2010, I completed my studies at New York University, where I received a BA and an MA in English literature, with more than $100,000 of debt, for which my father was a guarantor. My father was still unemployed and my mother had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. She continued working, though her employer was clearly perturbed that she would have to take off every Friday for chemotherapy. To compensate for the lost time, on Mondays she rode early buses into the city from the Bronx, where, after months of harrowing uncertainty, my parents had settled. She wanted to be in the office first thing.In January 2011, Chase Bank took full possession of the house in Michigan. Our last ties were severed by an email my father received from the realtor, who had tried and failed to sell the property, telling him he could now cancel the utilities. In May, I got a freelance contract with a newspaper that within a year would hire me full-time – paying me, after taxes, roughly $900 every two weeks. In September 2011, my parents were approved for bankruptcy, and in October, due to a paperwork error, their car was repossessed in the middle of the night by creditors. Meanwhile, the payments for my debt – which had been borrowed from a variety of federal and private lenders, most prominently Citibank – totalled about $1,100 a month.Now 30, I have been incapacitated by debt for a decade. The delicate balancing act that my family and I perform in order to make a payment each month has become the organising principle of our lives. I am just one of 44 million borrowers in the US who owe a total of more than $1.4 trillion in student loan debt. This number is almost incomprehensibly high, and yet it continues to increase, with no sign of stopping. Legislation that might help families in financial hardship has failed in Congress. A bill introduced in May 2017, the Discharge Student Loans in Bankruptcy Act, which would undo changes made to the bankruptcy code in the early 2000s, stalled in committee. Despite all evidence that student loan debt is a national crisis, the majority of the US government – the only organisation with the power to resolve the problem – refuses to acknowledge its severity.My debt was the result, in equal measure, of a chain of rotten luck and a system that is an abject failure by design. My parents never lived extravagantly. In the first years of their marriage, my father drove a cab. When they had children and my father started a career in the auto industry, we became firmly middle-class, never wanting for anything, even taking vacations once a year, to places like Myrtle Beach or Miami. Still, there was usually just enough money to cover the bills – car leases, a mortgage, groceries. My sister and I both attended public school. The cost of things was discussed constantly. In my freshman year of high school, I lost my yearbook, which cost $40 my mother very nearly wept. College, which cost roughly $50,000 a year, was the only time that money did not seem to matter. “We’ll find a way to pay for it,” my parents said repeatedly, and if we couldn’t pay for it immediately, there was always a bank willing to give us a loan. This was true even after my parents had both lost their jobs amid the global financial meltdown. Like many well-meaning but misguided baby boomers, neither of my parents received an elite education, but they nevertheless believed that an expensive school was not a waste of money it was the key to a better life for their children. They continued to put faith in this falsehood even after a previously unimaginable financial loss, and so we continued spending money that we didn’t have – money that banks kept giving to us.I have spent a great deal of time during the last decade shifting the blame for my debt. Whose fault was it? My devoted parents, for encouraging me to attend a school they couldn’t afford? The banks, which should have never lent money to people who clearly couldn’t pay it back to begin with, continuously exploiting the hope of families like mine, and quick to exploit us further once that hope disappeared? Or was it my fault for not having the foresight to realise it was a mistake to spend roughly $200,000 on a school where, in order to get my degree, I kept a journal about reading Virginia Woolf? (Sample passage, which assuredly blew my mind at the time: “We are interested in facts because we are interested in myth. We are interested in myth insofar as myth constructs facts.”) The problem, I think, runs deeper than blame. The foundational myth of an entire generation of Americans was the false promise that education was priceless – that its value was above or beyond its cost. College was not a right or a privilege, but an inevitability on the way to a meaningful adulthood. What an irony that the decisions I made about college when I was 17 have derailed such a goal.After the dust settled on the collapse of the economy, on my family’s lives, we found ourselves in an impossible situation: we owed more each month than we could collectively pay. And so we wrote letters to Citibank’s mysterious PO box address in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, begging for help, letters that I doubt ever met a human being. We grew to accept Citibank as a detestable Moloch that we feared and hated, but were made to worship. The letters began to comprise a diary for my father in particular, a way to communicate a private anguish that he mostly bottled up, as if he was storing it for later. In one letter, addressed “Dear Citi,” he pleaded for a longer-term plan with lower monthly payments. He described how my mother’s mounting medical bills, as well as Chase Bank’s collection on our foreclosed home, had forced the family into bankruptcy, which provided no protection in the case of private student loans. We were not asking, in the end, for relief or forgiveness, but merely to pay them an amount we could still barely afford. “This is an appeal to Citi asking you to work with us on this loan,” he wrote to no one at all.Finally, at the beginning of 2012, my father started writing to the office of Congressman Joseph Crowley, who represented the district in the Bronx where my parents had relocated. In one of these letters, he described watching Too Big to Fail, an HBO film about the financial crisis, which had come out several months earlier. (My parents lost every asset they had, but they still subscribed to HBO, which became more than TV for them – a symbolic relic of their former class status.)The recession was over, officially anyway, and people who had not suffered its agonies were already profiting from its memory. Recession films often took place in the gleaming offices of hedge funds and investment banks, with attractive celebrities offering sympathetic portrayals of economists and bankers – Zachary Quinto, in 2011’s Margin Call, for instance, plays a rocket scientist turned risk analyst with a heart of gold, a do-gooder who discovers that his employer has leveraged itself to the edge of bankruptcy. These films often depicted figures who experienced little to no repercussions for their roles in leading the country into a recession, who abused the misfortune of people like my parents – unmentionables who owed more on their houses than what they had paid for them and, of course, rarely featured in the story at all.My father described himself and my mother to Crowley as “the poster children for this entire financial event”, by which he meant Americans who seemed to have done everything right on paper, but in doing so contributed to their own downfall. By the time he wrote to Crowley, my father was working again, but it had taken him two years to find another job, which paid him much less money. After his run of financial calamity, he knew better than to believe anything good would last. “We are in our 60s and I figure when we get to our mid-70s life will become difficult again,” he wrote.Crowley’s office wrote back. It was the first time in about two years that a person had responded to our correspondence with encouragement, or something like it. Someone who worked for his office in Washington helped to arrange a conference call with government liaisons from Citigroup to discuss a different payment plan. The monthly payments to Citi were then more than $800 a month, and we were trying to talk them into letting us pay the loan over a longer period, at a rate of about $400 a month. These terms were reasonable enough, but the response to this request was like an automated message brought to life: “We are precluded from a regulatory perspective from being able to do what you are asking,” each of the representatives said. What made these exchanges more ridiculous was the fact that Citibank was in the process of retreating from the student loan market by selling off my debt to Discover Financial, who would give us the same response. We were nothing to these companies but a number in a database. And they fully controlled our fates.I used to wonder if the people who worked for these lenders had families of their own, and if they would ever find themselves bankrupt, wondering where they were going to live. Most of all, I wondered what they would do if their own children had to take out loans to pay for college. After 10 years of living with the fallout of my own decisions about my education, I have come to think of my debt as like an alcoholic relative from whom I am estranged, but who shows up to ruin happy occasions. But when I first got out of school and the reality of how much money I owed finally struck me, the debt was more of a constant and explicit preoccupation, a matter of life and death.I had studied English because I wanted to be a writer. I never had an expectation of becoming rich. I didn’t care about money. My MA fed an intellectual curiosity that eventually led me to newspapers, and I don’t regret that my translation of The Dream of the Rood from Old English to contemporary vernacular was not a terribly marketable or even applicable skill. I understand now the extent to which I was among the most overeducated group of young adults in human history. Still, following completion of this degree, I enrolled for an evening class in French at New York’s Cooper Union, as that deferred my having to start paying off the debt, and the cost of the new class was cheaper than the monthly repayments I would have to make. Once I could no longer delay and the payments began, a question echoed through my head from the moment the day began, and often jolted me awake at night. I would look at the number on my paycheck and obsessively subtract my rent, the cost of a carton of eggs and a can of beans (my sustenance during the first lean year of this mess), and the price of a loan payment. The question was: What will you do when the money from the paycheck is gone?I never arrived at an answer to this question. At my lowest points, I began fantasising about dying, not because I was suicidal, but because death would have meant relief from having to come up with an answer. My life, I felt, had been assigned a monetary value – I knew what I was worth, and I couldn’t afford it, so all the better to cash out early. The debt was mind-controlling – how I would eat or pay my rent without defaulting was a constant refrain, and I had long since abandoned any hope of a future in which I might have a meaningful line of credit or a disposable income, or even simply own something – but it was also mind-numbingly banal. I spent a great deal of time filling out paperwork over and over again, or waiting on hold for extended periods in order to speak to a robotic voice that would reject my request. It didn’t matter what the request was or who I was asking. It was always rejected.And so it felt good to think about dying, in the way that it felt good to take a long nap in order to not be conscious for a while. These thoughts culminated in November 2010, when I met with my father one afternoon at a diner in Brooklyn to retrieve more paperwork. My hope for some forgiving demise had resulted in my being viciously sick for about 10 days, with what turned out to be strep throat. I refused to go to the doctor in the hope that my condition might worsen into a more serious infection that, even if it didn’t kill me, might force someone to at last lavish me with pity. I coughed up a not insignificant portion of yellowish fluid before my father and I entered the restaurant. We sat at a table, and I frowned at the forms he handed me. I started the conversation by asking, “Theoretically, if I were to, say, kill myself, what would happen to the debt?”“I would have to pay it myself,” my father said, in the same tone he would use a few minutes later to order eggs. He paused and then offered me a melancholy smile, which I sensed had caused him great strain. “Listen, it’s just debt,” he said. “No one is dying from this.”My father had suffered in the previous two years. In a matter of months, he had lost everything he had worked most of his adult life to achieve – first his career, then his home, then his dignity. He had become a 60-year-old man who had quite reluctantly shaved his greying, 40-year-old mustache in order to look younger, shuffling between failed job interviews where he was often told he had “too much experience”. He was ultimately forced out of the life he’d known, dragging with him, like some 21-first-century Pa Joad, a U-Haul trailer crammed with family possessions, including, at the insistence of my mother, large plastic tubs of my childhood action figures.Throughout this misery, my father had reacted with what I suddenly realised was stoicism, but which I had long mistaken for indifference. This misunderstanding was due in part to my mother, whom my father mercifully hadn’t lost, and who had suffered perhaps most of all. Not that it was a competition, but if it were, I think she would have taken some small amount of satisfaction in winning it. The loss of home and finances felt at least like a worthy opponent for cancer, and yet here was my father telling me that none of this was the end of the world. I felt a flood of sympathy for him. I was ashamed of my selfishness. The lump in my throat began to feel less infectious than lachrymal. “OK,” I said to him, and that was that. When I got home I scheduled an appointment with a doctor.Navient released a public statement in reponse to that suit, which said: “There is no expectation that the servicer will act in the interest of the consumer.” When I received a notice from Navient in February 2017 that my monthly payments would be increasing, for reasons I did not comprehend, the email came with a note at the bottom saying: “We’re here to help: We’re happy to help you navigate your options, provide you with resources, and answer any questions you have as you repay your loans.” The company’s motto is, hilariously, “Solutions for your success”.These announcements flooded my inbox with subject lines declaring “Important Information”, but none of them altered my fate. Sometimes the monthly payments would go up, sometimes my salary would go up, sometimes I made a cheque out to a different company. The only stable thing was the money I owed, which never seemed to get any lower. And so the cash would go out to the various lenders with the blind hope that it was right. On top of all that was a dreadful anticipation that any day now I might hear from the credit bureau and my life would somehow bottom out.In some twisted way, I wanted it to happen. My mother’s cancer went into remission, and both of my parents found, in their 60s, new careers in New York. I maintained steady employment in journalism since finishing school, and in 2016 I was hired as an editor at the New York Times. Was it possible we had become lucky? I had spent so much time wondering what life’s nadir looked like that I was now curious whether it had already come and gone.In the summer of 2017, my father, now nearing 70, had lost another job, so I finally removed him as a guarantor and refinanced my loans with one of the few companies that provides such a service, SoFi. My wife, who agreed to marry me last autumn, would help with the payments when she could. Sharing the burden of my debt with my spouse instead of my parents was a small, depressing victory, a milestone perhaps unique to members of my generation, one that must have carried the same kind of significance that purchasing a home and having a mortgage had to my parents.SoFi has not made my situation much more tenable. The main difference is that I now write one cheque instead of several, and I have an end date for when the debt, including the calculated interest – about $182,000 – will be paid off: 2032, when I’ll be 44, a number that feels only slightly less theoretical to me than 30 did when I was 17. What I have to pay each month is still, for the most part, more than I am able to afford, and it has kept me in a state of perpetual childishness. I rely on the help of people I love, and I live by each paycheck. I still harbour anxiety about the bad things that could befall me should the paycheck disappear.But the “Important Information” I receive has changed. SoFi is a Silicon Valley startup that bills itself as “a new kind of finance company” its name is shorthand for Social Finance, Inc. In addition to loans, it offers membership outreach in the form of financial literacy workshops and free dinners. Their aim is to “empower our members” – a mission that was called into question by the resignation, in September 2017, of its CEO, Mike Cagney, who employees allege had engaged in serial workplace sexual harassment and who ran the office, according to a New York Times headline, like “a frat house.” The allegations, according to a report in the Times, include Cagney exchanging explicit text messages with employees, bragging about the size of his genitalia, and the company’s chief financial officer offering bonuses to female employees if they lost weight. In January, SoFi hired Anthony Noto, formerly of Twitter, as Cagney’s replacement.SoFi has also received criticism for its elitism, and for courting only wealthy, high-earning borrowers – to which I can only say this is a category with which I do not personally identify, especially after writing the check to SoFi each month. The news ahout Cagney came out not long after I refinanced my loans with the company – I became, I suppose, a SoFi’er, in the company’s parlance. Around the same time, I started receiving curious emails from them: “You’re Invited: 2 NYC Singles Events” or “Come Celebrate Pride with us!”I will reiterate that I am a 30-year-old married man with more than $100,000 of debt, who makes less each year than what he owes. Buying a pair of trousers is a major financial decision for me. I do not think myself eligible in any sense of the word, nor do I find my debt to be amusing merely on a conversational level.Still, I felt as if in 10 years, the debt hadn’t changed, but the world had, or at least the world’s view of it. This thing, this 21st-century blight that had been the source of great ruin and sadness for my family, was now so normal – so basic – that it had been co-opted by the wellness industry of Silicon Valley. My debt was now approachable, a way to meet people. It was, in other words, an investment in my future, which is why I had gone into debt in the first place. Would SoFi be this friendly if I lost my job and missed a monthly payment?Let’s say I was morbidly intrigued. The day after Valentine’s Day, I went to a Mexican restaurant in the financial district for a SoFi community dinner – this was not a singles event, but simply a free meal. There had been another of these dinners near my apartment the week before, but it had, to my surprise, quickly sold out. The restaurant was packed with an after-work crowd in business attire, and SoFi had rented out the back room, where a few dozen people had gathered, all wearing name tags and discussing financial woes. Sid, a software developer from Queens who had racked up credit card debt after college, told me that the debt was a unifying force at these gatherings. “When there’s a break in the conversation, someone can just say, ‘So, debt, huh?’ and things will get going again,” he said. “If we walked outside of this room,” he continued, gesturing to the suits by the bar, “everyone out there would have debt, too. It’s just a little more out in the open for us.”Despite the name tags, the dinner turned out to resemble something more like an AA meeting, an earnest session of group therapy. Everyone had their story about the problems caused by their student loans and how they were trying, one day at a time, to improve things, and no story was exceptional, including my own. Ian, an employee for Google who had recently successfully paid off his debt from a Columbia MBA programme, became something like my sponsor for the evening. He said he had a few “bone dry” years, when he lived on instant noodles. I told him I had a long way to go. “At least you’re doing something about it,” he said, sincerely.We sat down to dinner. Across from me was Mira, a defence attorney from Brooklyn, who attended law school at Stanford. Her payments amount to $2,300 a month, more than double my own. When I asked her why she came to this event, she glanced at me as if the answer should have been obvious: her payments are $2,300 a month. The table, myself included, looked on her with an odd reverence. She wore a business suit and had her hair pulled back, but I saw her as something like the sage and weathered biker of the group, talking in her wisdom about accepting the things you cannot change.After the food was served, a waiter came by with a stack of to-go boxes, which sat on the edge of the table untouched for a while as everyone cautiously eyed them. The group was reluctant at first, but then Ian said, “The chicken was actually pretty good,” as he scooped it into one of the boxes. Mira shrugged, took a fork, and said: “This is a little tacky, but I’d hate to waste free food,” and the rest of the table followed her lead. Maybe the next generation would do better, but I felt like we were broke and broken. No number of degrees or professional successes would put us back together again. For now, though, we knew where our next meal was coming from.This article first appeared in the current issue of the Baffler• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/f92934931c54af2bbfd9530a21678c1c375d6a8e/0_0_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00fe3106cc59c091acc5f9e1eb1b5981","title":"call for two years further freedom of movement after brexit","story":"Thinktank warns of labour shortages in London and the south-east without an EU dealBritain would face labour shortages in London and the south-east from a no-deal Brexit, according to a report calling for the government to extend freedom of movement for EU migrants to protect the wider economy.The Centre for Cities thinktank urged the government to extend freedom of movement for two years after the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019, in the event of no deal on the terms of exit and future relations with the union.Publishing a report on EU citizens working in British towns and cities across the country, the Centre for Cities warned cities such as Oxford, Cambridge and London, where the vote was in favour of remaining in the EU, are reliant on EU migrants, making them particularly vulnerable to tougher immigration rules should Britain crash out without a deal.The report said about one in 10 employees in major southern cities were from the EU. It said they had brought with them “significant economic benefits” to the wider British economy, which could be put at risk from a no-deal Brexit.The report comes ahead of the government’s publication of a series of technical notices detailing the impact of a no-deal Brexit.Suggesting the impact would be more complex and spread across the country, the report said many remain-voting metropolitan centres required continued access to the EU for low-skilled hospitality workers, as well as highly qualified professional services staff.Supporters of Brexit have repeatedly argued that EU migrants make it harder for British workers to find work. However the thinktank said losing them would raise questions over the ability of cities to prosper. It said many of the most productive places in the UK had higher proportions of EU workers.EU migration has slumped since the referendum, suggesting the UK has already become less attractive for many European workers. The report found migration from the rest of the EU has dropped in 51 out of 58 English and Welsh cities since before the referendum was held two years ago.The report called on the government to allow temporary visas for low-skilled workers, and scrap arbitrary restrictions on high-skilled workers. It also said there should be more government funding for training and education in cities to help address skills shortages in the long-term.Although ministers have committed to continued free movement during a two-year transition period until the end of 2020, failure to reach a deal with Brussels before the end of March could throw that into doubt."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a9beaadc95fbcdfed6562bb6335e82834863448/0_0_5940_3565/master/5940.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45612af2e1bef010af5895d05828c6c4","title":"labour given 10m more than tories last year says electoral commission","story":"Jeremy Corbyn’s party brought in a record £55.8m in 2017, says Electoral CommissionLabour raised nearly £10m more than the Conservatives last year, in what is thought to be the largest amount received over 12 months by a political party.Jeremy Corbyn’s party was given £55.8m in 2017, while the Tories managed to raise £45.9m, also their highest total, as both parties financed general election campaigns.However, Conservative income from membership fees slumped from £1.46m to £835,000 in a year, while Labour received £16m from membership subscriptions, according to the data, an increase of £2m from the previous year.The figures were released on Wednesday morning by the Electoral Commission, the donations watchdog, which found that 10 parties reported having gross income or total expenditure of more than £250,000 in 2017. In total, these parties reported £125,322,000 in income and £122,194,000 of expenditure.Labour beat its previous highest amount of £51m, which was raised in 2015, also a general election year, but one that was fought under Ed Miliband. The Tories’ second-highest amount raised in a year came in 2010, when donors gave £43.1m.Labour also received £18m in donations from its members, while Conservative members gave £34m, the data showed.The figures also showed the Tories received £1.7m from legacies, twice as much as Labour.Even Corbyn’s critics have been surprised by the way his popularity has turned around the party’s funding model.

He is interested in the impact of austerity, universal credit, the advent of computer algorithms making decisions on welfare matters, and Brexit.Anyone taking part has been asked to set out in no more than 2,500 words what is happening, where he should go and what he should look at. He has set a deadline of 14 September for submissions and academics, thinktanks and charities are among those drafting responses.The visit is set to be politically controversial. Alston conducted a similar exercise in the US earlier this year, which resulted in public clashes with the Trump administration. In the UK, he wants to know “to what extent austerity has been necessary” and its impact on public services including police, firefighting and libraries. He will also consider how Brexit might affect people living in poverty. Alston defines extreme poverty as “a lack of income, a lack of access to basic services, and social exclusion”.The government has already said in response that household incomes “have never been higher and there are 1 million fewer people living in absolute poverty than in 2010, including 300,000 children”.The Centre for Social Justice, a right-leaning thinktank founded by Iain Duncan Smith, who set up universal credit as work and pensions secretary, said said it will not make a submission.“Universal credit is one of the most effective poverty-fighting tools in existence,” said Edward Davies, the head of policy. “When it is fully rolled out, hundreds of thousands more people will have a job as a result.”Tiffin’s diary of life on universal credit is among the most striking contributions so far. The wheelchair user told Alston he is living off £95.35 a fortnight in universal credit payments and that after paying for his electricity and gas, fuel for his adapted car, broadband connection, TV licence and baby milk for his youngest son, he is left with £10.50 for two weeks.“At one time in February, I had no food at all for two weeks,” he wrote. “I probably ate on less than a quarter of the days in that month. I just had nothing. I lost two and a half stone … my hair has started falling out and my teeth are loose due to a lack of vitamin intake.”Tiffin has suffered from mental health problems. He is a Muslim convert and was recently admonished by a court for threatening to kill unbelievers. Police considered he was “an idiot” rather than a terrorist and he was not punished. He said the incident occurred when he was going through a complete breakdown. Human Rights Watch, an organisation more often associated with defending rights in countries such as Russia, China, Syria, and India, is planning to tell Alston about food poverty in the UK.“There is a lot of hunger that goes under the radar, ranging from parents skipping meals, kids showing up to school hungry, and schools and families relying on low-cost, redistributed surplus food to make ends meet,” said Kartik Raj, a HRW researcher for western Europe. “People have a right to food and an adequate standard of living. These are human rights the government is obliged to ensure under international treaties it has signed. If the fifth largest economy in the world is failing to ensure that basic minimum, or letting things get worse, particularly for those who are least well off, then that is certainly something we will be bringing to the rapporteur’s attention.”“Destitution cuts off your ability to have a decent life and affects mental and physical health and the opportunities for you and your children in the future,” said the Chris Goulden, a deputy director of the JRF.Aoife Nolan, a professor of international human rights law at the University of Nottingham, said: “The key issue he has to come and see is welfare reform, deliberate actions which have negatively impacted the enjoyment of human rights for disabled people and children in particular.”The right to an adequate standard of living is enshrined in the UN convention on the rights of the child and, Nolan said, it is being breached because these rights were not being extended as they should and minimum thresholds are being breached.The government has said it is its policy to accept and facilitate visits by UN rapporteurs."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/047a2825d4abe52ec9b347d84ae834f65e267ddd/0_81_3723_2234/master/3723.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e59936930452203dedd7cb8ffc96145","title":"india end englands resistance in only 17 balls to win third test by 203 runs trent bridge","story":"In front of a surprisingly large crowd of around 500, who were allowed free entry, it took 17 balls and a cunning Ravichandran Ashwin leg-break to polish off the England innings and give India a resounding victory by 203 runs in the third Test.The two sides shook hands and packed their bags eager for a few days’ respite before Joe Root and Virat Kohli toss up again at the Ageas Bowl on 30August. The series is alive and Indian confidence is restored, though Root was right to point out amid the doom-mongering about the fragility of his side’s batting that England are currently 2-1 up in a series against the side deemed to be the best in the world in the ICC rankings.The Test team is not in freefall but it remains, most definitely, a work in progress. Improvements and changes are needed and the task facing Ed Smith and his selectors before the next Test is not entirely straightforward. However Smith likes a puzzle, intellectual or otherwise, and so far this summer he has been coming up with some intriguing solutionsIn fact selecting the squad for Southampton will not be the difficult bit choosing the final eleven will. So there is the opportunity for Smith and James Taylor to do some buck-passing. They can present Trevor Bayliss and Root with every possible option and then leave them to it at the Ageas Bowl.In essence the panel has one major decision to make and it relates to the opening pair. Are they prepared to change it again? If they are - and the figures suggest this might be a good idea - does Alastair Cook or Keaton Jennings go? Almost certainly the answer would be Jennings. A nasty pattern has emerged among the batsmen recently tried by England. As they lose confidence amid the greater intensity of Test cricket they start dropping catches. This happened to James Vince, Mark Stoneman and Dawid Malan now this problem seems to be afflicting Jennings as well - though Cook is not without blemishes in this department either.The next opener on the rank is Surrey’s Rory Burns, an ungainly but effective left-hander. Burns’ left-handedness does not help because Ishant Sharma relishes bowling to this type of batsman but where are the right-handed opening batsmen? If the selectors are in proactive mood, and there are signs that this how Ed Smith prefers to operate, then Burns may be drafted in for Jennings. However one should banish any notion that Cook has earnt the right to choose the timing of his departure. That should not be the case. Of course, the selectors are entitled to drop him, even though this has never happened in his 12-year career.There may well be an old-fashioned feel to the selectors’ deliberations. They will meet at an extraordinary time, namely when there is actually some first-class cricket going on in the shires. So there is the rare possibility of picking players who are in peak form against a red ball. In fact Moeen Ali, who has just produced an herculean performance at Scarborough while captaining Worcestershire to victory - a double century and eight wickets in the match against Yorkshire - was already in the Test squad for Trent Bridge so too was Sam Curran. That is unlikely to happen. So pursuing the principle of studying the form and the imminent venue then the name of James Vince surfaces immediately, even though such a reversion might prompt some grimaces. Vince has had an excellent season he has just scored 74 and 147 against Nottinghamshire at the Ageas Bowl. Like Moeen he is on the crest of a wave. Modern panels like to stick to patterns of selection rather than be too easily swayed by current form but in this instance the impetus to play Moeen in the team and to include Vince in the squad seems irresistible.So there are almost a bewildering number of options available to Bayliss and Root at the Ageas Bowl even after assuming that the inclusion of Essex’s Jamie Porter is no longer necessary. England could play Moeen with Adil Rashid or instead of him. If Vince was recalled, perhaps Root could revert to number four and Ollie Pope might drop down the order - or even out of the team. Could Stuart Broad, to use the politest of terms, be rotated with Sam Curran coming back into the side? Too many changes suggest instability, but that may simply be a reflection of where this team currently sits.To arrest panic let me borrow yet another statistic from Test Match Special’s scorer, Andrew Sansom, about changes to Test teams. Between 1931 and 1948 England did not play the same side once in consecutive Test matches (there were 74 of them in that period). Feel better now?"},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/662ddcff4a4d3b21e958a66a5780a99353612311/0_142_2631_1579/master/2631.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fccdf7513c5844332f58730b90b3eacf","title":"andy murray ivan lendl alexander zverev us open","story":"Coach tempted out of retirement by prospect of working with 21-year-old German while creaking Murray returns to US Open as an almost invisible former championWhen Andy Murray hooked up with Ivan Lendl eight years ago, he seemed convinced that, after several experiments with other coaches, he and old Rock Jaw would be together for the rest of his career. Within a year, he had broken through for an Olympic gold medal and his first grand slam title at the US Open. Two Wimbledon titles would follow – then injury, struggle and no little angst.When Murray arrived in New York this week to prepare for the US Open, the last major of the season, he may have experienced a shiver of regret, or nostalgia maybe, when he learned Lendl had come out of retirement to tend to the development of the exciting young German Alexander Zverev. Murray would hardly be human if he did not at least wonder how it may have panned out during his own difficult stretches had Lendl not walked away – twice.Lendl and Murray long ago put their emotional split to one side. The coach went off to play a lot of golf and the player found contentment with his old friend, Jamie Delgado, who has bolstered his long-time back-up team. He has new challenges now. Murray is 31, still managing the drawn out recovery of his chronic hip pain and looking up the rankings rather than down, at 378 in the world, as 21-year-old Zverev consolidates his position near the top of the game at No 4.Zverev has promised a lot – three Masters titles – without grabbing the biggest prize but he has the game to scare everyone in the field. It would be a disappointment if he did not reach the final weekend for Murray, getting into the second week would be a considerable achievement.Were the unseeded Murray and fancied Zverev to meet in the first round, it would be a collision even more electric than when the former world No 1 beat Tomas Berdych in the 2015 Australian Open semi-final. That night his wife, Kim, swore dutifully in his defence as Murray’s former mentor, Dani Vallverdu, sat in the Czech’s box. What added spice to the occasion was the fact Berdych had tapped up Lendl to coach him, only to be turned down.So much has changed since then for all of them. Berdych (who made up with Murray) is not here this year, out injured again at the tail end of his career. Murray, places below Dan Evans in the rankings, is flying so far under the radar Roger Federer did not mention the three-times grand slam champion when discussing whom he regarded as the main contenders.As Federer sees it in the first grand slam tournament featuring the big four since Wimbledon 2017, the defending champion and No 1 seed Rafael Nadal, and the former champion Novak Djokovic, who beat the Swiss in the Cincinnati Open final, are the two to beat. He does not sound that confident about his own game, which soared and dipped during the warm-up tournament before his bankable return of serve collapsed against Djokovic on Sunday.Murray returns to New York an almost invisible champion, which may be the way he prefers it. Since his return from injury this summer, he has struggled to assert himself. When he looked to have conquered his own misgivings about his fitness, he then faltered on the eve of Wimbledon, unconvinced he could survive a five-set match.He still is not sure if he can – which is why he should have played there, although he is convinced he made the right decision. After winning a few matches on grass, Murray has had tough examinations in Washington – where he withdrew after winning three matches – and in Cincinnati, where Lucas Pouille was too good for him in the first round.Djokovic, who limped away from Wimbledon with Murray in the quarter-finals in 2017, has been considerably rejuvenated since winning there on his return this summer, then in Cincinnati. When Nadal, perennially worried about his knees and hip, decided to skip Cincinnati to get ready for Flushing Meadows he sent out a signal of doubt Djokovic will surely start favourite.The British have not had many successes in New York since they beat George Washington in 1776, and this year may be little different. Kyle Edmund is the only seed, at 16. Johanna Konta, who has fallen from four in the world a year ago to 46, is the only other British player in the tournament by right – and she pulled out of the Connecticut Open this week with a virus.Edmund, though, is on an upswing. Bjorn Borg, no less, celebrated his addition to Team Europe for the three-day Laver Cup in Chicago in late September with some glowing words.“Kyle is an outstanding young player who’s achieved some great results and big wins over top players,” he said. “I’m impressed with his meticulous and methodical approach to the sport and believe he will be a great fit with the team.”Europe, with Federer, Djokovic and Edmund on board, should be too strong for the weirdly named Team World – even without Nadal.The Spaniard declared as long ago as June he was making the Davis Cup semi-final against France the week before a priority over the fledgling Laver Cup, the Ryder Cup-style brainchild of Federer in honour of Rod Laver.This is the face of modern tennis towards the end of an intriguing summer: iniduals torn between personal glory (and money) and national obligations. With the ATP’s own team competition slated to start in 2020, it will only become more complicated."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/21ad7f3cb7166056b3edd32e1512e782e5ed0c09/0_223_3232_1939/master/3232.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfadf48b12ece52ed14e2fa319912dcb","title":"talking horses best bets for day one of yorks ebor meeting","story":"Cross Counter is surely the one to be with in the Voltigeur, while Poet’s Word can land a hot-looking Juddmonte InternationalMuch as I love taking a swing at a big-priced runner, the bet that appeals to me most on the opening day of York’s Ebor meeting is Cross Counter (3.00) at 13-8 for the Great Voltigeur. This is despite the slightly upsetting experience of napping his half-sister yesterday and seeing her finish out of the frame. The Gordon Stakes that he won at Glorious Goodwood is not always a strong race and there were only four runners this year. The runner-up, Dee Ex Bee, was also runner-up in the Derby but he has had a suspiciously hard time actually winning a race.\u0026nbspStill, Cross Counter put up a strong performance against the clock that day and it was not an effort that came out of a blue sky he’d been building towards a big run all summer. I like that he coped so well with making most of the running but he doesn’t have to do that and I don’t think he will today.\u0026nbspWhen Kew Gardens won the Grand Prix de Paris, I did not expect to be taking him on the next time he ran. But Aidan O’Brien has had his problems since then, with a bug seemingly sweeping through the yard, and of course this one has to shoulder a 5lb penalty for having won a Group One. If Cross Counter is also Group One-quality, that’s asking a lot of Kew Gardens.\u0026nbspYou’ve always got to fear a Yorkshire horse in a Yorkshire race and Wells Farhh Go looked awfully good at Newmarket last time. Front-running made a difference to him that day, so I expect we’ll see the same again but it may not work so well over a shorter trip against better rivals.\u0026nbspAt 66-1, Zabriskie is being written off but I shall have an each-way interest. Wells Farhh Go was among those behind him when he was a running-on third in the Dante at this very course and of course he is sexily bred, as a Frankel half-brother to an Arc winner, Bago. All you have to do is put a line through his Derby run, and I can always forgive a bad run at Epsom. Mind you, Zabriskie’s effort that day was cover-your-eyes awful.\u0026nbspPoet’s Word (3.35) is the pick in the big race, for reasons explained here. I see there’s some fretting about where the pace is going to come from. I’m expecting Thunder Snow and maybe Benbatl to be to the fore. I don’t think they’ll go mad but it should be a respectable pace that will allow Poet’s Word to show his class in the straight. I don’t think he’s a slow horse in any case. He’s also 13-8.\u0026nbspHolmeswood (1.55) has attracted support at 9-1 for the opening sprint handicap. It’s not the sort of race I ever feel confident about but there’s a strong case for him running well and those odds are still fair, for me.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/f53d86493c89d5160c38869f45ca7c238948b88f/0_102_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a865d96c202ae9e8b451269192debf8","title":"county cricket yorkshire v worcs surrey v lancashire and more live","story":"Lancashire are seven down at the Oval.

Lancashire are whittling down their target at the Oval. At 188-5, they now just need 83 to win. What a game Josh Bohannon is having. A determined and diminutive batting all-rounder from Bolton, Bohannon has added an unbeaten 28 to his first-innings fifty on debut. He has shared 64 and counting with Steven Croft for the sixth wicket. Not a bad week to do it in given the Red Rose have lost Jordan Clark to Surrey! Result at the Ageas Bowl: Hampshire have beaten Nottinghamshire by 270 runs after getting the final two wickets to leave Notts all out for 240.Some reaction from Worcestershire’s head coach Kevin Sharp to Moeen Ali’s potential return to the Test side: “I think he’s got the bit between his teeth,” he said. “He was very disappointed to be left out, and it wasn’t what he wanted. I have to say he’s taken it on the chin and come back to Worcester. His work ethic has been excellent.“The fact that he’s been left out has really spurred him on to get back into the team.”Hampshire are on the verge of beating Notts at the Ageas Bowl, where the visitors are 209-8 requiring 302 more to win. Kyle Abbott and Liam Dawson have three wickets apiece.Essex look like they have the advantage at Taunton, despite losing Nick Browne and Tom Westley in successive overs. Chasing that 336, they are 213-3. They need 123 more.In Division Two, Derbyshire are 71-2 in pursuit of 405 at Sussex. The best they can hope for is a draw out of that one. Northants have started well in their pursuit of 216 to beat Middlesex at Wantage Road. They are 76-1 with Luke Procter and Ricardo Vasconcelos at the crease.Worcestershire have won by an innings and 186 runs, bowling Yorkshire out for 170 in their second innings. It took just 40 minutes of play this morning for Moeen Ali and Dillon Pennington to strike twice apiece. Worcestershire are now five points behind Yorkshire. Both sides await other results to see exactly where they stand in the Division One table. At Wantage Road, Northants are chasing 216 to beat Middlesex and have reached 13-0 in the early stages of their chase. The last knockings here....Yorkshire are 164-8 with Jack Brooks and Jonny Tattersall trying to resist. Well, I say resist, Brooks is not the sort to hang around. Hang on, he’s just been bowled by Dillon Pennington. I told you he’s not the sort to hang around! 164-9 now. Two wickets already for Moeen Ali, and he has 6-39. David Willey was bowled and Matthew Fisher was caught behind within four balls in the 56th over, the fourth of the morning. Moeen still on for 10 wickets in the match and a double hundred.Good morning from Scarborough, where the sun is shining and we have the best weather of the week. Unfortunately, though, we are due for a pretty short day as Worcestershire need just four wickets to beat Yorkshire (140-6, trailing by 216) to claim their second win of the campaign.Bottom before this game, they could move higher depending on other results at the Oval and the Ageas Bowl. They would be just five points behind Yorkshire with as many games to play. The two meet at New Road in the final round of the season next month. David Willey and Jonny Tattersall will begin the day at the crease hoping for a miracle.If Lancashire manage to complete a surprise win over Surrey at the Oval – they will begin at 1.30pm on 177-5 in their second innings needing 94 more – and Hampshire complete victory over Nottinghamshire, then Yorkshire would be second bottom in Division One.Notts will resume their second innings on 128-4 with 383 more needed for victory. The three results already completed in this round have come in Division Two leaders Warwickshire beating Gloucestershire, Kent winning a key promotion battle with Leicestershire and mid-table Durham beating bottom side Glamorgan.At Hove, Derbyshire are chasing 405 against Sussex, for whom opener Phil Salt scored a magnificent 148 off 138 balls yesterday to turn what looked like being a high-scoring draw into a genuine victory chance for the hosts. Derbyshire reached 6-0 last night and only have nine wickets to play with given Ravi Rampaul is out of the game following breathing problems.At Wantage Road, Middlesex simply have to win to maintain their slim hopes of a late promotion charge, and it looks like being a cracker of a finish against Northants. Middlesex lead by 215 with one second-innings wicket in hand. Some effort from the visitors having been asked to follow-on 259 behind.

The 74 pages, 70 accounts and three groups on Facebook and 76 Instagram accounts – some dating back to 2013 – posted political content focused on the Middle East, UK, US and Latin America. The pages had about 155,000 followers in total. The same group spent more than $6,000 on Facebook and Instagram ads paid for in US dollars, the last one running in August 2018.The cybersecurity company FireEye, which first identified the campaign and flagged the campaign to Facebook, said the intent behind the activity appeared to be to “promote Iranian political interests, including anti-Saudi, anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian themes, as well as promote support for specific US policies favorable to Iran, such as the US-Iran nuclear deal”. There was also significant anti-Trump messaging and the creation of sock puppet accounts masquerading as liberal Americans.FireEye noted that the activity did not appear to have been specifically designed to influence the US midterm elections as the content extended beyond US audiences and politics.The second campaign was linked to the first one and involved 12 pages and 66 accounts on Facebook and nine on Instagram. The inauthentic accounts posed as news organisations and engaged in cybersecurity attacks, including attempting to hack accounts and spread malware.The third Iranian campaign comprised 168 pages and 140 accounts on Facebook, and 31 on Instagram. They collectively hosted 25 events and about 813,000 Facebook users followed at least one of the pages. Facebook said the campaign mostly shared content about Middle East politics in Arabic and Farsi, but also shared content about politics in the UK and US. This group of accounts spent more than $6,000 in ads paid in US dollars, Turkish lira and Indian rupees between July 2012 and April 2018.Facebook was most vague about the fourth and final campaign, a collection of pages, groups and accounts linked to the Russian military intelligence services – with no links to the Iranian campaigns. These included some of the same bad actors removed before the 2016 US election, but the focus of their recent activity was spreading pro-Russia messaging relating to Syria and Ukraine.“To date, we have not found activity by these accounts targeting the US,” said Nathaniel Gleicher, head of cybersecurity policy.Facebook would not provide any more information about the nature of the Iranian and Russian content, but said that it had briefed the US and UK governments.“These investigations are ongoing – and given the sensitivity we aren’t sharing more information about what we removed,” Gleicher said.Today’s announcement comes less than a month after the social network deleted 32 pages and accounts attempting to influence the US midterm elections. The accounts pushed American political stances and organised events, including a protest against a Unite the Right rally in Washington.Facebook could not conclusively attribute the campaign to Russia, but said that the accounts showed “similar activity” and connections to other accounts associated with the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/692b8df040a697df4909df4647405bb9a37e62fe/0_0_4263_2558/master/4263.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3957d943a4eeac0af238e0790b40764c","title":"samsung galaxy note 9 review phone bluetooth s pen","story":"The phablet’s massive, beautiful screen, excellent performance and new Bluetooth stylus will have Note fans salivatingThe king of the big, powerful phones is back for another generation, but is the new Samsung Galaxy Note 9 still the phablet to beat?The Note series pioneered the big-screen smartphone in 2011 and over the last seven years it has been made larger and more feature-packed with each new version.

The Note has always been Samsung’s showcase for its best screen technology.The massive screen does have its downsides, though, as it makes the Note 9 fairly difficult to handle without two hands. If any phone would benefit from a ring or finger grip on the back, this is it. Samsung should have included a hand strap like the ones that came with phones in the early 2000s. It could sit next to the headphone jack.Like the Galaxy S9, the Note 9 has a different processor, depending on where you buy it. The European model has Samsung’s own Exynos 9810 chip and was the version tested, while the North American model has Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 845 processor, which is used in the OnePlus 6 and other top-end phones released in 2018. Performance should be similar between the two versions, although there may be discrepancies at the extremes.The Note 9 is arguably the best performing Android device on the market, and is capable of maintaining that maximum performance for much longer without overheating, which was very noticeable in Shadowgun Legends compared with a Pixel 2XL or OnePlus 6.That was while using the Note 9 as my primary device with the always-on display active, while browsing and using apps for five hours with well over a hundred notifications, reading comics in Marvel Unlimited for 60 minutes, and listening to about five hours of music via Bluetooth headphones.For comparison, Huawei’s 6in Mate 10 Pro can last two full days between charges under similar conditions. It’s possible that the North American version of the Note 9 with the Qualcomm processor may have longer battery life.The Note 9 runs the latest version of Samsung’s modified Android called Samsung Experience 9.5. It’s based on Android 8.1 Oreo instead of the recently released Android 9 Pie, which is disappointing but not entirely unexpected.It looks and behaves similarly to the Note 8 or Galaxy S9+ with Samsung Experience 9. There are a few useful additions for the stylus and large screen, such as the pop-out Edge apps, advanced split-screen multitasking and the ability to pop-out apps to run as windows over others – all features present in the Note 8.On the whole the software on the Note 9 feels like Samsung’s best optimised yet, with smoother performance all round. It’s not quite as snappy as a OnePlus 6 or Google’s Pixel 2XL, but it feels as if Samsung has done a better job of limiting lag all over the system.The dual-camera system on the back is the same as that fitted to the Galaxy S9+. Two 12-megapixel cameras, one wide angle with dual aperture and the other a 2x telephoto camera.New for the Note 9 is an AI system for optimising scenes for shots, which worked fine when it recognised objects such as food and plants, but often created oversaturated images that look like they’ve been put through an Instagram filters. I turned it off and got better results. The AI is also meant to spot when the image is blurry or your subject has their eyes closed, but I couldn’t get it to alert me no matter how many shots of friends blinking I took.Lacklustre AI elements aside, the camera is brilliant, capturing a rich amount of detail, even with the telephoto lens, and in a range of lighting conditions. Low light performance was excellent too, as was the 8-megapixel selfie camera.Another new addition is a Bluetooth-enabled S Pen, which uses a supercapacitor to operate the S Pen away from the phone for up to 30 minutes or so. Slide the S Pen back into the body for a full charge in 40 seconds.Other than the usual scribbling on screen, you can now press the button to trigger actions on your phone, such as taking a picture in the camera app, pausing music or presenting the next slide in PowerPoint. Hold down the button and you can launch an app too.I didn’t find it overly useful, but I know that the feature has been on the wish lists of Note users for some time.If you need your phone to be able to do just about anything, the Note 9 is it. It has everything and the kitchen sink wrapped up into a massive powerhouse of a phone.As you might expect that comes with a few compromises, the biggest of which is the sheer size of the thing making it quite difficult to pocket and handle. It also costs a lot, although not quite as much as Apple’s significantly smaller iPhone X.The camera is great, the screen is amazing, the stylus useful and the myriad features don’t get in the way if you don’t use all of them. You can game for longer at maximum performance than other phones and even use it as a workable light desktop when hooked up to a monitor.The battery life is good but should be better given the size of the cell, and launching after the release of a new version of Android 9 Pie but running last year’s 8.1 Oreo isn’t ideal.The Note 9 really isn’t that much different than the Note 8, but is a huge step forward over older models. Note fans should be happy.Pros: good battery, impressive screen, water resistant, brilliant camera, Bluetooth S Pen, microSD card slot, wireless charging, lasting performance, DeX without the dock, headphone jackCons: only Android 8.1, expensive, very big for hands and pockets, fingerprint scanner should be lower down the back, Bixby still not good enough This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

That’s why it is in.”The new series begins next Tuesday with 12 amateur bakers, including a Bollywood-loving banker, a chatty nuclear scientist and a down-to-earth supermarket product demonstrator competing for the crown.In previous series, in among the regular biscuit, cake and bread weeks there has been a caramel week, a botanicals week and a Victorian week. For the ninth series there will be, for the first time, a Danish week and a vegan week.Both Hollywood and his fellow judge, Prue Leith, said they had learned a lot from the vegan experience. “If you are a vegan or you’re thinking about it and are just worried about how it is going to change your life, watch it and see,” said Hollywood. “It fascinated me, totally … shocked me as well.”He said the judging used the same criteria as any other week. “You can’t judge it and say it’s okay for vegan, it’s got to taste good, period. That’s how we judged it and we were surprised.”The show is in its second year of being on Channel 4 after it poached the programme from the BBC by offering more money. Despite fears it would not work as it was quintessentially BBC, the series was positively received and audiences warmed to the new hosts, Sandi Toksvig and Noel Fielding.Hollywood said a big hope was that the programme inspired people to bake. He said: “We want the general public to actually bake, that’s the point. Some of the challenges are very challenging and some of them we’ve just reined it back a little bit.”The first challenge in the new series will be wagon wheels – or as one contestant calls them, “wheelie-wagons”.Journalists on Tuesday were given an early preview of the first episode. During the showstopper challenge, contestants are asked to construct a spectacular biscuit selfie in a memorable setting. This led to Jon creating a lemon curd sun and buttered cream choppy sea to recreate a family sailing trip Ruby in a triple-layered 40-biscuit design, finishing the London marathon and Dan showing himself and his baby in Palm Springs.The episode kicks off with Toksvig and Fielding poking fun at Leith over how she tweeted last year’s winner several hours too early.Leith, who replaced Mary Berry as a second judge, said she had been more candid with contestants in this new series. “I think because I am more relaxed and a little bit more confident, I think that I’ve been straighter. I’ve found it easier to say, ‘that’s not properly baked’ … The last series I would tell them lots of things that were nice before I would say anything nasty.”One journalist watching the first episode complained there was not enough innuendo. Such quips came spontaneously, Leith said. “They just happen … Don’t worry, you’ll get some.”"},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f1006071ed930918840d56ebb4b9d503477120c/0_200_5176_3105/master/5176.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0c6ab3a9d8ed3434e3ea1486814a372","title":"richard madden webchat post your questions now","story":"The Game of Thrones and Cinderella star is back in Jed Mercurio’s latest thriller, Bodyguard. He joins us on Friday 24 August to answer your questionsRichard Madden’s on-screen life has fluctuated between the ine and the diabolical. The Scottish actor became famous worldwide when he played Robb “King In The North” Stark, the pugnacious eldest son of Ned Stark in HBO’s mega-hit Game of Thrones.Naturally, given the epic scale of the fantasy series, the role became a huge part of his life. “I spent six months a year with these people. I saw my on-screen mother more than I saw my actual mother. So it was personal,” he told the Observer in 2013. “The logical part of me says, it’s just a job.”The jobs kept coming – he landed the role of Prince Charming in Disney’s live-action Cinderella, then played Lady Chatterley’s hunky gamekeeper and also teamed up with Idris Elba for action film Bastille Day. Now he is now starring in Bodyguard, a high-octane thriller from Line of Duty creator Jed Mercurio. Richard plays David, a former soldier who is assigned to protect Keeley Hawes’s hawkish home secretary from a suspected terrorist plot. However, David’s resentments over British military policy means that he might just be her biggest threat.Richard will be joining us for a live webchat at 1pm GMT on Friday 24 August.

I call it our IVF-moon: we know that the regime we’re embarking on will keep us fairly homebound. I’m already on two medications to start preparing my body for potential pregnancy, and soon we’ll add more.We’re visiting an art gallery in a high-ceilinged former factory building and I can’t believe the temperature. I start removing my layers.How on earth can they afford to heat the building like this? I ask E, peeling off my coat and sweater and flannel shirt until I’m down to a clammy T-shirt, and why is everyone else in this gallery still wearing coats indoors?He looks at me like I’m talking nonsense. He’s also wearing his coat.Oh my God, I say, I’m having a hot flash.Thanks to the drugs, I am in (temporary) menopause. The cause of the menopause is Lupron, which is injected into my stomach every night for two weeks with a skinny needle. I’m also wearing estrogen patches, to build up my uterine lining. Once the Lupron stops I move on to the dreaded progesterone in oil: dreaded because it’s viscous and requires a giant needle and nightly shots in the buttocks that cause huge welts and sometimes bleeding. Progesterone in oil is also hard to come by: there’s a nationwide shortage, so even though I have the tremendous privilege of health insurance that covers much of the cost, we’re sent scrambling for more when the mail-order pharmacy can’t fulfill the full order when we need it, which means E has to go pick up extra to fill in the gaps at a cost of $100 per vial. E has to pick the progesterone up because I am somewhat inert. Progesterone side-effects mimic the symptoms of early pregnancy, so I am tired and achy and hungry and lying on the couch whenever possible. I nearly pass out in the midst of a workout, and that’s the end of my attendance at the gym. We’ve now been in the IVF process for nearly six months, and I miss feeling like myself.E comes with me on the day of the transfer, but they don’t let him come in the operating room – he’s not sterile. I change into a hospital gown everyone else in the room is wearing hazmat suits.You don’t want to know the sex, right? says my doctor.No, I say. E and I have discussed this: though the information is there in the file – they identify the sex when sequencing the chromosomes for the other genetic tests – we know that imagining the embryo as a boy or a girl will make us feel a little bit more attached. I’m trying not to feel attached. Someone puts a photo of the embryo on a screen that I can see while I’m lying back on the procedure table: a grey blob of cells. I remember not to get attached.The transfer feels anticlimatic: a quick pinch and it’s done. I’m rolled back into a recovery area and told to lie still for 20 minutes or so, but there’s not much to recover from. They give me a print of the blob photo and I show it to E. We discuss whether it resembles us. I take a picture with my phone and send it to my mother.Isn’t is amazing, she says, that your dad and I are partly in there?It is, I say. It is amazing.And now: we wait. In IVF-parlance it’s known as the two-week wait, though in my case it will be more like 10 days until I return to the clinic for a blood test that will look for HCG – pregnancy hormone – in my blood. If it’s there, I’ll be four weeks pregnant.The only thing you can do during the two-week wait besides, well, waiting, is to take home pregnancy tests. E and I discuss it and I agree not to take one, because of the risk of false results. And then I think about taking one every day. Would it be so bad for me take one? I go into drugstores to look at pregnancy tests on the shelves, to scratch the itch, and then two nights before my blood test I go to a Duane Reade and buy a three-pack and take it home and leave it on the bathroom counter. This makes me feel a little bit more in control.What’s this? says E when he sees it.I didn’t take it, I say, but I wanted to.The blood test is scheduled early on a Saturday morning. I make E come with me, because I’m so anxious, but it’s an anticlimax, too: a quick stick, and then over. We’d planned to go out for breakfast afterwards, but we’re anxious, not hungry. We take the hour-long train back to Brooklyn, take the dog for a walk, go back to sleep for a bit. I stare at my phone. The minutes drag. E makes us some lunch out of random leftovers and we are sitting eating it on the front stoop when my phone lights up with the number of the hospital.Congratulations, says the nurse at the other end of the line. You’re pregnant.My HCG number is not huge, but it’s enough. The nurse tells me to come back in a couple of days for another test to see if it’s rising it needs to double each day.Thank you, I say.E and I put down our food and clutch each other. We blink in the sunlight. We look at the picture of the blob on my phone. There’s so much that could still go wrong, but it could be the first photo of our baby. I allow myself to take the print that the doctor gave me and hang it, with a magnet, on the fridge.This week I learned: HCG is the hormone that home pregnancy tests detect, but a blood test can determine exactly what your level of HCG is, which can be one indicator of the likelihood that a pregnancy is viable."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/80396a32a894cf0bdef8efaaf1ab048dd4b4802a/488_375_2918_1751/master/2918.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc55ccbca13ff7506b80d5e120e7c2f0","title":"chris martin and damon albarn join campaign to free uganda star bobi wine","story":"Musical figures vow to ‘use our voices’ to press for release of the beaten and detained singer-turned-politician Dozens of top musicians including Chris Martin, Chrissie Hynde, Brian Eno and Damon Albarn have signed an open letter calling for the release of detained Ugandan singer-turned-politician Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, known to fans as Bobi Wine.Kyagulanyi was charged in a military court in Uganda last week with unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition after being arrested in the north-western town of Arua following clashes during campaigning for a byelection. The politician’s driver was shot dead in the violence and Kyagulanyi’s arrest sparked two days of anti-government demonstrations. More than 80 artists, activists and politicians signed the statement condemning “the arrest, imprisonment and vicious, life-threatening physical attack by Ugandan government forces”.“We pledge to remain vigilant … and to use our voices … to press for his immediate and unconditional release, and for an end to this and other acts of political repression and violence in Uganda.”Signatories also include Peter Gabriel, Adam Clayton of U2, top African musicians such as Femi Kuti, Nigerian Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka and Tom Watson, the deputy leader of the Labour party in the UK.The Ugandan government described the assault accusation as “rubbish”. President Yoweri Museveni, in power since 1986, has dismissed reports of injuries as “fake news”. Friends and relatives told the  that Kyagulanyi, who campaigns under the slogan “people power”, was left unable to stand after being beaten in detention.Medard Segona, a lawyer and politician representing Kyagulanyi, said: “He is in great pain. He can’t talk, he can’t walk, he sits with a lot of difficulty, his face is swollen and cannot see because of the torture. He couldn’t speak when the charges were read to him and I believe he didn’t know what was going or understood the charges read to him.”The singer was arrested on 13 August along with four other parliamentarians critical of Museveni on suspicion of involvement in the stoning of a presidential convoy during a parliamentary byelection campaign. Kyagulanyi was first charged on 16 August with treason, along with two other lawmakers and dozens of other people. The charges were later downgraded. He remains in a military facility in Kampala and the next hearing is scheduled for Thursday. Rights groups say opposition politicians, journalists and civil society organisations face systematic harassment in Uganda.Police have detained 68 people during two days of disturbances. Among them was a Reuters photographer, who has since been released from police detention. Footage broadcast by local station NTV showed people being struck with clubs and canes by men in uniform. Kyagulanyi’s detention has prompted anger across the region. A march by sympathisers is planned in Nairobi, Kenya, on Wednesday. The US, UK, EU and other powers have expressed their concern. Museveni, a key US security ally, has been elected five times. The last vote in 2016 was marred by allegations of fraud. The 74-year-old leader is now able to seek re-election in 2021 because parliament passed legislation last year removing a clause in the constitution that had prevented anyone over 75 from holding the presidency.Kyagulanyi, who was elected to parliament last year, has emerged as a powerful voice with his calls for young people to “stand up” and take over from a “failed leadership”. On his Twitter feed Kyagulanyi says he is “one Ghetto child who has something to say through music”.He has compared himself to France’s Emmanuel Macron and made no secret of his presidential ambitions. Many songs deal with social and political issues, calling for ordinary young people to act to improve their lives and their country."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/573d410a394ea84f3fe08740f3f91addf8403268/0_0_4560_2736/master/4560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02b19602876d420979274639bbc9e0be","title":"reunions of a lifetime as south koreans head north in pictures","story":"Almost 90 families have met for the first time since becoming separated by the Korean war nearly 70 years ago.

All of which can contribute to a chaotic start in life and lead to serious health problems and lack of socialisation.A ban on third party sales will ensure the nation’s much-loved pets get the right start in life. I pay tribute to the Lucy’s Law campaign, spearheaded by PupAid, Care And Respect Includes All Dogs (CARIAD), and Canine Action UK, who have fought tirelessly for this step.People who have a complete disregard for pet welfare will no longer be able to profit from this miserable trade.The proposed ban on third party sales is part of a series of government reforms on pet welfare including banning the sale of underage puppies and kittens and tackling the breeding of dogs with severe genetic disorders. New laws come into force on 1 October this year banning licensed sellers from dealing in puppies and kittens under the age of eight weeks and tightening the compulsory licensing of anyone in the business of breeding and selling dogs.As part its animal welfare reform programme, the Government is also bringing in higher maximum sentences of up to five years for animal abusers – the toughest sentencing in Europe.Puppies and kittens are defined as being less than six months old.Department for Environment, Food \u0026amp Rural Affairs (DEFRA)The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA)Comment: Don\u0026#39t hold your breath, Left-wingers - Trump will not be impeachedCrazy Rich Asians author Kevin Kwan wanted in Singapore for dodging military serviceTUI Airways sexism row as boys given \u0026#39future captain\u0026#39 stickers while girls get \u0026#39future cabin crew\u0026#39German actress accuses Harvey Weinstein of rape at 2006 Cannes Film FestivalNicola Sturgeon urged to ditch plans for indyref2 as official figures reveal £13 billion deficitFacebook shuts down fake pro-Corbyn and anti-Brexit accounts linked to Iran TUI ad banned for promoting \u0026#39summer holidays\u0026#39 in OctoberRegional cholera outbreak threat in west Africa as cases increase eight-fold in Lake Chad basin\u0026#39Large-scale illegal gun factory\u0026#39 found on Sussex industrial estateJakiw Palij: the quiet New York pensioner who played waltzes as Holocaust victims were gunned down by NazisHow popular is Donald Trump?

The number of pupils with complex needs are rising, yet Ministers have carelessly cut per pupil funding for the first time in a generation, as well as slashing the pupil premium in real terms year after year.A generation of children could end up paying the price for Conservative failure. The next Labour government will invest in our schools, increasing per pupil funding in real terms, to ensure that every child gets the opportunity they need.The findings come after the number of permanent exclusions from schools reached its highest point in nearly a decade – with more than 40 children a day being banned from state schools in England.The Department for Education (DfE) recently launched a review of exclusions to look at why children eligible for FSMs are around four times more likely to be excluded than their wealthier classmates.Russell Hobby, chief executive of charity and teacher recruiter Teach First, said: “Exclusion is the hotly debated topic in education right now and whatever your opinions towards the EBacc, there is no denying that the subject within it are highly valued by top universities.\u0026nbsp“So with higher rates of exclusion and lower GCSE attainment it’s a real cause for concern that poorer young people appear to lack the support and guidance they need to succeed through school, to keep their options open and to meet their aspirations.”He added: “We need all young people to have access to the same high standards of education, regardless of their background or family income.\u0026nbsp“We believe this starts with the many great teachers who are making a significant and life changing difference to young people. With the next generation facing an uncertain future ahead, we need many more talented people to take up the challenge of teaching in disadvantaged communities.”A-level results 2018 – in

pupils being effectively excluded through the back door to boost exam results.It found that 21 per cent of teachers had seen “off-rolling” – where students are taken off the register using informal exclusions – take place in a school they had worked at.Education secretary Damian Hinds recently condemned the practice saying that he heard “many stories” of schools using informal exclusions to get rid of pupils with special educational needs\u0026nbsp(SEN).A study by the Labour Party this week also raised concerns about the treatment of children from poorer homes, reporting that students from deprived families are nine times more likely to attend secondary schools which are rated inadequate compared to their wealthiest peers.“The Teach First conclusions are flawed as EBacc performance and exclusions rates are not directly comparable in this way.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this

They\u0027ve changed policy since but it made coordinating confusing.His original tweet, which was shared more than 2,000 times, prompted others to share their own stories of tech companies acting in poor taste.The social network also faced criticism in 2014 when its Year in Review feature suggested a picture\u0026nbspof someone\u0027s\u0026nbsphouse burning down, while another user said it showed a photograph of his recently-deceased daughter.Facebook apologised at the time, saying: Clearly in this case we brought him grief rather than joy.

The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.The film is full of echoes of other filmmakers whose work Schrader admires. A story of a priest facing a crisis of faith, one of its most obvious influences is Ingmar Bergman’s Winter Light. Its magical realist scene of levitation could come from a Tarkovsky movie. Schrader’s admiration for the French director Robert Bresson is well chronicled. Thankfully, these references don’t weigh down First Reformed, which has an austere intensity all of its own.Ethan Hawke stars as Ernst Toller, a priest whose church, the “First Reformed”, is about to celebrate its 250th anniversary. The congregation is dwindling. The church itself is a draughty old building. There is a leak in the men’s restroom. It is shabby and very old-fashioned when compared to its bigger, newer, shinier and better funded near neighbour, “Abundant Life”.The Reverend Toller is keeping a journal. He writes in longhand and promises to show “no mercy” in what he reveals about himself. Schrader immediately establishes a sharp contrast between the reserved and dutiful Toller we see going about his business in the church and the tormented figure, drinking whisky at his desk as he commits his thoughts to paper in what may turn out to be a suicide note. Toller has plenty to feel guilty about. His son, who enlisted on his advice, died in the Iraq war. His marriage crumbled in the wake of the son’s death. Toller’s health is failing.\u0026nbspAt first, Toller’s faith appears solid enough. When a pregnant young wife, Mary (Amanda Seyfried), asks him to speak to her husband, environmental activist Michael (Philip Ettinger), he is exhilarated to do so. Michael is extremely wary about bringing a child into a world in which climate change threatens disaster. He wants Mary to terminate the pregnancy. Toller makes familiar arguments about following the “righteous” path. Michael seems to listen but his eventual response shocks Toller profoundly. This is a film about a man’s spiritual crisis but it has a strong eco-undertow. One of the most visually striking scenes is when the Reverend preaches a sermon at a toxic waste site with rusting ships and rubbish in the background.\u0026nbspHawke gives a complex and moving performance as the\u0026nbsppriest, dedicated to others but being eaten away by his self-loathing.Schrader may be a veteran filmmaker but he retains some of the same subversiveness and adolescent desire to shock that was there at the start of his career\u0026nbspwhen he was a young screenwriter working on Taxi Driver. The Reverend Toller is like a more mature and religious version of Travis Bickle, the vigilante Robert De Niro played in that movie. Like Travis, Toller wants to clean up the filth. In his case, it’s not pimps and lowlife New York hustlers he is targeting but cynical big businesses like “Balq Industries” which give huge amounts of money to the church even as they leave pollution and devastation in their wake.\u0026nbspFirst Reformed is unsettling and deeply ambiguous. As he watches videos of suicide bombers or wraps himself in barbed wire, Toller appears unhinged – a self-pitying and masochistic psychopath. He can be wantonly cruel. We see him hissing at a choir leader, who cares for him and with whom it is implied that he had a brief affair, that he “despises” her. However, he is also the film’s conscience and its most lucid figure. His relationship with the pregnant woman (Seyfried) is hard to decipher. It goes well beyond that of a priest with a troubled member of his congregation. We are unsure whether it is shared faith, despair or even lust that bring them together.“For you, every hour is the darkest hour,” Toller is warned by a senior church colleague who advises him to “do something in the real world”. By retreating into the spiritual realm and agonising over human weakness, the priest is driving himself towards despair.\u0026nbspSchrader, whose 1972 book Transcendental Style in Film focused\u0026nbspon the work of Ozu, Bresson and Dreyer, has deliberately made an old-fashioned art house film, shot in box-like academy ratio and dealing with self-consciously heavy subject matter. The surprise is that it makes such gripping viewing. The director and his star demonstrate together that you don’t need superheroes, VFX or shootouts for a film to grab an audience’s attention. Against the odds, this story about a middle-aged reverend struggling desperately to make sense of his life is just as dramatic and surprising as even the most intricately plotted thriller.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/22/08/danny-boyle.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/22/08/danny-boyle.jpg","title":"idris elba james bond danny boyle daniel craig replacement who","story":"Created with Sketch.The Luther star has long been considered a frontrunner to become the new 007Click to followThe Independent CultureIdris Elba confirms he won’t be the next James Bond hours after Danny Boyle steps down as directorIdris Elba has denied rumours he will be replacing Daniel Craig as James Bond.The actor has long been considered a frontrunner to replace the 007 star when he steps down from the franchise, however, he has put an end to the rumours.Elba was asked by Good Morning Britain reporter Divya Kohli at the premiere of his directorial debut Yardie whether she was looking at the next 007 to which he simply replied: “No”.The actor, whose credits include hit TV shows The Wire and Luther, recently fuelled speculation following reports that producer Barbara\u0026nbspBroccoli said the door is open for a black Bond in a future film.

She has adopted four Malawian children and was in the country to celebrate the first anniversary of the Mercy James Centre for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, named after one of her adopted daughtersMadonna and Jean Paul Gaultier arrive for the 2018 Met Gala But there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/16/south-africa-school.jpg","title":"south africa corruption president ramaphosa mabuza zuma anc","story":"Created with Sketch.The ruling African National Congress pledges education and opportunity\u0026nbspfor black people\u0026nbsp– but embezzlement in the\u0026nbspdeputy president’s province has left schools so decrepit that children plunge to their death in toiletsClick to followThe IndependentSchool at Orange Farm, near Soweto: one of the ANC’s policies is to improve education for black South African childrenZiyanda\u0026nbspNkosi hated going to the bathroom at school. The pit toilets were so dark, dirty and crumbling. Many children were so afraid of them that they simply relieved themselves in the schoolyard to avoid the ordeal.But as she played with her best friend during recess, the little girl, a six-year-old first-grader, really had to go. She stepped warily inside the closet-like latrine.Even with the gentle pressure of her tiny frame, the floor caved in. Ziyanda flailed wildly, clinging to the edges of the hole, frantically trying to keep herself from falling in and drowning in the fetid pool below.“Mommy! Mommy!” she screamed, managing to hold on long enough for an older boy to run in and save her.Hundreds of parents, enraged that their warnings about the dilapidated school had been ignored for years, burst into protest a couple of days later, upending their quiet rural town for two weeks last August. They burned tires, blocked roads and demanded justice from the provincial government led by David Mabuza, a former maths teacher who had become one of the most powerful figures in the African National Congress (ANC) and was positioning himself to become South Africa’s deputy president.One of the party’s historic promises had been to provide a good education for black people, who had been deliberately denied the opportunity under apartheid. ANC leaders like Nelson Mandela often spoke about freeing black South Africans through school\u0026nbspand Mabuza, whose first big post in the province was education minister, got his political start by promising just that.But under the ANC the education system has been a\u0026nbspshambles, so gutted by corruption that even party officials are dismayed at how little students are learning, in schools so decrepit that children have plunged to their deaths in pit toilets.The rage in Ziyanda’s town grew so intense that protesters hurled stones at a local ANC leader, who narrowly escaped by whipping out his handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd, wounding two children and roiling the community all the more.Mabuza never came to the school or met with the parents –\u0026nbspand for good reason, local officials contend. The dangerous conditions were a clear reflection of his control over the province, where millions of dollars for education have disappeared into a vortex of suspicious spending, shoddy public construction and brazen corruption to fuel his political ambitions, according to government records and officials in his party.But the uprising and allegations against Mabuza did not crimp his political rise. To the contrary, only a few months later, as the ANC tried to quash national outrage over misrule by its leaders, Mabuza scored his biggest triumph by far. He was picked to become second-in-command of the entire ANC, launching him into an even more prominent post\u0026nbspas South Africa’s deputy president, second only to the nation’s leader.Mabuza may seem an odd choice, especially at a time when the ANC is desperate to purge its reputation for graft and restore its image as the rightful heir to Mandela’s legacy. After all, Mabuza’s rural province, Mpumalanga, is fairly small, has little economic clout and is widely regarded as one of the country’s most corrupt.But that is the vexing secret behind Mabuza’s spectacular climb, current and former ANC officials say: he siphoned off money from schools and other public services to buy loyalty and amass enormous power, making him impossible to ignore on the national stage and putting him in position to shape South Africa for years to come.Mabuza (second right) (AFPGetty)“He didn’t become what he is now because of his political capability,” says\u0026nbspFish Mahlalela, a senior ANC figure in the province and a national lawmaker.“No, no, it was out of money and\u0026nbspmanipulation,” he adds. “Nothing else.”Perhaps more than any other member of South Africa’s new government, Mabuza undercuts the promise of a “new dawn” in the country after the removal of President Jacob Zuma this year.Besieged by scandals that have hacked away at the ANC’s legitimacy and electoral prospects, the party installed a new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in February. From the start, he pledged to root out corruption and finally deliver on the promise of a just South Africa for all of its citizens.But to seal his new post, Ramaphosa first had to secure the backing of Mabuza, 57, who built such a formidable political machine that he became kingmaker in the back-room negotiations to choose South Africa’s new president. After campaigning for a rival, Mabuza abruptly switched sides and joined forces with Ramaphosa, helping the two emerge from a pivotal party conference last December as the country’s undisputed leaders.Then, to the surprise of many in his province, Mabuza gave a speech just weeks after being sworn in as deputy president this year, lamenting the poor state of the schools and the “tragedies that take away the innocence of our children”. He spoke movingly of a kindergartner electrocuted at school. Of a toddler who drowned after falling into a broken pit latrine. And of a five-year-old boy whose body was discovered by his mother at the bottom of another dilapidated pit, his hand sticking out of a pool of faeces.Such deplorable conditions were all too common, he noted, symbolising the failure to provide black South Africans with a decent chance at life.“Where is our care?” Mabuza said in the speech. “What has gone wrong with our nation?”Yet under Mabuza’s leadership, millions of dollars for schools in his province have been misspent year after year, according to the national government. His province routinely spent less on poor students than required\u0026nbspand school construction projects have been riddled with inflated costs, government records show.Nearly a quarter of the primary schools in Mabuza’s province still have only dilapidated pit toilets, despite ample government funds to fix them. And during his tenure, his province was caught fabricating the passing rates on the annual national exam, enabling him to claim big leaps forward that never happened.The schools Mabuza did champion provided an easy way to funnel large amounts of money into politics, according to ANC officials, high-ranking defectors and anti-corruption groups. He pushed to build big boarding schools whose costs tripled\u0026nbspfor unexplained reasons\u0026nbspto $30m (£23m) each, alarming education experts. Some construction was so shoddy that roofs sprouted leaks soon after being finished, toilets barely worked, students lacked water, retaining walls collapsed and dormitories were missing doors, according to a provincial report.Over the years, Mabuza’s province also became known as one of South Africa’s most dangerous. Nearly 20 politicians, most from inside the ANC, were assassinated in the past two decades, some after exposing graft in public works projects.All the while\u0026nbspMabuza’s political career flourished. He attracted legions of new ANC members with government contracts, cash handouts and even KFC meals, according to current and former party officials.His sweeping recruitment drive turned his relatively insignificant province into the ANC’s second biggest voting bloc. Under the party’s delegate system, his territory became more influential than even Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria\u0026nbspwith a population three times the size and an economy nearly five times as big.Now, critics contend, Mabuza’s role as the country’s second most powerful politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of the new government and its assertions that the ANC is turning the page on corruption.Under the ANC, Mandela’s once-heralded liberation movement, tens of billions of dollars meant to lift poor black South Africans have been stolen by party leaders. Strong institutions like the tax agency have been hollowed out by party officials bent on shielding their illicit activities.But the nation’s poor schools are perhaps the ANC’s greatest betrayal of the dreams of black South Africans – some of whom have turned to burning down such institutions in protest.Mabuza, who declined to be interviewed, built his political career on the schools. Unlike other, more celebrated anti-apartheid leaders, he did not go into exile he was not imprisoned on the infamous Robben Island. Instead, he fought for the right of black South Africans to receive an equal education, a call he echoed in his recent speech.As many South Africans pin their hopes on Ramaphosa’s pledge for a fresh start, analysts say that much of the country is looking past an unpleasant truth: the new president owes his victory in part to corruption, and much of his administration’s future – as well as the country’s – rests in the hands of Mabuza.“If there is any powerful person whom Ramaphosa’s presidency actually relies on, it is Mabuza,” says\u0026nbspRalph Mathekga, the author of Ramaphosa’s Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?“We are being reluctant as a nation to face the reality of Mabuza,” he adds. “If Ramaphosa gets hit by a bus, Mabuza is going to be the president.”Scandal from the startThe numbers just didn’t add up, even at the beginning.After apartheid ended in 1994, Mabuza got his first big break: he became Mpumalanga’s education minister, a chance to shape the schools and generations of students attending them.He had the perfect resume. The son of farmers, Mabuza grew up here in the province, walking miles from his village to the only primary school in a nearby town. Though he often had no shoes, he always tucked in his shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, recalls\u0026nbspReginah Mhaule, a childhood peer.“He was never late,” says\u0026nbspMhaule, a longtime ally who recently became one of South Africa’s two deputy foreign ministers.A bright student, Mabuza ultimately took one of the few jobs available to black South Africans back then. He taught maths at the local high school and later became a founding leader of a teachers’ association.Poor schooling was a major spark in the anti-apartheid movement, most notably in Soweto in 1976, when thousands of students protested the introduction of Afrikaans as the language of instruction. In Mabuza’s province, teachers and students began organising against white minority rule in the early 1980s.The teachers were at the centre\u0026nbspof the movement, says\u0026nbspSandile Sukati, a teacher who recruited Mabuza into the main student organisation. Mabuza quickly stood out, he says, travelling far and wide to build ties among anti-apartheid groups.Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)“He was a leader in his own right,” Sukati says.But after apartheid ended, Mabuza quickly ran into trouble, leading to the province’s first big scandal of the democratic era.\u0026nbspIn 1997, three years into his tenure as education minister, the schools were performing poorly, especially on the national obsession: the annual matriculation exams that determine whether students graduate from high school. The passing rate in his province was 46 per cent that year, slightly below the national average.Mabuza was feeling the pressure, particularly as powerful ANC leaders returned from exile, often with military credentials that overshadowed his own, several current and former ANC officials say.Sukati, who worked under Mabuza at the education department, recalls Mabuza\u0026nbsptelling some of the teachers: “I am in a tight situation.”\u0026nbspThe next year brought a stunning improvement. The passing rate inexplicably jumped to 72 per cent – an incredible turnaround that catapulted Mpumalanga to second place\u0026nbspamong the nation’s nine provinces.“I was suspicious,” says\u0026nbspSukati, who is now a senior education official. “It couldn’t just happen like that.”A whistleblower exposed the cheating a few weeks later. The real passing rate, authorities announced, was under 53 per cent. Moreover, the doctoring had taken place inside Mabuza’s residence, where he met with a small circle of bureaucrats, some of whom were later fired.An investigation was never completed. Mabuza never admitted wrongdoing or suffered any significant consequences. Dropped as education minister, he was named head of housing instead.Ever since, Mabuza’s career has been remembered for that scandal, one that helped establish the kind of culture of impunity in his province that has tarnished the ANC across South Africa..“I think\u0026nbspthe man, he had to be charged, but unfortunately I don’t know what went wrong,” says\u0026nbspRonnie Malomane, an ANC official who was taught maths by Mabuza in the early 1980s. “They were just giving him position after position.”Nationally, Mabuza’s standing kept rising, propelled by his success at attracting new party members. In 2009, Zuma appointed him premier of all of Mpumalanga province.But Mabuza raised more red flags, stripping some of the decision-making power over government projects from local officials and concentrating it in his own office. He justified the move – called the “Rapid Implementation Unit” – as a way to act quickly. Others had a different explanation.“That’s how he managed to loot,” says\u0026nbspCollen Sedibe, a former ANC leader who grew up on the same street as Mabuza and worked under him in the provincial housing department.Treasury officials in the province say they are now investigating the irregular expenditures “incurred through the contracts arranged centrally by the Office of the Premier”.But parents, officials and educators had warned about the damage from corruption and neglect for years, pointing to the painfully overcrowded classrooms and decaying, apartheid-era schools.‘They wanted to kill me’It took four days of rage before the local ANC councillor showed up.The councillor, Justice Twelve Siboza, explained that he had been busy the week Ziyanda fell into the toilet, tending to another corner of his ward. Other activities had also drawn his attention: he is a gospel singer with his own radio show, so he crisscrosses the region to perform at weddings and funerals.By the time he got to Ziyanda’s school, hundreds of parents had closed off the unpaved roads, furious that their grievances had been met with near silence from the ANC’s leaders.Siboza made sure to bring a gun. Politics is dangerous in South Africa, sometimes lethal, he says.The ANC has a grip on the area around the school because most residents, aside from the lucky few working at the sugar cane plant, are poor and rely on the party for government jobs, contracts or monthly welfare grants.It is an area Mabuza knows well. He began his ascent inside the ANC as the head of this part of the province. It was once part of a homeland set aside for black people by the apartheid government. To this day, several ANC officials say, Mabuza has kept a hold on it through powerful proxies.Some see a deep cynicism behind the conditions in the schools. When black South Africans become educated and move into the middle class, their loyalty to the party tends to wane, recent elections have shown. So by perpetuating a culture of dependence, critics contend, the ANC ensures its dominance.But Mhaule, the childhood peer of Mabuza, rejects\u0026nbspany suggestion that the ANC had failed to prioritise education.Officials like Mhaule say the rising pass rate on the national high school exam provides clear evidence of progress. But the figures can be misleading. The number of students taking the exam has declined in the past two years. Weaker students who would drag down the rate are being held back, education experts say.About 600 protesters gathered at the school that cold Friday morning when Siboza, the local ANC councillor, arrived with a police escort. As he moved to talk to the parents, demonstrators showered him with rocks.“They wanted to kill me,” the councillor says.Siboza made a run for it, reaching for the hip holster under his brown overcoat. He took out his gun – firing three times and hitting two teenagers, a girl and a boy.Agreement Mashele, the school board chairman, was shocked. “This man is a church member,” he says.A few days later, the ANC councillor visited the children he had wounded.“The councillor said he was very sorry,” says\u0026nbspthe girl, Siphesihle Ngobeni, whose left leg was grazed by a bullet. The councillor pleaded with her not to press charges and gave her about $15, she says. She used the money to buy sanitary pads.The boy’s injury was more severe. His father, Petros Thobela, who had gone to the same primary school and did not have a job, accepted a similar apology and compensation of, according to the councillor, about $150.The boy’s mother, Nobuhle Ndlovu, who does odd jobs, deplores\u0026nbspthe state of education.“They promise,” she says, “and they just disappear.”Still, she would remain loyal to the governing party.“Yes, of course, I vote ANC,” she says. “It’s our freedom.”‘He always had money in his house’The protests spilled into September, but the country’s attention was fixed on another battle: the national push to replace Zuma as South Africa’s president.The all-important ANC party election was only a few months away, and officials in Mabuza’s province were bracing to see whether his years of hard work had paid off.In early October, the ANC released the delegate breakdown, with good news for Mabuza: his previously low-ranking province was now the ANC’s second most powerful.Mabuza owed his outsize influence to a single feat. In the past decade, ANC membership in his province had skyrocketed nearly 190 per cent, eclipsing the national increase of less than 60 per cent. No other province came close to matching Mpumalanga’s explosive growth.But Mabuza’s numbers were as cooked as his high school passing rates, current and former ANC officials contend.In South Africa, taxes are collected by the national government, which distributes the money to provinces. The provinces then use the money – with little oversight from above.Treasury officials in Mpumalanga say that “irregular expenditures” more than doubled in the previous two budget years, particularly in education, housing and health.Wages account for most of the education and health budgets. So money is usually siphoned off by politicians and business allies through contracts for services or construction, ANC officials say. When costs are suspiciously high, schools are poorly built or facilities are badly maintained, they say, it is often a warning that money is being skimmed, at the students’ expense.Thousands in Israel protest draft law that would ‘exclude’ ArabsGrenfell victims were subject to ‘social apartheid’, says Diane AbbottSouth Africa is the most unequal country in the world, says World BankMandela’s letters chart his heartbreaking struggle from behind barsAs premier, Mabuza promoted the construction of big boarding schools, or mega-schools, in farm areas to improve rural education. Since 2012, the province has completed five, with two more in the pipeline.For reasons that have not been explained, the price of each school has ballooned from $11m to around $30m.Asked whether Mabuza wanted the mega-schools to facilitate the theft of public funds, Mhaule, his former education minister, laughs\u0026nbspand says:\u0026nbsp“I don’t know.”But other officials say the mega-schools were overpriced projects to reward Mabuza’s allies and finance his ANC membership drive.Mabuza\u0026nbspwas sworn in as deputy president in February. “His passion,” reads his official biography, “still remains in education.”Minutes after the swearing-in, he faced questions about corruption and political killings in his province. “There’s nothing to set straight,” he told the national public broadcaster.“I’m here to serve South Africans,” he added. “Let’s give this government a chance.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/22/10/sea-slug.jpg","title":"survival laziest evolution slow molluscs natural selection sea slugs snails","story":"Created with Sketch.Research looking at ocean creatures like sea slugs and shellfish shows those with minimal energy requirements are more likely to prosperClick to followThe IndependentScientists looked at nearly 300 species of sea slugs and other bottom-dwelling creatures to assess the impact of pace of life on survival over millennia Laziness is an effective evolutionary strategy that ensures the survival of the species, according to a theory laid out in a new paper.This “survival of the slacker” idea has emerged from a study of creatures living on the Atlantic sea floor and how they have fared over the past five million years.The work suggested that a slow pace of life can be a good strategy that helps iniduals, species and even whole groups of species last longer.Although the research was based on lowly molluscs such as sea slugs, sea snails and shellfish, the authors suggested this could be a general principle that applies to higher animals as well.The scientists carried out an extensive study of the energy needs of 299 species of extinct and living bivalves and gastropods over millions of years.Those that had managed to escape extinction and survived to the present day tended to be “low maintenance” species with minimal energy requirements.Molluscs that had gone the way of the dinosaurs and disappeared had higher metabolic rates than their still flourishing cousins.Science news in picturesScientists have witnessed the birth of a planet for the first time ever. 224 New human organ discovered that was previously missed by scientistsLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. 324 Previously unknown society lived in Amazon rainforest before Europeans arrived, say archaeologistsWorking in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. 424 One in 10 people have traces of cocaine or heroin on fingerprints, study findsMore than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.524 Nasa releases stunning images of Jupiter\u0027s great red spotThe storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean.

But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system.

This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.US ecologist Professor Bruce Lieberman, who co-led the University of Kansas team, said: “Maybe in the long term the best evolutionary strategy for animals is to be lassitudinous and sluggish.“The lower the metabolic rate, the more likely the species you belong to will survive. Instead of ‘survival of the fittest’, maybe a better metaphor for the history of life is ‘survival of the laziest’ or at least ‘survival of the sluggish’.”The findings, reported in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, could have important implications for forecasting the fate of species affected by climate change, said the scientists.Dr Luke Strotz, also from the University of Kansas, said: “In a sense, we’re looking at a potential predictor of extinction probability.“At the species level, metabolic rate isn’t the be-all, end-all of extinction – there are a lot of factors at play. But these results say that the metabolic rate of an organism is a component of extinction likelihood.“With a higher metabolic rate, a species is more likely to go extinct. So, it’s another tool in the toolbox. This will increase our understanding of the mechanisms that drive extinction and help us to better determine the likelihood of a species going extinct.”Energy consumption had a bigger impact on species that were narrowly distributed, the researchers found.Species with a narrowly confined range were far more likely to go extinct if they had a high metabolic rate.Molluscs were used for the study because of the huge amount of available data on living and extinct bivalve and gastropod species.The team now plans follow-up work to see if “survival of the laziest” natural selection applies to other kinds of animals.Dr Strotz added: “There is a question as to whether this is just a mollusc phenomenon.“There’s some justification, given the size of this data set, and the long amount of time it covers, that it’s generalisable. But you need to look – can it apply to vertebrates? Can it apply on land?”The oldest animal ever known was a 507-year-old clam from the Icelandic seabed called Ming.\u0026nbspThe incredibly low metabolic rates of Ming and its fellow ocean quahog clams is thought to be responsible for their long lifes.Unfortunately, Ming’s long life was brought to an abrupt end in 2006 when scientists assessing its age killed it by opening its shell.Additional reporting by PAEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/28/23/Windrush-0.jpg  width= 2470  height= 1853  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/28/23/Windrush-0.jpg","title":"windrush government deportations british citizens uk caribbean home office rudd javid","story":"Created with Sketch.Home secretary told failure to say sorry to all those affected \u0027brings into question whether the home office has a realistic grasp on all the people it has wrongly detained and removed\u0027Click to followThe IndependentWindrush: Government admits 83 British citizens may have been wrongfully deported due to scandal but will only apologise to 18More than 160\u0026nbspWindrush citizens could have been wrongfully deported from the UK or detained,\u0026nbspHome Office\u0026nbspfigures\u0026nbsphave revealed.Home Secretary Sajid Javid released the figure\u0026nbspin a letter to the chair of the home\u0026nbspaffairs select committee, Yvette Cooper,\u0026nbspin which he also vowed to apologise to the families of 18 people “most likely to have suffered detriment because their right to be in the UK was not recognised”.Amnesty International criticised the decision to only apologise to 18 of the iniduals involved, saying it was “worrying” and cast doubt on the government’s willingness\u0026nbspto learn\u0026nbspfrom the scandal.Labour said the apology was “nowhere near good enough” and\u0026nbspcondemned the government for not having a clearer idea about the number of Windrush citizens affected.A Home Office unit looked at 11,800 cases of Caribbean Commonwealth nationals who were removed or\u0026nbspdetained by the department since\u0026nbsp2002.Records of 83 deportees contained evidence they were in the UK before 1 January 1973, the date the 1971 Immigration Act granting\u0026nbspthem British citizenship\u0026nbspcame into force.In its initial response to the Windrush\u0026nbspscandal in April, the government said there was “no evidence” any iniduals had been deported, although it revised the figure up to 63\u0026nbspcases in May.It has since changed the way it calculates the totals, meaning people deported after being convicted of a crime are no longer counted – despite technically being British citizens due to their\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspstatus.A new category was also created\u0026nbspfor citizens\u0026nbspwho were removed because they “appear to have then left the UK to reside overseas for more than two years, thereby losing their entitlement to indefinite leave to remain”.That category accounts for\u0026nbsp74 of the 83 people removed. Neither those 74, or the unknown number\u0026nbspwho were removed after being convicted of a crime, are among those who will receive an apology.Of the 83\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspcitizens the Home Office now says it removed from the UK, 31 were detained beforehand, either at an immigration removal centre or a port.A further 81 people\u0026nbspthought to be Windrush citizens\u0026nbspwere detained but not deported.Details of all 164 Windrush\u0026nbspcitizens have now been passed to\u0026nbspa special taskforce who have started contacting\u0026nbspthem, the home secretary said.Mr Javid said in the letter: “It is clear from our internal analysis of these that features of inidual cases are markedly different.“The way in which each inidual was treated by the department, and the degree of detriment suffered, varied considerably.”In 18 of the cases\u0026nbsprecords suggested\u0026nbspthey were detained or deported specifically because they could not demonstrate\u0026nbspcontinuous residence in the UK.In a statement, Mr\u0026nbspJavid\u0026nbspsaid: “The experiences faced by some members of the\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspgeneration are completely unacceptable and I am committed to righting the wrongs of the past.Home Office tells destitute Windrush woman to seek charity helpThe Windrush gagging order scandal will continue to haunt the Tories“I would like to personally apologise to those identified in our review and am committed to providing them with the support and compensation they deserve.“We must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like this happens again – which is why I have asked an independent adviser to look at what lessons we can learn from\u0026nbspWindrush.”Another report\u0026nbspby the influential group in July criticised the Home Office for failing to provide full figures about the number of Windrush\u0026nbspcitizens affected by the scandal.It said the Home Office must undergo total reform, warning that unless the department was overhauled the scandal “will happen again\u0026nbspfor another group of people”.The Home\u0026nbspOffice taskforce\u0026nbspreceived 6,507 enquiries from possible Windrush cases between April –\u0026nbspwhen it opened a call centre – and July, the letter to the Home Affairs Committee chair revealed.Yet only 3,585 people had been given documentation confirming their status by last month –\u0026nbsp2,272 under initial arrangements and 1,465 under the government’s formal Windrush scheme. The majority of the applicants were Jamaican nationals\u0026nbspbut the total also included people from Barbados, India, Grenada and Trinidad and TobagoThe government has been accused of “dragging its feet”\u0026nbspover a compensation scheme for the\u0026nbspWindrush generation. A\u0026nbspconsultation on the issue is scheduled to run until October, meaning victims will have to wait until\u0026nbspautumn for a decision on the programme.In response to Mr Javid’s\u0026nbspletter, Labour’s shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the apology to 18 of the victims was “overdue and is nowhere near good enough”.“The government has still not got a final figure on how many of our fellow citizens were deported, forced into so-called ‘voluntary removals’ or detained as prisoners in their own country,” she continued.“It is an insult that the home secretary has still failed to confirm when the promised compensation scheme will be up and running, after so many of our fellow citizens have been left destitute, in debt and jobless by the government’s hostile environment.\u0026nbsp“Labour is calling for a hardship fund to be set up immediately to support these people ahead of the promised compensation scheme, which will clearly not be up and running for months.”Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

Refusal to recognise the rights of people entitled to live in this country continues even now.“Among those being denied their rights are the thousands of children, many born in the UK, who are blocked from claiming their British citizenship rights because of a profit-making fee they cannot afford.“The government should urgently change tack, properly scrutinise\u0026nbspthe myriad ways in which its policies and practices continue to wrongly treat people as if ineligible or unentitled to be here, and do all it can to ensure that people both know and can claim their rights.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/12/10/puerto-rico-philadelphia-washington-post.jpg  width= 2221  height= 1666  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/12/10/puerto-rico-philadelphia-washington-post.jpg","title":"hurricane lane latest tropical storm hawaii maui category 4 weather track","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027Major Hurricane Lane could bring significant impacts to the Hawaiian Islands late week and into the weekend,\u0027 officials sayClick to followThe Independent USHurricane Lane: Weather service issues hurricane watches for Hawaii and Maui as tropical storm upgrades to category 4The National Weather Service has issued hurricane watches for Hawaii and Maui counties with\u0026nbspHurricane Lane barreling\u0026nbsptowards the islands having\u0026nbspbeen upgraded to a Category 4 storm.\u0026nbspLane has\u0026nbspsustained winds of 150 miles per hour as of Tuesday morning local time, the National Weather Service of Honolulu said\u0026nbspOfficials said it was\u0026nbsptoo early to report which of the main Hawaiian islands would be directly impacted – though they noted if the hurricane’s centre remained offshore its impacts could still extend well away from the centre.

The laws\u0026nbspwould have helped the country meet its obligations under the Paris climate agreement.But after rebel Liberal Party MPs led by former prime minister Tony Abbott threatened to vote against the legislation – which would have triggered a crisis of confidence in Mr Turnbull – the PM decided to back down.As Greece burns, the Tories are signing off a laughable fracking billGlobal temperatures to be ‘abnormally high’ for at least four years2018 will be fourth-hottest year on record, climate scientists predictDealing with climate change by geoengineering Earth ‘would not work’It was Mr Abbott himself who signed Australia up to the Paris climate agreement, and it was he who at the time announced the\u0026nbspemissions reductions target of\u0026nbsp26\u0026nbspper cent from 2005 levels.In 2014 he even said Australia could reduce emissions by up to 28 per cent, saying:\u0026nbsp“There’s a definite commitment to 26 per cent\u0026nbspbut we believe under the policies that we’ve got, with the circumstances that we think will apply, that we can go up to 28 per cent.”Despite the boast, he was later reported to have told colleagues he was “misled” while in Paris, and recently argued that using energy policy as a means of reducing emissions is “madness”.\u0026nbsp“In politics you have to focus on what you can deliver,” Mr Turnbull said on Monday, adding the legislation would not pass parliament if it contained an emissions target.“Cheaper power has always been our number one priority when it comes to energy policy,” he told reporters.Mr Abbott has reportedly thrown his support behind Peter\u0026nbspDutton, Australia’s home affairs minister, for a possible leadership challenge, though Mr Turnbull said he had the support of his party colleagues including Mr Dutton.Efforts to introduce climate change combatting emissions targets have repeatedly frustrated Australian politicians.In 2007 Kevin Rudd famously declared climate change “the great moral issue of our generation”, but was unable to push through the changes he wanted while PM, eventually dropping them. His Labour party successor, Julia Gillard, faced an aggressive campaign led by Mr Abbott against her plans to reduce pollution, in which she was called a liar and was personally derided by conservative campaigners.MPs his government has dropped plans to put an emissions reduction target into legislation (EPA)The current debate over the impact of energy policy on climate change has seen even greater polarisation.Mr Turnbull’s failure to win support for the emissions target, comes despite a recent history of worsening wildfires and searing temperatures. The bushfire season has typically begun during the country’s summer months, but Australia’s increasingly hotter, drier weather has seen the season brought two months earlier – well into winter.Meanwhile, in January this year, Penrith, 30 miles west of Sydney, was the hottest place on earth, hitting 47.3C, while Sydney was 44C.10 photographs to show to anyone who doesn\u0027t believe in climate changeA group of emperor penguins face a crack in the sea ice, near McMurdo Station, AntarcticaAmid a flood in Islampur, Jamalpur, Bangladesh, a woman on a raft searches for somewhere dry to take shelter.

Even those of us who will never hit the big time have an Instagram audience waiting to “like” our every selfie.So this is just the logical next step towards making cosmetic surgery available to the masses, rather than the few.Some have argued that Superdrug Botox is actually a good thing, because it bridges the gap between the elite Harley Street options — where you pay several hundred pounds for an appointment with an “aesthetic doctor” — and the more backstreet treatments carried out by hairdressers with just a few hours of training.I disagree. Being able to buy a syringe or two of Botox when you are out shopping for your hairspray legitimises — and normalises — the act of injecting poison in your skin in the name of beauty.Being able to buy Botox over the counter, so to speak, makes it seem like no big deal — just another tick in the “maintenance” box, and as reasonable as tinting your lashes or getting your ears pierced.And that is the problem. All decisions we make about our appearance boil down to personal choice. And if it makes someone feel better to tinker cosmetically or surgically with their natural looks, that’s their choice. No one should judge them for it.But there is a wider problem.Increasingly, women think that whatever they look like naturally isn’t good enough. More and more, the “solution” is invasive cosmetic enhancement.A mainstream shop making Botox available for less than 100 quid is surely only going to add to the pressure some women feel to change their appearance using more than just make-up.Superdrug presents itself as responsible because it will refuse to treat under-25s, when other clinics will.That is shocking — not so much that some clinics WILL treat under-25s but that anyone so young could think they need Botox.You can’t blame Superdrug for this epidemic. It is simple supply and demand.The question is: Why the growing desire among women to look frozen?It’s not like you can get away with saying you’ve not had it when you have, because it’s so obvious.I’ve got a friend whose husband jokes that she needs to hold up little signs saying “happy” or “angry” when she feels an emotion, since her face is so paralysed by botulism.While I’m a big believer in your body, your choice, I’m also a believer in scratching the right itch.The truth is if you feel good about yourself, you look good. If you feel bad and lack confidence, nothing, no amount of Botox or fillers, will ever change that.Just look at Meg from Love Island, above, who, even after an estimated £40,000 worth of plastic surgery, is still massively insecure.Because it’s not what’s on the outside that counts, it’s what’s on the inside.The problem is our society tends to give far too much weight to the outside. That is especially the case for women, but increasingly for men, too.I realise all of this is easy to say, harder to act on. I’m as susceptible as the next person to comparing myself with ­others more beautiful — and possibly more airbrushed — and finding myself lacking.I’m just glad that, when that happens, I know the thing that will make me feel better is far more likely to be self-acceptance than Botox.After all, if you tighten a prune you don’t get a grape — you just get a tight prune!So the really big question is, how to achieve self-acceptance when we are surrounded by all these images of perfection?Well, we are all on our own journey with that one but I’ve got some suggestions which might help.The first is to focus on what you have, rather than what you don’t. And the second is to never, ever compare yourself to anyone else.Forget Botox, you can have that advice for free.You’re welcome.We all enjoyed cheering on the Three Lions players that would quickly become our heroes during the World Cup in Russia this summer.Sadly, those heady days are over and we were reminded of the seamier side of sport this week with the arrest of England rugby union ace Danny Cipriani.His embarrassing brawl outside a Jersey nightclub came hot on the heels of England cricket’s Ben Stokes’ trial over his clash with two men during a night out.Stokes was cleared, but what links these sorry sagas is our drinking culture, which dictates that consuming excessive amounts of alcohol is a normal way of letting off steam.Sportsmen are supposed to be role models, as they influence young people and need to keep themselves in good physical shape.But as long as we think it is OK to binge and push our bodies to the limits rather than sip a few drinks, then violence, injuries and stupid mistakes will continue to be a regular feature of our nights out.And if you are an England sports star, then public shame is just one of the tragic consequences – along with the end of your career – that you might have to face.Why should anyone be surprised at the news that sexual harassment in the police force is rife?Let’s face it, it happens everywhere. So why should the police be any exception?I thought they might hold themselves to higher standards. But no.A new survey reveals that dirty jokes, inappropriate touching, leering and being pressured to have sex are daily issues for many police staff.In a survey of almost 1,800 police staff in England, Wales and Scotland, half had heard sexualised jokes and one in five had received a sexually explicit email or text from a colleague.Shockingly, one in five had also been touched in a way that made them feel uncomfortable.Our head of police at West Ham is a woman.She is smart, tough, brave and would never put up with this type of behaviour.Part of the problem is that many women accept these actions as “normal” and don’t even know how to object. We must learn to stop putting up with it.But it is much more important that men learn what is OK and what is not.End of.Jacinda Ardern – the Prime Minister of New Zealand, who has continued to work since becoming a mother in June – was criticised this week for “using her baby as a prop” after she was seen breastfeeding her daughter at a public meeting.I guess whoever coined that phrase has never had the experience of looking after a baby who needs to be fed – right NOW.Nor will they have dealt with the very loud consequences of that failing to happen.Instead, what about congratulating Jacinda on doing such a great job of being a working mum?We said farewell to two legends last week, let’s remember them with this wonderful meme....So interesting that the day after A-level results arrived, more than 26,000 university places were still available.An Ipsos Mori poll found that while most students still think university is “important”, that is down from 86 per cent five years ago to 75 per cent now.Since a degree is expensive – and no guarantee of a job – you can see why people are questioning the validity of one.However, there is no viable alternative.There are just 10,000 degree-level apprenticeships available, compared with 300,000 university places, according to Sir Peter Lampl, of the Sutton Trust.We need to think how we prepare young people for work and we need more technical qualifications at degree level that offer the chance of a bright future.GOT a story?

Our poll shows those that have are mostly Remainers who would now vote Leave. Project Fear has never worked, and it is not going to suddenly start working now. The public are wise to it.Our poll makes it clear that fudging Brexit would unleash serious anger among the electorate. The Government should take notice.Almost half of voters already reckon that the political classes in Britain are making heavy weather of Brexit, in the vain and misguided belief that they can get the public to change their mind.Meanwhile, the drop in support for Theresa May in the polls and Ukip’s rise is a further indication of what the public thought of her Chequers proposals.Millions more will abandon the Tories if Brexit ends up being fudged.Remoaners and Brussels have done their best since the Leave vote to make us think we made a terrible mistake and that the cards are stacked in the EU’s favour.Well, today’s poll is clear. We didn’t and they’re not.DEFENCE Secretary Gavin Williamson was right to stand up to France after they tried to bill us £2million for helping them stamp out a jihadi insurrection in Mali.Mr Williamson reportedly threatened to ground our choppers in retaliation.

No more!”IT is scandalous that cops in the capital are reliant on weapon-detecting equipment donated by the public.Knife crime is the most deadly threat our youngsters face on the streets today.This week two men were killed and four teenagers stabbed in separate incidents.How can we expect cops to stamp out this deadly crimewave if they are reliant on public donations?The Government needs to properly start tackling this crisis. Lives depend on it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is whether the PM herself will seize the initiative and signal her own plan to jump before she is pushed.The undeclared contest has transformed Britain’s negotiating stance — from Theresa May’s meek, slow-motion surrender to a strident demand for a decent, honourable settlement. The good news is that while MPs have been away on holiday, Brussels has begun to blink.At long last it has dawned on our EU neighbours that they have more to lose from a messy Brexit than we do.Forfeiting the UK’s £40billion ransom payment — plus our annual £12billion contribution — would instantly cripple the EU expansionary budget plans and plunge poorer nations such as Greece into crisis.Car and pharmaceutical giants, not to mention French farmers, who export vast stocks to the UK, would be plunged into crisis. Cooperation on crime, security and defence would be at risk. Governments across Europe are now piling pressure on Brussels to see sense.Tory leadership wannabes have sniffed the way the wind is blowing.The Tories won’t pick another Remainer as party leader. Nor does this Government have a prayer at the next election unless it can see off Nigel Farage and his Ukip insurgents with a deal that satisfies the 52 per cent who voted Leave.This explains a sudden enthusiasm at the top for stating the blindingly obvious: Britain will survive a clean Brexit, while an obstructive Brussels will be diminished.After two years of being bossed around by EU bully Michel Barnier, senior Cabinet ministers are coming out as born-again Eurosceptics. Foreign Secretary and repentant Remainer Jeremy Hunt admits Britain will experience some turbulence, but says the EU will be damaged “for a generation”.His warning is echoed by Brexit supremo Dominic Raab, who has rubbished “Project Fear” stories about food and medicine shortages.While loyally insisting a deal is “still the most likely outcome”, Mr Raab insists Britain will cope with the alternative.Hunt and Raab are now openly jockeying for the top job — along with Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, Treasury chief Liz Truss and a host of others.Significantly, Michael Gove seems out of the race after endorsing Mrs May’s Chequers sellout. So where does this leave Boris Johnson? If tens of thousands of grass- roots Tory supporters have anything to do with it, he would be way out in front. As things stand, they don’t.BoJo is out of office and fighting confected outrage over Muslim face masks. Enemies such as the priestly Dominic Grieve threaten to quit the party if he is elected.Under present rules, Boris needs enough support from fellow MPs to be one of the two candidates submitted to party members for a final verdict. His rivals will do anything to stop him — which is why party activists are demanding rule changes to allow any MP with 20 votes to enter the final ballot.Boris has gone quiet — but not for long. He is reportedly planning a nationwide tour — complete with bright-red battle bus — trashing Mrs May’s Chequers deal and calling for a clean Brexit.There will be plenty of opportunities for car-crash interviews and zipwire-style TV images. But the bookies aren’t the only ones making BoJo the clear favourite as Britain’s next Prime Minister.He names Somalis, Ethiopians, North and Central Africans and Afghans as being responsible for the knife-gang slaughter of young black and Asian men.“Race is part of the picture,” says the equality campaigner. “Failing to point this out impedes the fight against these crimes and imperils yet more children of colour.”He is right, isn’t he?But how long before this decent black man is himself accused of racism for daring to tell this unvarnished truth?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will our current free movement regime be rebadged as a “Labour Mobility Framework”?Such a move, speculated on in the media this week, would be politically toxic and very poorly timed. It would also betray her own instincts, which she rightly gave voice to when she became Prime Minister.Striking a chord with millions of people angry and alienated at their voices being ignored by the political elite on immigration and the downside of globalisation, delivered for her record poll ratings then and a real feeling of hope that at last people in power were listening.Yes, the main driver for the Leave vote was about democracy, independence and national sovereignty but it was also about the fundamental choice that a UK outside the EU would have: Who comes to our country and on what basis – decided by our own Parliament.Voters have noticed that the tightening of the labour market and record employment levels, as revealed by the Office for National Statistics last week, mean that at long last real wages – i.e. pay packets less inflation – are slowly rising and that belatedly big business is beginning to move away from an over reliance on cheap foreign labour, undercutting the pay and conditions of indigenous workers and giving rise to higher welfare dependency.It might seem a radical concept, but such employers might just have to pay workers decent wages, train them better, improve their skills and try hard to retain them. That’s why EU workers are still coming to the UK in huge numbers, despite ridiculous Project Fear stories to the contrary.So yes – Brexit will mean higher pay for British workers! Top businessman Stuart Rose, briefly spokesman for the Remain campaign, accurately predicted such a development before the EU Referendum.Regrettably, the multinationals’ trades union, the CBI didn’t get the message: No surprise that they now want no restrictions on foreign workers post Brexit – in other words an endless pool of cheap labour just like now.Likewise, they’re happy to defend the growing gap between average pay and that of FTSE 100 bosses.Ironically, The Prime Minister could still snatch victory from defeat on this issue, notwithstanding her lamentable record as Home Secretary on reducing net immigration to the tens of thousands.The alternative White Paper which David Davis and his Ministers were working on prior to it being dumped at Chequers, was much more evidence-based and looked to many workable international examples of mobility agreements between first world countries like Australia, the United States, Japan and Canada, as a model for future EU-UK immigration arrangements, to our mutual benefit.The policy would have been informed by the Migration Advisory Committee which reports next month, focused on what was the sensible policy for the whole of the UK and all business sectors rather than a noisy minority and their well-paid advocates.It also sought to end the systemic bias towards low paid and low skilled EU citizens over the well qualified from across the globe.It was pro controlled immigration and not about pulling up the drawbridge and that’s where most British voters are now.Will Theresa May use the opportunity to keep faith with the millions of people in the north and the midlands, in south Wales and south west, who look to her to keep her promises and defend their interests and not just those of the well heeled, the multinationals and those comfortable with the Brussels status quo?Will putative leadership contender Sajid Javid have the courage to resist further attempts at craven supplication on continuing free movement in all but name? Will Conservative MPs who benefited from the highest ever blue collar vote for their party in history, ignore their own electors’ concerns and just accept further concessions?The electoral prospects of her party depend on it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And our departure from the corrupt, bullying, protectionist EU club they bizarrely consider a beacon of liberal values.Their latest co-ordinated ruse — backed by rich celebrities, has-been politicians and former newspapers — is to pretend a second referendum would “bring a divided Britain together”.They are actually arguing that after two years of abusing 17.4million Leavers as thick racists, Remainers now deserve a second chance to get what they wanted. And that, whatever the result, we would all magically unite behind it.If there’s a more laughably mad contention, we haven’t heard it.We might once have wondered what they were smoking.

Appropriation.In the eyes of today’s politically correct policers of “wrongthink”, there is no greater crime than cultural appropriation.Cultural appropriation is when people embrace the grub or music or ideas of a culture that isn’t theirs.Like when Kylie Jenner wore her hair in cornrows. Or when Katy Perry donned a Japanese kimono. Or when drunken lads on a university campus put on sombreros as they neck shots of tequila.All of these things have been branded cultural appropriation by today’s potty warriors against “offensiveness”.And to this blacklist of things we must never appropriate, we can now add non-native foods.This is not the first time Jamie Oliver has been criticised for making foreign dishes. Two years ago foodies were up in arms when he put chorizo in paella — which the Spanish tend not to do.Clearly Jamie Oliver is only allowed to cook “white” British food, like roast beef and toad-in-the-hole.Not Cornish pasties or Yorkshire puddings, though.After all, what right does a man born in Essex have to appropriate the food of Northerners and people from the West Country? And presumably Dawn Butler only ever tucks into Jamaican dishes.If it is cultural appropriation for Oliver to make jerk grub, surely it must be cultural appropriation for Ms Butler to rattle up a bit of sushi?This would be the crazy conclusion to the war on cultural appropriation — none of us would ever dip into other cultures and experience their pleasures.What is most depressing about the Butler/Oliver spat is that it confirms how mainstream the miserabilist, divisive PC worldview has gone.It used to be just time-rich posh kids and snowflakes on university campuses who raged against cultural appropriation.Like the officious students at Cambridge who banned an Around The World in 80 Days fancy-dress party for fear students would wear “culturally appropriated” costumes.Or the clipboard bores at the University of East Anglia who banned students from wearing sombreros.Or the easily offended muppets at the University of Ottawa in Canada who banned a yoga class, because for white people to indulge in this ancient Indian discipline is an act of “cultural genocide”.I bet you never knew that when you do a pelvic tilt at your local gym you are being a horrible racist.Now, however, with Butler’s missive against the crimes of Jamie Oliver, this PC claptrap has crept from the fringes into the political centre. Butler is Shadow Secretary for Women and Equalities, and she is very close to Jeremy Corbyn.Is this what we should expect under a Corbyn government? Finger-wagging at anyone who deviates from PC rules?The worst thing about the clampdown on cultural appropriation is how divisive it is. The message is that we must always stick with our own cultures and never borrow from others.Didn’t that used to be known as racism?In recent years, Beyonce has been slammed for wearing a sari. Glastonbury has banned attendees from wearing Native American head-dresses. Selena Gomez was ridiculed for doing a Bollywood- inspired dance on US TV.This new racial divisiveness makes ­culture stiff and dull.Anthony Horowitz, author of the Alex Rider teen spy novels, says he was “warned off” from writing a black character. Apparently a white writer like him ­cannot understand the black experience.Is this really the world we want to live in?

In terms of spending, Scotland has more than paid its way.Spending overall in Scotland was £73.4billion - with the biggest chunk on welfare, at a record £236 billion, while tax revenue was £60billion.But rivals pointed out the so-called “union dividend” - the gap from higher spending plus lower tax revenues - was at £1,882, double the level at the 2014 vote on Scottish Independence.SNP leader Ms Sturgeon attempted to explain the figures, saying: “Firstly, there are very good reasons why public spending per head in Scotland is higher than it is for the UK.“Not least the rurality of our population. That would be our first point. The second point is, GERS - as it is every year - is looking at a situation over a single year.“If we look at the situation in Scotland within the UK over a longer period of time, this notion that Scotland is somehow subsidised simply doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.”Scottish Tory shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser said the figures showed how Scotland could not afford to become independent.He said: “By being part of the UK, Scotland received an extra £1,576 for every man, woman and child last year above the UK average.For a family of four, that’s more than £6,000 in additional public spending.“If Scotland was to be ripped out the UK, this spending would be slashed drastically, meaning schools, hospitals and infrastructure would be hit.”And the Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the deficit figures were concerning.He added: “However these figures also confirm that being part of a strong United Kingdom – the 5th largest economy in the world – is worth nearly £1,900 for every single person in Scotland, which supports vital public services.“Simply put, Scotland contributed eight per cent of UK tax, and received more than nine per cent of UK spending for the benefit of families across the country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

that you can only buy a puppy from a legitimate breeder, someone that you can visit, that you can see that puppy alongside their mum so that you know that animal has been brought up in a caring environment.\"The new legislation comes off the back of a nine-year campaign, called Lucy\u0027s Law, led by vet Marc Abraham of the Pup Aid campaign.He was motivated by the story of Lucy, a King Charles Spaniel who was rescued from a UK puppy farm in 2013.She\u0027d been used as a breeding bitch for five years, forced to have litter after litter, while living in appalling conditions.\"Before Lucy was rescued, she would have most likely been confined to a cage or a pen,\" Mr Abraham told Sky News.\"Every single litter, her puppies would have been removed too early because there\u0027s an

smuggling is a lucrative business.Demand for puppies in the UK far outstrips supply from ethical breeders, meaning unethical breeders can charge high prices for puppies and kittens.But there are concerns that a ban on third-party sales would penalise pet shops which are already facing new, stricter sanctions on what puppies and kittens they can sell.\"New animal activities licensing regulations, which cover dog breeding and pet vending, will raise the bar on businesses that are involved in these activities,\" the Pet Industry Federation, which represents more than 2,000 pet

animal mistreatment.Paula Boyden, veterinary director at Dogs Trust, told Sky News: \"Currently if you are found guilty of smuggling puppies illegally into the UK you can get a sentence of up to three months.\"But if you are found guilty of illegally importing cigarettes, you can receive up to seven years.\"Tougher sentencing is being introduced this October as part of a raft of new animal welfare

Campaigning medic Dr Phil Hammond condemned the Corporation\u0027s fear after being dropped from his three-hour Saturday morning slot on BBC Radio Bristol. It came hours after the GP, who investigates and writes about NHS failures, tweeted he will stand against Mr Rees-Mogg for the National Health Action Party in the next general election. In a statement today, Dr Hammond claimed he had told the head of BBC Radio Bristol of his intentions weeks ago and was advised it should not be a problem until the election itself. Saying he was sad and a little puzzled, he added: I strongly suspect whoever made this decision has never listened to any of my broadcasts. Such a sudden decision smells strongly of fear.  There is no political bias on the Saturday Surgery, just three hours of health and happiness with some live music. I shall really miss the fantastic team at BBC Radio Bristol and all the loyal listeners. It\u0027s been a hugely enjoyable 12 years. The National Health Action Party campaigns against creeping privatisation in the NHS. It has never won a seat in Parliament, but its candidate Louise Irvine came second in then-Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt\u0027s seat last year with 20% of the vote. Now the party is hoping to challenge Mr Rees-Mogg\u0027s 10,235 majority in North East Somerset.

Even so, there are still some unusual rules that can land you in hot water if you’re not aware of them. Here are six laws that could affect each and every driver in the UK - but which you might not have known about... Offence 1: Splashing pedestrians    It’s infuriating when it happens: getting drenched from head to toe in muddy water after a careless road user drives through a puddle. Worse still is the fact that it’s not always accidental. We’ve all wished we could see justice for this type of driver, but in actual fact they are breaking the law and the penalty is pretty severe. Under section three of the Road Traffic Act 1988, it is an offence to drive “without reasonable consideration for other persons”, and this includes any instance of “driving through a puddle causing pedestrians to be splashed”.   The maximum punishment is a level five fine of \u0026pound5,000 in instances where driving “amounts to a clear act of incompetence, selfishness, impatience or aggressiveness”. You are more likely to be be issued with a \u0026pound100 fixed penalty notice and three penalty points if you are caught. But if you refuse to pay and take the matter to court you could see a maximum fine of \u0026pound5,000 imposed. Offence 2: Buying from a drive-through using your smartphone We all know that using our phones while driving is strictly forbidden, and quite rightly so. But what is sometimes forgotten is that this rule also applies on private roads and land where the public has access. Feel like paying for your tasty takeaway or refreshing iced coffee using contactless on your smartphone? Think again. While it would take a particularly strict law enforcement officer to penalise you for this crime, it is technically possible for an officer to issue a fixed penalty of \u0026pound200 and give you six penalty points.  Halfords tip: If you have to use your phone to pay it might be better to park up and walk into the restaurant. However, if you need a sat nav, remember that touching your phone when driving is still illegal. A better option is to invest in a Garmin Drive 50 Sat Nav, \u0026pound89.99 (save \u0026pound10) which you can use within the law. As well as preloaded lifetime maps of the UK and Ireland, it\u0027s packed with added features that will help you reach your destination safely. The driver awareness features include alerts for dangerous curves, fatigue warnings, speed changes, wrong way on a one- way, railroad crossings, animal crossings, and more. Offence 3: Leaving your engine running    One of the more surprising rules of the road is that you must have your engine switched off when stationary. This law was not, originally, to prevent pollution - it was designed to reduce noise. The fine is \u0026pound20, although in London it could be higher (up to \u0026pound80) because of strict emissions rules. The law itself dates from the 1986 Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Act, but it doesn\u0027t mean you have to turn off your engine when in a traffic jam or stopped at lights. That said, if you’re stuck for a while, switching off is a great idea. Halfords tip: Switching off your engine will save fuel and money, so make sure you do it whenever you can. You do, however, need to make sure that your car battery is in good working order. Visit a Halfords Autocentre for a Free Battery Check to make sure you can start your car easily, every time. Many modern cars have start/stop technology which automatically stops and restarts your engine when stopped at lights or queuing in traffic. This requires special heavy duty batteries - a Halfords expert can help you pick exactly the right battery for your car. Offence 4: Sleeping in your car    We all know that drinking and driving a car isn\u0027t acceptable, but if you find yourself stuck after a night of heavy drinking then you might be tempted to sleep in your car. This may seem like a sensible idea if there’s no other way to get home, but it’s actually illegal and you can be prosecuted for being drunk in charge of a motor vehicle. It doesn’t matter if the keys are out of the ignition and you’re sat in the backseat, you could face a fine and a maximum of ten penalty points.  Halfords tip: Instead of sleeping in your car, grab the Two Person Dome Tent, above, for \u0026pound12 (save \u0026pound18), and Envelope Sleeping Bag, \u0026pound8 (save \u0026pound12). A little camping trip is way more fun than trying to sleep in a cramped car. You might also want to keep a top-up battery in your car for emergencies and impromptu camping trips. The Juice Power Station, \u0026pound25, (save \u0026pound5) has enough capacity to recharge a phone multiple times and will stay charged for up to six months. Offence 5: Using a phone in the passenger seat    Using your phone while driving is illegal and if you\u0027re caught you can get six points and a \u0026pound200 fine. But what a lot of people don\u0027t realise is that this same law applies to anyone teaching a learner driver too. Learners need to be supervised at all times and so the law takes a dim view of their instructors - professional or not - being distracted by mobile phones. So no witty social media updates and absolutely no Spotify playlist curation while you\u0027re teaching someone to drive. The answer, therefore, is the same as it would be for anyone driving a car. Either keep your phone in your pocket, bag or invest in a mobile phone holder. Mounting the phone to the windscreen keeps you legal although the drivers view must not be obstructed. Halfords colleagues can fit a car mount for you making sure it’s in the right place. Once that’s done, you’re good to use your phone to give your learner driver directions from your sat nav.  Halfords tip: The Belkin Dash or Window Mount, above, is a good solution to this problem. It\u0027s just \u0026pound20, which is a lot less than the \u0026pound200 fine, and its got extendable arms to fit any phone up to 6-inches in size. Offence 6: Driving with a broken brake light If your vehicle has something wrong with it, e.g. a broken brake light or no screenwash, the police may give you a ‘vehicle defect rectification notice’. You’ll need to get your vehicle fixed and provide proof that it’s been fixed (for example, a receipt for the work from a technician). You have 14 days from the date of the notice to show the proof to the police.

Award-winning businesswoman Natasha Ahmed, who runs Fabulosity Boutique in Glasgow, Scotland, took large deposits for wedding and bridesmaid outfits.  But while one devastated customer claims her bridesmaids\u0027 dresses failed to arrive for her big day, another says the bridal gown she ordered didn\u0027t turn up. Instead, the woman claims she received an old, worn item that belonged to someone else and was a size 14 rather than an eight, the Daily Record reports.  And a third customer says she paid a \u0026pound325 deposit for three outfits for her brother\u0027s wedding, but as the ceremony grew closer, they didn\u0027t arrive.   She claims she was given excuse after excuse before Ms Ahmed placed an emergency order in Glasgow - which she reluctantly agreed to. But when the outfits arrived, they were allegedly in a terrible state. She says they were the wrong colour and size, while the finish was awful.  Last year, the Record reported on how Ms Ahmed had let down customers. At the time, she blamed staff for the failures - saying she had been busy planning her own wedding - and promised to refund affected customers. But more than a year on, the businesswoman has continued to pocket cash for orders she has allegedly never fulfilled.  One woman handed over a deposit of \u0026pound1,000 for a bridal gown. However, the dress reportedly failed to arrive until the day before the wedding – and when it did, it was in the wrong size and colour. Jumma Begum said: “It was not the dress I ordered.   It was an old worn item that clearly belonged to somebody else. It was not the colour we agreed on, I’m a size eight and the dress I received was a 14.” Ms Ahmed is facing fresh legal action from alleged victims, who claim her \u0027broken\u0027 promises ruined their big day and left them out of pocket. Arissa Hoque, 23, was devastated when four of her bridesmaids’ dresses failed to arrive for her ceremony on Sunday.  She reportedly paid a deposit of \u0026pound500 for the gowns in June and was assured by Ahmed they would be delivered by July 13.   She and her sister Happe, 39, say they spent weeks trying to contact Ms Ahmed, who allegedly ignored their correspondence.  They were forced to fork out another \u0026pound500 for last-minute replacements.  Arissa said: “What should have been the happiest time of my life was ruined by the stress of this. Despite demanding the money back, I’ve yet to see a penny.”  Happe claimed that after she transferred \u0026pound500 into Ms Ahmed’s account, she stopped responding to her messages. She alleged: “After weeks of chasing her, it became clear that we were never going to get the dresses and it was all a con. “She’s a liar who should be ashamed of herself.” Ms Ahmed’s business claims to operate from premises at Central Chambers in Hope Street. But when the Record visited, they were told her shop had been closed for months. Her phone number has been disconnected but she has reportedly continued to take orders online from customers all over the UK. Ms Ahmed - who claimed she had been let down by suppliers in India - won the Young Achiever of the Year category at the 2013 Scottish Asian Business Awards. Her outfits have been worn by a number of high-profile women, including MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh. But in October 2016, customer Fayeema Rahman won a court case against Ms Ahmed over a \u0026pound500 deposit for a wedding dress that never arrived.   Another angry customer Sarra, 20, from Glasgow , paid a deposit of \u0026pound325 in February last year for three outfits for her brother’s wedding that August.  When the dresses failed to arrive, Ms Ahmed allegedly claimed there had been a problem with the suppliers. Sarra said: “As the wedding grew closer, we tried several times to get in touch with her and it was just excuse after excuse. She said they were held up in customs, which I later found out is a lie she’s used before.” Ms Ahmed reportedly next said the dresses would arrive on August 14, but then contacted Sarra to say she feared they weren’t going to come at all. Sarra added: “She promised she could get us dresses by placing an emergency order in Glasgow. I was really worried I wouldn’t have anything to wear so reluctantly agreed. She alleged that the outfits arrived in a terrible condition. Not only were they the wrong colour, the sizes were incorrect and the workmanship and finish was awful, she claimed. We had to wear them because we had nothing else.” A source close to Ms Ahmed’s family said they have given her thousands of pounds to bail out her business debts.

The two men were seen transporting caged dogs around Scotland in a video obtained by the Daily Record. They were filmed giving water to ten puppies in a layby close to a busy road in Dumfries and Galloway on Sunday. The footage came to light as the Government announced it will ban the sale of puppies by pet shops, online dealers and other third party sellers. It follows a campaign by animal rights activists and the Daily Mirror after Cavalier King Charles spaniel Lucy was left with fused hips and a curved spine from being caged.  Animal welfare charity the Scottish SPCA are investigating the latest clip. The men, who had seven border collie puppies and three golden labrador puppies in the back of a van, were thought to be transporting the pooches as part of a puppy farming network. The person who filmed the clip, and wishes to remain anonymous, can be heard approaching the men and shouting you\u0027re absolutely out of f*****g order you two c***s. The men refuse to respond and remain silent, instead walking away before the clip cuts out.  Social media users were appalled by the footage and pictures, which has now been shared over 54,000 times since it was uploaded on Sunday. The run-in was reported to police, who confirmed they were aware of the post. The SSPCA confirmed they are looking into the clip as part of ongoing investigation into puppy farming in Scotland. Sales of pups from illegal factories are estimated to have netted \u0026pound13 million in Scotland last year alone.  A social media user, who did not film the footage but also did not want to be identified, posted the photos and video of the men to social media. They wrote: These people were filmed today Sunday August 19 at 3/4pm by someone in Dumfries and Galloway in South West Scotland. This vehicle is part of a known puppy farming network, and today they headed south with these poor puppies. They are known to travel this area and beyond to both Scotland and England trying to sell these pups. The only positive is that these nine look reasonably healthy. The poster continued: Please don\u0027t buy from puppy farmers as this criminal trade is what\u0027s behind it. They\u0027re making money from these poor souls. Not buying from them is the only way to stop this trade long-term.  And if you\u0027ve bought one of these puppies from them please get them checked out for their own sake health wise. The footage begins with the two men giving water to some black and white border collie pups in a side road. The puppies whine and thirstily drink the water as the person behind the camera films them. One of the men then takes a cloth and gives the tiny puppies a wipe down, while six other puppies in cages can be seen in the back of the open van. Traffic can be heard speeding past as the men tend to the puppies, who can be heard whining loudly.  Three brown and white border collies and three golden labrador puppies can be seen whining in the background as the man cleans the two young collie pups. The person filming moves in to the van and gets a quick shot before walking off. He can be overheard saying you\u0027re absolutely out of f****** order you two cs as the footage ends. On social media, Margaret Paterson wrote: Let\u0027s get these scumbags. Poor wee pups. Jane Marsh added: Total scum. I hope they can be stopped.

They appear to have been friends for a little while. During the course of that time the defendant appears to be fairly flush, he began to give Ms Chubb money not simply for her services, but he decided to pay her rent and put money towards bills. It appears from text messages the he appears to have some feelings for her. No doubt she was happy that he was looking to take care of her and that he was essentially making things easier for her. Then he started to get a bit weird with her. It appears he had given her about \u0026pound10,000 over a period of about 18 months. There are loads of text messages relating to the money and her saying she will pay him back and him saying No, you don\u0027t owe me anything. The money was given over as a young but wealthy benefactor.

Sean Simmons, 28, tied the woman to a bath, covered her face with a towel and poured cold water over her from a Radox container. The former topless barman, from Hull, then told her: This is what I do to people who lie. I\u0027m going to make you tell the truth. The woman was left terrified and now fears her burly ex - who has subjected six women to domestic abuse or violence - will go on to kill someone, Hull Live reports.  Neil Jones, prosecuting, said the woman was struggling to breath and thought in the heat of the moment she was going to die when she was waterboarded. Later the same day, on July 30, 2016, Simmons produced a white-handled knife and was telling her he would have to kill her, Hull Crown Court heard. Mr Jones said: She really thought that the defendant would kill her. She seriously entertained that prospect on production of the knife. Although the victim briefly resumed her intimacy with Simmons after both incidents, she has since moved away to escape him, and said in a statement she would not feel safe if Sean is ever released from custody.  She said: I\u0027m aware how close to death I came in the short time I spent with Sean, and I do not believe I would survive if I came into contact with him again. I have to leave Hull. I believe he will kill some other female if he is not in custody. Judge Mark Bury adjourned sentencing for an assessment of the risk Simmons poses after hearing a total of six women have now suffered domestic abuse or violence at his hands. The couple met on Facebook that summer and almost immediately began a sexual relationship, the court heard. The woman was very fond of him but gradually began to realise all was not well and he was extremely jealous. A month before the waterboarding, Simmons spat at the woman in bed while a couple of inches from her face, causing her to cry. This had followed a 20-minute telephone conversation she had with her ex-partner, which became an obsession of Simmons leading to the water torture.

But with the changes to the system causing debate - and confusion - we\u0027ve broken down when you can get your results and what the changes are. GCSE grade boundaries have come under scrutiny as the move from A-G to 9-1 cames into effect for even more subjects. While the boundaries were released the day before previously, now they will only be updated on the day. A level exam boards won\u0027t be publishing them in advance over fears they will cause students stress. What time are GCSE grade boundaries released? The grade boundaries are now released on results day - August 23. Each exam board will release their grade boundaries individually on their websites after they work them out and check them between 6am to 8am. Here\u0027s where to check for each exam board. AQA exam board grade boundaries will be released after 8am on August 23. The Assessment and Qualifications Alliance (AQA) grade boundary calculator - called the UMS converter - lets you see where your raw marks sit on the uniform mark scale. OCR exam board grade boundaries will be released after 8am on August 23. CCEA exam board grade boundaries will be released after 8am on August 23. Pearson Edexcel board grade boundaries will be released after 8am on August 23. WBJC board grade boundaries will be released after 8am on August 23.  What are the new grade boundaries? The GCSE reforms mean students are no longer A*-G. Instead, they follow a numerical grading system from 9 (the highest) to 1. The change is intended to give more differentiation at the top end of the scale. Grade 9 is above A*. Grade 4 is similar to Grade C - the basic pass grade. Schools will be measured on the proportion of pupils achieving strong pass - grade 5. If you have Grade 3 or below in English and Maths you will be expected to resit. Grade 7 is roughly the same as A grade.  Have they been lowered or raised? This year the GCSE grade boundaries will be lower than previous years. This year is the first time students will receive most subject results with the numerical system after a big shake up last year it was just the main subjects. As well as changing the grading system the content of the exams has also been made tougher. Students sat between 20 to 25 papers on average. To make sure pupils are not unfairly compared to previous years the pass mark for some of the exams could be lower than normal. This means the same amount of students will pass as in the past Ofqual confirmed that no student is disadvantaged. But experts have argued the changes will mislead the country and undermine the reforms. "},{"url":null,"title":"how can you buy puppy","story":"NewsHow can you buy a puppy dog?

The announcement comes on the back of the Mirror\u0027s long-running Lucy\u0027s law campaign which has been calling for an immediate halt to the sale of young pets by third-party commercial dealers. A petition supporting the change in the law was signed by nearly 150,000 people. Lucy\u0027s Law aims to hold breeders accountable for the animals they earn money from and reduce serious health problems and socialisation issues which afflict pets who have been poorly bred. Many people are asking what the changes will mean if they want to buy a puppy or kitten in the future - and what breeders they should look out for. How to buy a puppy or kitten? Providing the animal is over six months, puppies can still be bought from third-party dealers, like pet shops. But anyone wanting a pet younger than six months will have to deal directly with the person breeding that animal.  The Kennel Club, the UK\u0027s governing body for canine activities, advises buyers should be aware of key rules and regulations when dealing with a breder. They advise a buyer should always be given the opportunity to see a puppy with its mother and litter - and be given the opportunity to handle all puppies. A buyer should also check the litter has been registered with The Kennel Club and should be made aware of background and socialisation of a particular puppy, including how to best introduce the puppy to a home. Trying to buy from a breeder that lives in a household as similar to yours as possible is also advisable. When it comes to asking a breeder questions, The Kennel Club stresses the importance of asking for a Contract of Sale, a document which details both the breeders\u0027 and owners\u0027 responsibility for the puppy. A buyer should also ask for written advice on training, feeding and exercise, as well as documentation of a dog\u0027s ancestry and any health certificates. Buyers should ask what vaccinations a puppy has had and which ones are required. Breeders can also offer four weeks free Kennel Club insurance with a new puppy, starting from the moment the dog is collected.    What should breeders be aware of? Lucy\u0027s law brings about changes to the threshold for which a dog breeding licence is now required. Since 1999 the threshold by which a dog breeding licence is required was anyone in the business of breeding dogs for sale regardless of numbers of litters produced in a 12 month period. A licence was also needed for anyone breeding five or more litters in a 12 month period, assuming they’ve sold at least one puppy, regardless of whether they are in the business of breeding and selling dogs.   From 1 October anyone breeding dogs and advertising a business of selling dogs, regardless of numbers of litters produced in a 12 month period, will need a licence. In addition anyone breeding three or more litters in a 12 month period, assuming they’ve sold at least one puppy, regardless of whether they are in the business of breeding and selling dogs Changes in the law now mean breeders will be held more accountable for the welfare of the litters they breed.

The Government announced that it will ban the sale of puppies by pet shops, online dealers and other third party sellers. Environment Secretary Michael Gove heaped praise on the campaign which highlighted how these sellers rely on puppies supplied by callous commercial breeders who raise animals in horrendous conditions. We will eliminate puppy farming,” he declared in a speech at Number 10, Downing Street. “We will make sure third party sales of kittens and puppies ends. Far too many of the pets that people, with the best will in the world, bring into their homes we know have been brought up in squalid circumstances, in circumstances of pain and suffering and misery which should never be inflicted on any living thing.”  He singled out for praise Brighton vet Marc Abraham, the founder of Lucy\u0027s Law, Pup Aid, Care And Respect Includes All Dogs (CARIAD), and Canine Action UK and told the Mirror: “Congratulations on your campaign”. He added: “It’s been phenomenal having the support of Andrew Penman and the Daily Mirror keeping this issue in the news”. An ecstatic Marc Abraham, a previous winner at the Animal Hero Awards, said: “I\u0027m delighted with the news that Lucy\u0027s Law is finally going to happen. “For years irresponsible breeders in the UK and abroad - puppy farmers - have always used third parties to keep themselves well-hidden from the buying public. “By banning third party sellers, Lucy\u0027s Law will ensure all breeders are accountable, making it the first major step in tackling puppy farm cruelty. “Lucy\u0027s Law is a tribute to Lucy and all the victims of the third party puppy trade and I thank all my fellow campaigners, supporters, parliamentarians, celebrities and ethical animal welfare organisations for their help in protecting the future health and happiness of this country\u0027s dogs and cats.  A statement from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs detailed how the ban would mean that anyone wanting to buy or adopt a puppy or kitten must either deal directly with the breeder, or with an animal rehoming centre. Celebrities at the event included Brian May, who said: “This is wonderful, all credit to Michael Gove for listening to the public and to Marc Abraham who has campaigned for this fearlessly”. Actor Peter Egan said: “I’m euphoric, Lucy’s Law is the way to stop this dreadful puppy trade.” Thrilled Eamonn Holmes praised the MPs who united behind the campaign, saying: “I’m delighted it’s got cross party support, this is what politics should be about, fighting for the greater good.” Beverley Cuddy, editor of Dogs Today magazine, has highlighted the horrors of third party puppy sales for years.  She lavished praise on Marc Abraham and the tens of thousands of members of the public who signed the Lucy\u0027s Law petition. “This is a victory for common sense and democracy - the biggest leap for animal welfare in our lifetime,” she said. “It’s always been illogical that we licenced something so abhorrent. “It was Marc who first saw this elegant and achievable goal of banning third party sales. “Despite surprising hurdles, he never doubted, never gave up and it has been a huge honour to help amplify his message. “Things are at last going to get better for our best friends.”  Linda Goodman of campaign group Care And Respect Includes All Dogs declared: “This is an enormous breakthrough for animal welfare. “If people are insistent on buying a puppy – despite our rescue centres overflowing with beautiful, healthy, loving dogs they could adopt - then they will now have to physically go directly to a breeder and see what the health and disposition of the mother is like.” Eileen Jones of the charity Friends of Animals Wales has taken in hundreds of dogs abandoned by puppy farmers. “What has kept me going through the very darkest of days and nights has been the belief that one day there would be a campaign to end this abuse of man\u0027s best friend,” she said. “Lucy\u0027s Law is the best hope we have ever had of changing the whole system of acquiring a new family member and with the support of the Government and of the public we will at long last be able to ensure that dogs receive the very best standards of care.”  A central supporter in Parliament was Scottish Nationalist MP Lisa Cameron, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Dog Advisory Welfare Group, who was almost in tears at the news. It\u0027s been a groundbreaking campaign, she said. Since the launch in December we\u0027ve had overwhelming support from the public, celebrities, MPs from all parties and - credit where it\u0027s due - from journalists, its been fantastic, we\u0027ve achieved this together. David Bowles, assistant director of public affairs at the RSPCA, said: “The RSPCA knows first-hand the misery the puppy trade causes to dogs and families. “The only people who profit from this unscrupulous trade are the sellers. “We believe it’s vital to crackdown on this underground trade to provide much-needed protection to dogs and people, and welcome an end to the third-party sales of puppies. “Coupled with the new licensing regime and proper enforcement, we believe the new system will help ensure better health and welfare for dogs and will better protect people from being duped by unscrupulous sellers.” An early backer of Lucy’s Law was the International Fund for Animal Welfare.  Its UK director Philip Mansbridge said: “This is a fantastic result for thousands and thousands of puppies. “It’s been such a big problem for such a long time, we must thank Michael Gove and all the organisers who have worked tirelessly to make this happen. “Thank you Daily Mirror for keeping it in the public eye.” The Kennel Club was absolutely delighted with the annoucement.  “The Kennel Club has long called for an end to the sale of puppies in pet shops and by other third party retailers, as puppy farmers often use such outlets to sell their pups to unsuspecting members of the public who never see the terrible conditions that the pups were raised in, said Secretary Caroline Kisko.   “When this policy is implemented it will stop the suffering of many dogs and send a very strong message to puppy buyers that it is never ok to see a puppy in any environment other than the one it was born and raised in, and with its mum. Responsible breeders, such as a Kennel Club Assured Breeder, will have nothing to hide and would simply never sell their puppies to a pet dealer or pet shop, and would always speak at length with a prospective owner before selling them one of their puppies. As part its animal welfare reform programme, the Government is also bringing in higher maximum sentences of up to five years for animal abusers, the toughest sentencing in Europe. 2012Brighton vet Marc Abraham of the Pup Aid campaign launches “Where\u0027s Mum?” to highlight importance of always seeing a puppy with its mother before buying2013Lisa Garner gives a home to an abandoned puppy farmed dog and names it Lucy.

Cheryl Halliburton, 27, has suffered from severe eczema flare-ups on her face and neck every few days, after falling pregnant with her daughter Alexis, now three. The skin condition left Cheryl with red, sore skin, that cracked open, causing sore, open wounds, and made her so ill and self-conscious she would be left unable to leave the house. At her wit\u0027s end Cheryl decided to try CBD oil, a naturally occurring cannabinoid found in cannabis, and found it had a remarkable effect on her skin after inhaling the natural remedy through a vape pen. Cheryl, a careworker from Elgin, Scotland, said: It really began when I fell pregnant with Alexis when I was around 23 years old.  It started on my back and cleared up after a course of steroids but straight away it flared up on my face and neck and has been constant ever since. It would flare up every couple of days depending on what I was eating and it would be an uncontrollable itch and no cream I put on it would soothe it, in fact, it would often make it worse. I would feel like I wanted to rip my skin off.  I felt like I couldn\u0027t go on anymore as I was just not getting any answers from the doctors. On bad days I wasn\u0027t even able to take my daughter to nursery or would be unable to work or leave the house and a combination of antihistamine and painkillers would make me drowsy. Cheryl had eczema as a child, but quickly grew out of it and believes that the hormone imbalance in her body from her pregnancy kicked started the sore and itchy skin condition. Struggling to find the ongoing cause of her eczema, Cheryl attending endless amounts of GP appointments where she was continuously given courses of steroids tablets, light treatment and blood tests. Cheryl was left unable to wear make-up or go on nights out with friends because she feared eating the wrong thing or drinking alcohol could cause her skin to react. It wasn\u0027t until August 2 this year, that Cheryl\u0027s flare-ups got out of control and she was rushed to Dr Gray\u0027s Hospital in Elgin by concerned husband, Craig, 32, who told his wife he could no longer see her suffer. Mum, Cheryl, said: I couldn\u0027t move my face and neck and there were open wounds on my chest that were weeping.

Brave little Elsie May was seen perched on the beautiful carriage, wearing Hull City FC\u0027s colours, as she made her way to her brother Stanley Metcalf\u0027s funeral.  The youngster absolutely loved her twin and would do everything with him.  And this morning, she made sure she was by football-mad Stanley\u0027s side as his coffin was carried to Chanterlands Avenue Crematorium in Hull.  She waved to their family when she spotted them in the crowd. Stanley was found fatally injured at a property in Sproatley, East Yorkshire, on July 26 after he was shot in the abdomen in a pellet gun accident.  He tragically died in hospital later the same day.  Many of his close friends and family donned the amber-and-black shirts of his favourite football team as they bid him a final, emotional farewell. A pair of white horses, draped in flags of the same colours, pulled the white carriage carrying Stanley\u0027s coffin and Elsie May to his funeral service.  On the side of the hearse, stunning yellow flowers spelled out \u0027STANLEY\u0027.  The coffin passed four Star Wars stormtroopers, Iron Man and Captain America as it was carried into the crematorium\u0027s grounds by the horses.  There, Stanley\u0027s grieving loved ones had gathered to say goodbye.   The film characters led the cortege through the grounds to the service, before standing guard as the youngster\u0027s coffin was carried into the chapel. Many mourners shed tears and were inconsolable.  The service was to be followed by a \u0027fun day\u0027 event in the city.  In a statement issued through Humberside Police ahead of the funeral, Stanley\u0027s family said: We are absolutely devastated and completely heartbroken without Stanley and it still doesn\u0027t feel real we won\u0027t see his happy, smiling face again.  There are no real words to express how the loss of Stanley has affected us and we all miss him so much. He was so vibrant and full of energy, a typical six-year-old boy who just wanted to have fun and enjoy life, and he adored playing football.  They added: The condolences and support we have received have been incredibly touching and we would like to thank everyone, friends, the general public and the media, for their kind words and sensitivity during what is such an emotional and devastating time for us. Stanley\u0027s funeral will be a day dedicated to him and for him, he is all that matters. The statement concluded: Stanley was a loving, caring and beautiful boy, and there is a huge gap in all our lives now that will just never be filled. Last month, Stanley\u0027s great-grandmother had revealed the heartbreak the family faced in telling Elsie May that her twin had died.  She said the pair were extremely close. “His sister absolutely loved him to bits and they would do everything together, said the 84-year-old, who asked to remain anonymous. I don\u0027t know how you\u0027re supposed to explain things like that to a six-year-old girl.  She added: “I\u0027ve just been in floods of tears ever since it happened, I couldn\u0027t even sleep last night, just thinking about him and how tragic it all is.” Stanley, described by loved ones as a beautiful boy inside and out, had been visiting family in Sproatley when he suffered the pellet gun injury.  He was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary, but died hours later.  The \u0027fun day\u0027 event was due to be held at Hull\u0027s St Mary\u0027s Queen of Martyrs Academy this afternoon instead of a wake, the Hull Daily Mail reported.  Organiser Kayleigh Pepper earlier said: Stanley\u0027s family have made the decision not to have a wake as we know it but to celebrate his life in doing something that represents everything he stood for. The fun day will begin at 12.30pm, straight after Stanley\u0027s service and Jenny and Andy (Stanley\u0027s mum and dad) have one request and that is for it to be as fun as it possibly can.

Usually found in far-flung tropical countries, there have been no previous cases of the rare STI Donovanosis recorded in the UK. That is until now. The nasty bug causes genital ulcers to grow and spread. If left untreated flesh in the groin literally starts to eat itself. And according to a Freedom of Information request, submitted by online pharmacy chemist-4-u, the rare sexually transmitted disease Donovanosis has been diagnosed three times. Twice in Bolton and once in a woman, between the age of 15 and 25, in Southport in the past 12 months.  Although Donovanosis itself can be treated with antibiotics, time is of the essence. Infections typically occur in the genital area, but they can also appear around the nose, mouth and chest. In all, there are four types of Donovanosis to be aware of. The first is fleshy red ulcers that bleed when touched, known as ulcerogranulomatous. Secondly, a dry ulcer with a raised, uneven edge, this is known as the hypertrophic or verrucous type. A necrotic infection is deep and foul smelling and causes severe damage to the tissues. A sclerotic or cicatricial infection is a dry lesion with scar tissue. Sex with an infected person is not the only means of catching the disease, which is twice as likely to affect men than women.  Simple contact with a victim\u0027s bleeding ulcer is enough for it to be passed on and symptoms can show one to 12 weeks after coming into contact with the bacteria. And without treatment, the ulcers increase in size and other bacteria can also attack the ulcers which then generate a foul smell. Half of infected men and women have sores in the anal area, which appear as small, red, beefy lumps. The bumps gradually erode but as the disease spreads it starts to destroy tissues in the infected area. There are also possible complications involved in contracting the disease, which can include permanent genital damage and scarring, loss of skin colour and irreversible genital swelling due to the scarring. The disease is usually found in tropical and subtropical countries such as southeast India, Guyana and New Guinea, and due to its rarity in Britain it doesn\u0027t appear on most STI lists, compiled by UK sexual health websites. But it\u0027s now far from being contained to far-flung places and instead is making a comeback in Australia and South Africa too. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) said it has not found any previous cases in the UK.

The weather is going to take a turn for the worse heading into the Bank Holiday weekend, and it may leave some longing for the heat that persisted for weeks earlier this summer. Temperatures are set to plunge by 5-10C across the country as the warmth and humidity gives way to cooler weather, periods of rain and strong winds. Forecasters have warned of possible hailstorms and thunder in the north.  The drop will be so dramatic that night-time values of up to 19C in the south on Tuesday will exceed peak daytime temperatures for much of the country on Saturday. Arctic air is moving south in thanks to a ridge of high pressure from the Atlantic. Temperatures will peak in the high teens in the south through Sunday, with plenty of cloud cover and periods of rain at times. Maximum temperatures will struggle to get beyond 11-16C in the north, and it will be gusty at times.    Some rural parts of the Highlands in Scotland may even get a frost. It will warm slightly as the wind reverts to a milder westerly flow on Bank Holiday Monday, but people in many places may not notice much of a difference. A spokesperson for The Weather Channel said: “Persistent lower pressure to the north-east and higher pressure to the south-west will maintain a cooler northwest to westerly airflow with lower than normal temperatures and showers.  “Saturday is expected to be the coolest day, before weak higher pressure from the south-west will bring a slight temperature increase.” In its five-day outlook, the Met Office said rain will slowly spread southeastwards through southern Scotland, northern England, Wales and the north Midlands on Wednesday. To the south, there will be sunny spells, and it will remain warm and humid.

Mikey Connors, 30, died following a horse racing collision in Thamesmead, southeast London, on July 28. His funeral, attended by hundreds of mourners, included a 50ft red carpet leading to his grave in Epsom, Surrey, a fleet of 16 Rolls-Royces and a wake held at Leatherhead Wetherspoons. Mourners descended on the Edmund Tylney pub yesterday afternoon, before witnesses say around 50 people became involved in a scuffle. They added glasses were smashed and a number of blows traded in the street outside the pub, reports The Sun. Police were also called to monitor the situation, before one man reportedly sped from the scene in a car.  Businesses nearby reportedly locked their doors as travellers gathered on the street. One mourner was allegedly seen pushing a women while shouting “look what you’ve made me do” with a young boy crying in his arms. Other children were said to be screaming mummy, mummy, mummy, while glasses smashed around them. In a statement, Surrey police said:We were called following reports of a disturbance involving a large group of a people in Leatherhead High Street around 9.10pm. No allegations were reported and no arrests were made. The group of people dispersed of their own accord shorty after officers arrived at the scene. Earlier in the day a white Mercedes funeral car brought Mikey\u0027s coffin to the church as around two hundred people gathered outside to pay homage before going inside. Each of the Rolls-Royces following had two light blue flags with the text \u0027Mikey Connors, our legend, one in a billion, king Mikey - described as a loyal family man - died while horse racing last month. When he did not cross the finishing line, concerned family and friends went back to look for him and made the tragic discovery. His horse also had to be put down because of its injuries.  Mikey\u0027s death will have come as a devastating blow to Big Fat Gypsy Wedding\u0027s Paddy, who has lost several family members in just over a year. Doherty laid his mother to rest in April after revealing she died of a broken heart - following the death of her beloved husband. Known as Queenie, Elizabeth Doherty suffered a massive heart attack just days after a headstone was placed on the grave of her much-loved spouse, Simon. Simon, known as Simey, died a year earlier after battling an illness and his funeral drew hundreds of mourners as he was remembered and celebrated as the father of all travellers.

Pupils at West Side High School in Newark, New Jersey, will now be able to wash their dirty clothes in a laundry room free of charge. The decision was made after a teenage girl fought with school security staff who were trying to check her bag. They later discovered it was because she was homeless and had dirty clothes in her bag, but she didn\u0027t want her classmates to know. Principle Akbar Cook said it wasn\u0027t a one off, any many students don\u0027t have clean clothes to wear.  So when they return for the start of term next year, there will be a free laundry room in the school building. He admits the situation causes bullying at the school, with some pupils picking on their classmates because they are wearing dirty and smelly clothes. Mr Cook told CNN: These are kids, good kids who want to learn, that are missing three to five days a month because they were being bullied because they were dirty.  I even changed the school uniform to darker colors so they could go more days without cleaning them, but even with that, students were struggling to have them look clean enough to attend. The room, which will open for three hours every day, has five washing machines, five dryers and a stock of washing powders donated by people across the country.

Little Charlotte Robinson was staying at Loch Ness Highland Lodges at Invermoriston when Nessie supposedly popped up about 50 feet away - on the first day of her trip. The legendary creature is said to have surfaced for about a minute before reappearing about ten feet further away some seven minutes later - but for less than 60 seconds. Charlotte was on holiday with parents Kat, 41, a business intelligence data analyst, and father Dave, 52, a factory worker. It was at around 7pm last Friday when Charlotte believed she saw the creature and captured it on her phone.  There was something in the water about 50 feet from the shore. I took a photo. It had a neck and head was in the shape of a hook, said Charlotte. I just took what I saw. It was black - I just don\u0027t know how far it was out of the water. I\u0027m not good at judging distances. But after about a minute it disappeared and then came back up again in a different place. It was up for less than a minute the second time. I kind of believed in Nessie, but I wanted to see the proof. I always imagined her as having a long neck and flippers.  I have seen something but I\u0027m not sure what. Mum Kat added: Charlotte said she had taken a photo of a creature in the loch and I said \u0027right, sure you have!\u0027 For weeks she\u0027s been going on about seeing the Loch Ness Monster. But when I saw the picture, I couldn\u0027t believe it. Something\u0027s there. With all the sightings over the years there must be something in the loch.  Nessie expert Steve Feltham - who has dedicated his life to solving the mystery of the Loch Ness Monster for the past 27 years - was astonished by the image. I am totally excited by this photograph - it is the best of \u0027Nessie\u0027 in years, said Mr Feltham. The 55-year-old is recognised by the Guinness Book of Records for the longest continuous monster hunting vigil of Loch Ness. There is clearly a solid object in it and it is relatively clear. It warrants further study.  There may be a mundane explanation such as a seal, but I have not heard of a seal in the loch this year. For my money it is larger than a seal or an ottter. It is a fantastic picture by Charlotte. There have been four recorded sightings this year of the Loch Ness Monster. The last previous glimpse of Nessie occurred on August 5 at 9.38am when a family, regular visitors to the area, were on holiday - also from Leeds.  It has now been accepted by the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings\u0027 Register. After travelling from Drumnadrochit to Fort Augustus they looked out at the loch and spotted a strange looking lump on the surface of the water, which was very still and quiet at the time, said the register. It looked dark brown in colour and \u0027sort of like an upturned boat\u0027. They revisited the area by boat in the afternoon and there was nothing like that in that area. Unfortunately because they were driving and couldn\u0027t pull in, they didn\u0027t manage to get any pictures.

Footage shows the men splashing around in the water and one man can be seen removing his underwear. Tourists can be seen filming the men as they jokingly pose for photographs while flexing their muscles. The incident took place at the famous Altare della Patria (Altar of the Fatherland) national monument in the Italian capital which commemorates the country\u0027s war dead. Police are searching for the culprits after a tour guide filmed their fountain frolic and posted it to YouTube, garnering nearly 40,000 views in 24 hours. Do you know these men? Email webnews@mirror  In the video footage, two men - reported as British by local media - are seen posing for photos in the fountain wearing only their briefs. As summer sunshine pours on the Rome monument, several friends can be seen dipping their feet into the water and taking photos of their semi-naked pals. One of the men pulls his underwear down and stuffs his genitals between his legs to pose naked for photos. Numerous visitors walk past the giggling Brits as they continue to misbehave outside the iconic monument, built to honour Italy\u0027s unification.  The site is positioned between the Piazza Venezia and Capitoline Hill and holds the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier which includes an eternal flame, built in memory of the fallen soldiers of World War I. Local authorities prohibit behaviour that damages or disrespects its famous landmarks and police are trying to track down the misbehaving tourists. Police in Rome have released a picture of the men frolicking in the fountain and said officers are carrying out all the necessary checks to trace the authors of the gesture, which seriously offends the national sentiment and memory of the fallen to whom the monument is dedicated.

The child\u0027s mother became so suspicious of the nanny\u0027s behaviour that she installed the hidden camera, and when she watched the footage back she became so incensed she had to be taken to hospital. She watched in horror as the nanny drank from her daughter\u0027s baby bottle and was even more devastated when she later discovered the nanny was a carrier of hepatitis B. The mum surnamed Zhang hired the nanny in July to take care of her infant daughter while she and her husband were at work.  The Delin housekeeping agency in Jinan, capital of East China\u0027s Shandong province, provided the minder, surnamed Jiang, who they claimed was experienced.  The agency told me the nanny had over 10 years of experience and came highly recommended by other clients, Zhang recalled.   But she quickly noticed problems.  The mum said: She didn\u0027t even know that she was supposed to keep basins used for washing her face and bottom separate. She didn\u0027t seem experienced at all.  She installed a nanny cam a few days later and caught the woman treating her infant daughter roughly, Zhang said.  She had already requested a new nanny from the agency when the hidden camera captured even more shocking footage.  Zhang said she was incensed to the point of needing to be hospitalised when she saw the nanny twisting her daughter\u0027s battle bottle open and drinking from it.   The mum was shocked to learn the woman was also a carrier of hepatitis B. After demanding that the nanny be tested, results revealed Jiang to be a carrier of hepatitis B, which can be transferred by bodily fluids such as saliva.  Zhang complained to the agency, which has claimed ignorance over the matter, saying the nanny provided documents showing a clean bill of health when they hired her.  The mum who has since vaccinated her daughter is now worried she will contract hepatitis B too.  Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver caused by a virus that is spread through blood and body fluids. Many people won\u0027t experience any symptoms and may fight off the virus without realising they had it.

Israa al-Ghomgham has been provisionally sentenced to death in a case which has outraged human rights groups. The 29-year-old has been in prison for more than two years, accused of being involved in protests against the highly conservative government. Among the charges she faced were incitement to disobedience of the ruler in her home city of Qatif, Middle East Eye reports. She is also accused of incitement to protest and providing moral support to rioters.  But she is not accused of being directly involved in any violence. If the death sentence goes ahead, it is believed to be the first time the country - which is trying to convince the world it is becoming more liberal - executes a female activist. Ghomgham was arrested at her home by Saudi security forces in December 2015, along with her husband Moussa al-Hashem. On August 6 the couple were among six people sentenced to death by a court in capital Riyadh. The case will be heard again on October 28, when a final decision on the penalty will be reached.  Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said: Any execution is appalling, but seeking the death penalty for activists like Israa al-Ghomgham, who are not even accused of violent behavior, is monstrous. And Ali Adubisi, director of the European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, told Middle East Eye: “Sentencing a female human rights defender to death is a dangerous precedent in Saudi Arabia. It’s largely a revenge against the Arab Spring, and a punishment for Qatif, which witnessed the largest protests since 2011.  A report by the UN earlier this year stated: Those who peacefully exercise their right to freedom of expression are systematically persecuted in Saudi Arabia. Many languish in prison for years. Others have been executed after blatant miscarriages of justice. Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy where public protests and political parties are banned, is led powerful young Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

I can imagine what she went through.”  Kelly had been married to Craig for a year when they moved to Spain’s Costa del Sol. But she left him after constant rows and they are now in the process of divorcing. She added: “I’m proud of myself for building up the courage to leave him and saying no when he begged me to come back.”   Kelly says she passed a warning to Kay, 46, after the air hostess began dating Craig last year. She has sons aged 14 and 21 from a previous relationship and met Craig while a barmaid in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. Passengers on the Norwegian Star, on a cruise in the Adriatic, say Kay and Craig had a drunken row before Kay plunged from the seventh deck on Saturday night.  CCTV shows her alone at the time. Kay was finally rescued by a Croatian coast guard vessel on Sunday morning. The couple moved in together last November and are said to be living near Marbella.

It was just a terrible performance from the start.“I thought we were slack, very poor in possession.“Ayr had several early corners that put us on the back foot, there were bits of the first half where we got going but it really wasn’t good enough.“As a team, it’s not often I’ve seen so many players off form in one game. It was the polar opposite of Aberdeen last week, against the second best team in the country for the last few years, where we more than matched them.“The players can’t just take plaudits for how well they play and miss chances and then turn in a performance like that, it’s just not acceptable.”Striker Sofien Moussa was dropped to the bench after a poor run in front of goal but did his chances of a reprieve no good whatsoever after his introduction from the dugout.Within 15 minutes of replacing Jean Mendy, Moussa’s continual fouling caught up with him as referee John Beaton gave him his marching orders after a barge on Ayr midfielder Mark Kerr.And to cap things off, centre-back Genseric Kusunga was shown a straight red with the final kick of the game, scything down Michael Moffat in injury time.Neil added: “It was really poor from him, really poor from Gense.“I told Moussa that he can’t be making silly fouls, especially the one where he dived in to try to make a tackle on a yellow card.“It was a very dangerous game and he was warned and then paid the price for a poor challenge.“Then Gense obviously lost his composure and got a straight red which hurts us for this weekend, adding insult to injury.“Moussa had a great impact on the game, getting sent off, but, on the whole, our performance had a greater impact from start to finish, just not good enough.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csaba looks to make signings after taking dundee united squad to aviemore for team bonding","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United boss Csaba Laszlo could still add to his squad before the transfer window closes next week.Over a summer of major change, Csaba has already brought in 13 new players but has repeatedly said he would like to keep part of his budget for near the end of the window.He is still looking at the market and it’s understood there are a number of options he could pursue between now and the final day of business on Friday week.At the weekend there was down time, but not free time for Csaba’s squad as they headed for the Highlands.With no game because of they were already out of the Betfred Cup, he took most of his first-team squad north to Aviemore for a team bonding session.This week it will be back to a normal routine as the build up to Saturday’s home clash with Partick Thistle steps up.Meanwhile, as United continue a forensic examination of the workings on the entire club, it’s been confirmed a number of scouts have been told their services are not being retained.A club spokesman said: “When Mike Martin became chairman earlier this year he said he would conduct a root and branch review of the whole club to improve all areas of the business.“This review includes our academy structure and specifically the resources needed to attain elite status within Project Brave.“The recent changes to our academy scouting network are part of this process.”Today saw the reserves’ league season kick off when boss Craig Easton took the second string west to face St Mirren at the Simple Digital Arena.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7bd8903b433.jpg ","title":"dundee and angus schools share 690k cash for local charities","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSecondary schools from Dundee and Angus have secured a share of £690,000 for local charities through the Youth and Philanthropy Initiative (YPI).Scotland’s 32 local authority regions are taking part in the initiative in which charities will benefit from YPI grants of £3,000 each, directed by a respective school.In Angus, the schools are Carnoustie High (Eagles Wings SCIO) and Monifieth High (Dundee Association For Mental Health).In Dundee, they are Braeview Academy (Women’s Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre), Grove Academy (Tayside Cancer Support), Baldragon Academy (Tayside NHS Board Endowment Funds), Craigie High (Brittle Bone Society) and Harris Academy (Dundee Association For Mental Health).The Future Skills College in Dundee is also supporting St Salvador’s Episcopal Church.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7bd8878bae0.jpg ","title":"green campaign kicks off with adults walking to dundee primary schools","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA campaign to encourage more people to choose green travel options in Dundee was launched at City Square yesterday.Entitled Go Safe Dundee, the initiative saw a group of adults walking to primary schools around the city to raise awareness of the need for pupils and families to consider more sustainable transport.Parents, councillors, council officials and police all set off from City Square at 8.15am.

We’ve got to give Ayr some credit but the defeat was down to us. We weren’t at it at all.“We knew their qualities and had watched them so it wasn’t about under-estimating them.“We just didn’t create enough and were second best for the whole game.“It might be a lesson for some of the new guys, the league is tough and you need to be ready every game.“I don’t even know what to say, to be honest – it’s a hard one to take and we have to pick ourselves up for a big game this weekend at St Johnstone.“We need three points there.”Focus turns completely to the league campaign now after the Betfred Cup disappointment and what has now become a huge game at St Johnstone.The Dark Blues picked up three wins from four against their Tayside rivals last campaign, including a much-needed first victory of the season.That came in mid-September – this time around Kamara is keen to help the side repeat that 3-2 victory by grabbing a first three points of the season.He added: “Hopefully we can repeat that.“We’ll just do our stuff on the training pitches for the week coming up and put our attention now on St Johnstone but we definitely have to look back on the game on Saturday, we can’t just forget about that performance.“There are always other games and it’s a long season ahead but it’s really hard to go out of the cup like that.“We’re always after a cup run so it’s a tough one to take.“We have to pick ourselves up but I know this team is capable of doing that.“We played some good football in the games before Ayr so we know what we are capable of.“The results haven’t gone our way, though, and it’s obvious Saturday just wasn’t good enough from us.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"meekings grateful to dundee boss mccann for captaincy honour","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew Dundee captain Josh Meekings has thanked under-fire boss Neil McCann for trusting him with the armband.McCann has confirmed the former Inverness defender will lead out the Dens Park side for the remainder of the season after trying out eight other potential candidates during pre-season.The 25-year-old Englishman says he is grateful for the honour and has vowed to repay McCann \u0026#8211 who is coming under increasing pressure from fans following his side\u0026#8217s shock Betfred Cup exit to Ayr United on Saturday \u0026#8211 with improved performances.He said: \u0026#8220I\u0026#8217m grateful for the manager for pulling me in to tell me I\u0026#8217m going to captain the side.

He says, though, coming off was just a precaution after needing surgery on the same ankle last season.He said: “It was nothing too serious. I had a shot and rolled my ankle a bit and I’ve had previous with it, so it was a bit of a worry at the time. However, a good bit of rest and the physio saw it. I’ve trained this week and it’s good. I just need to keep an eye on it.”Now would be an unfortunate time for Spence to be ruled out of action after some impressive displays in the early-season games and particularly due to the level of competition in the position now at Dens Park.“Last year there were a lot of centre-mids but again this year we’re very strong there, one of the strongest areas in the team,” he added.“I think that’s good because it keeps everyone on their toes, you can’t slack because there will be somebody else to take your place.“I believe in my ability and I’ve worked hard over the summer, worked hard in pre-season, too.“Obviously, I’ve been in the position but Glen Kamara is to come back and you’ve got Adil Nabi, Paul McGowan, Elton Ngwatala and Kharl Madianga, so there’s a lot of competition in there. I think throughout the season it will be getting rotated round and, hopefully, I can be in that team.“I think I’ve done OK so far. It’s still early but I want to keep this up through the whole season.“Last year I played well in stages and then got injured so I want to play consistently every week, play as much as I can, and obviously help the team climb the table.”And the way to do that will be to start finding the net, something Spence is adamant that’ll change soon.“I think our luck will turn around.“We have to put some of these chances away, we all know that, but the main thing is we are creating chances.“One day it is going to click, something is just missing at the moment but we all believe in the guys up front to go and do it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie dundee united have to make tannadice a fortress to win back wait and see supporters","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAfter a difficult start to the season, something approaching a feelgood factor has returned to Dundee United following victory over Queen of the South in the Championship and a dramatic success against St Johnstone’s kids in the Irn-Bru Cup.This weekend the Tangerines will attempt to build on that by chalking up another success when Partick Thistle visit on the resumption of league hostilities.As well as a chance to build on the new-found momentum, the Jags clash will also be a chance for Csaba Laszlo’s players to send out a message that Tannadice is once again becoming a place where visits are to be feared, not anticipated and relished.While the general perception regarding the failure to secure promotion to the Premiership in each of the last two seasons has been poor away form has been the main cause, there is no question too many points have been let slip at home.In all competitions, last season saw United beaten five teams on their own patch. Three of those defeats came against Inverness Caley Thistle, Morton and Queen of the South in league outings.There were also draws against Dumbarton, Inverness and Dunfermline, meaning a total of 15 points that were expected to be taken were, in fact, shipped.That proved crucial as United finished 13 points behind champions St Mirren and one adrift of second-place Livingston, meaning they kicked off at the first stage of the promotion play-offs, while Livi had the benefit of a two-week break before beating them in the semi-final.Before last week’s Irn-Bru success with a side that was a mix of kids and fringe players, and against very young opposition, there was little to suggest this season would bring an improvement.Over 90 minutes, the Tannadice outings in the Betfred Cup against Arbroath and Alloa were drawn and the opening day of league business ended in a painful 3-2 defeat against Dunfermline that saw the Pars dominate more than the final score suggested.That United must improve at home start is important, not just in terms of their promotion challenge but also economically.The new regime under chairman Mike Martin have invested in a new squad and that’s cost money, some of which they’d like to think will be recouped by fans paying at the gate to watch their team chalk up regular victories at home.Decent income has already come from season ticket sales that are now approaching the 4,000 mark and, if that’s down on previous years, it remains a number that would be the envy of many Premiership clubs.It would be no surprise, however, if that cash has already been spent on the rebuilding of the squad, making supporters who pay on turning up for games a vital source of further funds.In not buying season books, many have adopted a wait-and-see policy so far as attendance is concerned. If United are going well they will come, if not, they’ll find something else to do.That makes wins at Tannadice vital and, in fairness, despite the problems the team’s experienced there in the past 12 months, there are now some encouraging signs.United looked impressive in Dumfries and could’ve scored more than the two goals.And in new arrivals Pavol Safranko, Nicky Clark and Craig Curran, they have strikers who bring as close as anyone is going to get of a guarantee of goals.A more direct style this term should also help, though, ultimately, the proof of this pudding is going to be in the eating.Hopefully, from Saturday the fans can start getting tucked in to what becomes a regular menu of home wins.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic queued for miles near dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTraffic is queuing for miles on the edge of Dundee this morning.The tailbacks are the result of a broken down lorry close to the Myrekirk roundabout.\u0026mdash Traffic Scotland (@trafficscotland) August 22, 2018An HGV has come into trouble in the middle lane of the A90.There is said to be delays stretching as far back as Longforgan.\u0026mdash Traffic Scotland (@trafficscotland) August 22, 2018The HGV was recovered at around 8.45am.Traffic is still said to be heavy, however Traffic Scotland said it should now begin to “ease”.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-collar-melts-into-cats-neck-in-heatwave","story":"                          A WOMAN has issued a stark warning to other cat owners after her furry friend\u0027s newly-bought collar melted into its neck -

Homebase has been one of the most recognisable retail brands for almost 40 years, but the reality is we need to continue to take decisive action to address the under-performance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs.\"The CVA is therefore an essential measure for the business to take and will enable us to refocus our operations and rebuild our offer for the years ahead.\"Retail workers trade union Usdaw says it is seeking \"urgent clarification\" from Homebase owner Hilco over its long-term plans for the firm.National officer Dave Gill said: \"All too often staff are excluded from the CVA process as the future of their jobs is being decided.\"Clearly there is a huge task ahead. It is crucial that the company listens to the staff and invests in their experience and expertise to turn the business around and again make it a success.

Purple had long been the preserve of royals and the elite of society because it was so difficult and expensive to produce.“I’ve been able to develop a method which I believe is more similar to the original.This shows that Perkin was well ahead of his time and that although his discovery was accidental, he understood enough about the chemical process to avoid giving away his secrets to competitors.”Dr Plater said he does not believe Perkin ever fully documented the infamous method he stumbled across to create mauveine.He added: “My research suggests that the samples given to the museums are true to the method used to manufacture the mauveine commercially, but are not the same as the mauveine made by his patented method.“This theory is backed up by the samples obtained from the six pence stamps and evidence from a famous lecture Perkin gave in 1896 where he expressed his concerns about competition.“It seems to me that he never fully revealed what he did to scale up the production of his famous dye.”Dr Plater explains the motivation for this could be related to the difference between the yields produced by the two different processes.He said: “Mauveine is a very difficult thing to make because the yield is very low.“The yields I have been able to reproduce in a lab give around 5% rather than the 1% from his patented method of 1856.“On this basis it is clear to see why a more efficient method was needed for mass manufacturing.“I propose that he used a very early traceless synthesis to modify the composition and improve the yield.“This shows that far from the accidental chemist, he really was a true pioneer of his time.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b7bc0562e975-848x564.jpg ","title":"station opening fit for a queen","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Royal train station has been restored to its former glory – three years after it was destroyed by a blaze.Ballater Royal Station was devastated by fire following an electrical fault in 2015. Aberdeenshire Council pledged to rebuild the station using old plans and photographs as guides.The station was finally opened by Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson who cut the ribbon on the project yesterday.He said: “I think it sends out a real signal because people have had a really rough time with the storm and the fire.“This is an iconic part of the community, reaching right back into history, but we’re bringing it up to the modern day.“A vast amount of work has been done to take it forward, to reflect the old station and what it meant to the community.“I think this will be very much welcomed by the local community.“This is a valuable community asset, and the council wanted to commit to making sure that an iconic building, and part of our history, was brought back to life for wide public enjoyment.”The station was converted to include the royal waiting room in 1886, under the express instructions of Queen Victoria.The royal family would make regular trips through Ballater on their way to nearby Balmoral Castle. The final journey for the royals through the village took place in 1965.Continuing the royal connection, a restaurant inside the station, The Carriage, was opened by the Prince’s Foundation.The charity was set up by Prince Charles, the Duke of Rothesay, to create “harmonious communities”.Robert Lovie, the deputy executive director of the Prince’s Foundation, said the station has been given the “royal seal of approval”.“The challenge was to create a feel inside like people were actually on the platform of a working station,” he said.“The duke has been kept involved throughout the process.“He can actually remember arriving at Ballater as a child on his holidays, so he has great memories of that.“He felt that it had to be done absolutely right and give the people of Royal Deeside back what they’d lost.“I think that he is very happy with how it has turned out.”Businesses are hopeful that the station, which will also include a VisitScotland tourist information hub and the newly relocated Ballater Library, will help to increase tourism.Erek Skene, the part owner of Dee Valley Confectioners, also located in Station Square, said: “Hopefully it will bring more people up to this area of the village.“It’s good for us here and for the whole village. Hopefully we’ll get a boost.”Alan Yule, the owner of A.B. Yule newsagents in the village, said: “It’s lovely, I hope it brings people to us.“It’s been a construction site for three years, so it’s been a bit of a mess, but it’s looking very lovely.”Jo Robinson, the north-east regional director for VisitScotland, said: “This centre represents one of 26 across Scotland and it allows people to come and get some information and inspiration about what to do in the area.“The centre is a real hub, they work with tourism-based businesses in the local area, so they’ll tell the centre what they’ve got going on.”Councillor Geva Blackett, who represents Ballater, said: “It’s the heart of Ballater which really makes it the heart of Deeside.“This is where visitors will come to gather information about what they can do. We’ve got an amazing library which will now be open more.“Hopefully the visitor centre will encourage people to visit the other shops and other parts of the village more.”To ensure the accuracy of the station, a conservation architect was hired, who combed through historical documents, plans and photographs to help recreate the station as it once was.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dees forbes relishes locos test","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBanks o’ Dee co-manager Tommy Forbes is looking forward to the challenge of taking on Highland League Inverurie Locos.Dee meet the Railwaymen at Harlaw Park tonight in the first round of the Evening Express Aberdeenshire Cup.The tie was originally scheduled for August 1, but clashed with Locos’ involvement in the Irn-Bru Cup play-off round.Forbes said: “It’s still early in the season.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mayds talent puts on a captivating performance","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 09/08/18, 1:35 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe children of the Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) put on a theatrical performance of The Magic Brocade for the delight of an audience of parents.The Chinese folk tale was performed in the MAYDS hall by the Monday drama club, bringing fairies and spells to Lochgilphead.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities. In front of the parade was musician Pat Kenny playing haunting tones on a carnyx, an Iron Age Celtic war horn.On the green there were stands selling everything from soap to artwork and woolly bunnets to garden shrubs.As well as battle re-enactments and weapons demonstrations there were living history demonstrations and workshops where adults and children tried their hand at traditional crafts such as spinning, weaving, metalworking, woodwork, dressing up and blowing the carnyx.Children took part in the Lughnasa Games, featuring various tests of Celtic warrior skills.Brian MacLennan of Lochgilphead Community Council said: \u0026#8216The day was a massive success and I\u0026#8217ve had lots of positive feedback.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man. Greta Cameron talked about the early years of the Oyster Bar, established on the estate in the late 1970s by Christina\u0026#8217s brother Johnny Noble along with fish farmer Andy Lane.Piecing together records from her father\u0026#8217s journal, estate records and blending these with the recollections of the people of the estate, Christina has created a remarkable piece of work.This book is not just about the Nobles, but the Ardkinglas community, the people who make it and have made it and the story of how they lived and worked.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m very pleased that so many people have come along today for our launch party,\u0026#8217 said Christina.\u0026#8216Ardkinglas is a place that is very dear to me, and the place and the people have contributed to making me who I am today.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautiful and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"donalds drive to solway trophy inspired by gran","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 17/08/18, 11:43 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSome of Argyll\u0026#8217s rally crews travelled to the Solway Coast near Dumfries for the next round of the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship (STRC) on Saturday August 4.Again the crews were blessed with decent weather at the Dundrennan training camp for the eight stages.

The Labour list MSP hit out as it was announced rail users traveling to Glasgow from Kilmarnock will have to shell out an additional \u0026pound55 for season passes. Regulated rail fares are set to rise by 3.2 per cent, in line with the retail price index rate of inflation, from January. That will see a season pass increase from \u0026pound1692 to \u0026pound1746. Commuters in Ayr would see an increase of \u0026pound78 from \u0026pound2452 to \u0026pound2530 for a season pass. Mr Smyth said: “These rail fare rises are unwanted, unwelcome and unnecessary. “It is simply unfair that commuters in Ayrshire are being burdened with these rip-off rail fares for less than satisfactory services.  “The cost of rail fares being paid by passengers is simply unacceptable, with passengers from Kilmarnock having to fork out \u0026pound1746 a year to travel to and from work. “Scottish Labour is clear: it’s high time working people stopped having to pay such excessive fares to simply line the pockets of private companies. “Only Labour is fighting for a publicly owned railway which will serve the many, not just the few.” Elsewhere, an annual Lockerbie-Edinburgh fare will now cost \u0026pound5250 – up \u0026pound162 – after the Scotish Government decided peak fares were to increase. Transport secretary Michael Matheson said the rises were “unwelcome” and stressed action had been taken to minimise them.  Increases in off-peak fares in Scotland will be held at 2.2 per cent as the government have pledged to cap them at 1 per cent below inflation. All fares in England will rise by the RPI rate of inflation. Mr Matheson said: “This means in Scotland average fares increases are lower than England and Wales.” In recent months staff from rail union RMT have staged protests in cities around the UK. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT, said it was “nothing short of a scandal” that ticket prices were up to five times more than fares in Europe. Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles MSP said the rises are the last thing hard-up passengers need.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartyScottish LabourGlasgowAyrKilmarnockEconomyTransportLockerbieKilmarnock NewsTransport ScotlandCheap travel"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10032349.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/JS94794901.jpg","title":"troon golfers set sky sports","story":"NewsTroon golfers set for Sky Sports appearanceFraser and Freya Russell have qualified for the National final of the American Golf Junior Golf Championships.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet11:31, 22 AUG 2018Updated11:33, 22 AUG 2018NewsFreya and Fraser Russell (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwo superstar golfers have scooped special gongs and are getting set for an appearance on national TV. Fraser and Freya Russell have qualified for the National final of the American Golf Junior Golf Championships. The pair, who live in Troon and attend Marr College, progressed from the qualifying competition held at Leven Links Golf Club and now go forward to the final which will be televised on Sky Sports later this year. Competing in the gross score stroke play competition, 14-year-old Fraser, who incredibly plays off a five handicap at Royal Troon, put in a superb performance to take the qualifier with a score of nine over par. Not to be outdone by her older brother, Freya, 12, put in a fantastic performance to score 32 points in a stableford off a handicap of 13 in the girls’ net score competition. That was enough to take top spot and secure a spot in the final at Gainsborough Golf Club, where she will take on the UK and Ireland’s best girls. Speaking after the qualifier, Fraser said: “I am delighted with how I played, it will be a great chance for me to play golf on a good stage and I can test myself against some of the best.”  And younger sister Freya is looking forward to the continuing her golfing journey as she commented: “I love to play different golf courses, meeting new friends and getting to play golf with other girl golfers.” The pair play their junior medals on the Portland Course at Royal Troon, but due to their impressive handicaps they are allowed to enter in competitions that are played on the par 71 Old Course. They are both coached by Royal Troon pro Kieron Stevenson. Both Fraser and Freya represent Ayrshire for their age levels, and Freya has been playing with the West of Scotland U18 team since she was just nine. And they both played in the World Championships at the stunning Pinehurst course, which held both the men’s and women’s US Open just a year later - won respectively by Martin Kaymer and Michelle Wie.  Pinehurst has also been pencilled in for the 2019 US Amateur Championships and the 2024 US Open. The pair’s dad, Craig, has always played golf and he helped get them into the sport. Craig, who played golf for Cambridge University, said: “They have always been interested in golf. “I took Fraser to play at a young age, and Freya’s first steps were when she got up to pick up her brother’s golf club! “I’ve never forced it on them though, anytime they play golf it’s because they want to, which I think is the key. “They aren’t just into golf though, Fraser plays rugby for Marr and Freya wants to play hockey for her school, and both of them swim.” "},{"url":null,"title":"a68-reopens-to-traffic-after-serious-injury-collision-in-northumberland","story":"THE A68\u0026nbspsouth of the Carter Bar has reopened to traffic following a \u0027serious injury collision\u0027 earlier\u0026nbspthis morning.\nEmergency services were called to the A68 just north of Rochester in Northumberland\u0026nbspbefore 7.30am after a report of a crash between a car and a HGV.\nThe incident closed the road in both directions between Scotland and England for nearly nine hours.\nNorthumbria Police have thanked\u0026nbspdrivers\u0026nbspfor their\u0026nbsppatience and understanding.\nThe A68 at Rochester in Northumberland has been reopened following the earlier collision.

Huntington\u0026rsquos disease typically begins to develop between the ages of 30 and 50.\nIt causes three main groups of symptoms: changes to thinking processes, loss of muscle control and involuntary movements which lead to loss of speech and swallowing, along with mental illness.\nAnd those with the condition may eventually lose the ability to walk, talk, eat, drink or make decisions and will eventually need 24-hour care.

Scottish Borders Council calling for a rethink of its benefits assistance service.\nIn November 2017 the council merged the customer, homelessness, and welfare benefits services to become one integrated department.\nNow, a petition signed by over 200 Borders residents has been handed into Scottish Borders Council, urging the authority to employ officers with a specific remit to assist benefits claimants in applying for welfare. \u0026nbsp\nThe petition further calls on the council to \u0026ldquoensure there are sufficient staff resources within Scottish Borders Council for maximisation of benefit entitlement in the Borders and to \u0026ldquoacknowledge the error made in not carrying out any public consultation on the restructure.\nThe author of the petition and chair of the Borders mental health forum, Jenny Mushlin, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom very concerned that at a time when the benefits system has become so complicated the council has changed its service.\n\u0026ldquoThere are now fewer welfare officers and they are all working across different services.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom hoping this petition will give some understanding to councillors of what people are facing at the moment, and hopefully persuade them to hire more people in the future to help people with filling in of forms and other admin.\n\u0026ldquoThe welfare benefits service was a much loved service which really helped people and the changes were made with no consultation whatsoever.\n\u0026ldquoWe are calling for them to consult with people who claim welfare benefits as to what is needed.\nCouncillors sitting on the Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos audit and scrutiny committee will hear representations from the petition\u0026rsquos authors and from council officers on Thursday, before making a decision on whether to accept or reject the petition.\nAhead of the meeting, Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos service director for customers and communities has written to councillors urging them to take no further action.\nIn her statement, she said: \u0026ldquoThe aim of the restructure was to ensure that the level of service provided continued and in some areas improved, ensuring Scottish Borders Council was prepared for ongoing welfare reform including the rollout of universal credit.\n\u0026ldquoThe Department for Work and Pensions expectation on customers to self-serve online has created increased demands on Council services to assist customers.\n\u0026ldquoPrior to November 2017 the equivalent of 1.7 welfare benefit assistants were employed to assist with basic benefit enquiries including form filling with customers.\n\u0026ldquoWe now have 49 customer advice and support advisors across a wider range of locations, with a remit to assist customers at the first point of contact with their enquiry whether they present in a locality office face to face, over the telephone or online.\n\u0026ldquoThese advisers already deal with a range of benefit enquiries and applications as well as carrying out assessments for blue badges.\n\u0026ldquoThe aim is to provide a holistic service where a customer can speak to the same member of

She told the Courier: \u0026ldquoIt was an amazing experience with half of Manchester out cheering everyone on.  \u0026ldquoThe atmosphere was fantastic, and I think due to the anniversary of the Manchester Arena bombing, there seemed to be an extra sense of \u0026lsquocoming together\u0026rsquo in the city.  Jane was inspired to take on the run by Eliza McKinney, a girl from North Berwick who has Rett Syndrome and whose family have taken on a number of fundraisers to help find a cure.  Jane said that the seven-year-old was \u0026ldquoamazingly brave and, on her JustGiving page, added: \u0026ldquoShe is part of the reason I started running \u0026ndash her bravery, determination and smile inspired me to try and do something to help find a way to help children with this incredibly debilitating, life-altering condition.  Jane told the Courier she was pleased that the money raised was going towards \u0026ldquogroundbreaking work to find a cure for the condition, which mainly affects young girls.  She also picked out her highlight of the run, saying: \u0026ldquoWe all made it across the finish line and got our medals, which was brilliant, but for me the best part of the day was seeing Amber smile and come to life when she recognised part of the route.

More than 10,682 awards were certified for 2,302 candidates across the county.  National 5 pass rates at an A-C grade fell from 78.5 per cent to 75.4 per cent however, the local authority said that this was affected by the removal of monthly assessments which made up a percentage of the final mark.

In maths 37 per cent of pupils received the top grade, while in English 31 per cent did \u0026ndash both going up by four per cent on last year.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.  The seven new citizens who attended were: Christa Gerdwilker (originally from Germany), East Saltoun Mohamed Sherif (Libya), Musselburgh Carmen King (Mexico), Ormiston Bernadette Fitzgerald (Australia), Tranent Diego Onate (Colombia), East Saltoun Gabriele Hegerl (Germany), East Linton John Crowley (USA), East Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-bath-in-butterdean-wood","story":"  BEING surrounded by trees, in a wood where the world outside cannot be seen, is a primeval experience. It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":null,"title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoWe take our service provision extremely seriously and aim to maintain the very high standards of our public toilets.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

A spokeswoman for East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership told the Courier that discussions had been taking place with Haddington GPs on how to support the growing population for \u0026ldquosome time.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe new housing is phased, which enables us to plan ahead.  \u0026ldquoAt the moment we are still looking at a range of options.  \u0026ldquoOf course, the focus on greater multi-disciplinary working coming in now with the new GP contract will allow patients much greater flexibility and swifter access to the right clinical professional at surgeries and other local settings.  Provost John McMillan, a councillor for Haddington and Lammermuir ward, said planning the development of any future health facility had to be carefully weighed up.  Mr McMillan also noted the variety of services which would be included within the new \u0026pound70 million hospital.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is the same issues around working with a town that has got a good town square and you need to look at car parking.  \u0026ldquoWe are looking at that in a measured way and working in partnership.  \u0026ldquoIt is the same with families with young children coming in and an ageing population.  \u0026ldquoYou have to look at schools and the health service as well."},{"url":null,"title":"pear-tree-nursery-set-to-create-up-to-30-jobs-in-haddington","story":"  Pear Tree Nursery has opened a second facility in the town in a former bed and breakfast on West Road.  The new nursery, which saw more than 200 interested parents attend its open day last month, could employ up to 30 staff when it is at capacity, with six already recruited.  Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe wanted a second site because of the waiting list we had at Meadowpark and were delighted to be able to take on the former B\u0026ampB on West Road.  \u0026ldquoOur open day showed how much nursery places are in demand and with all the new houses being built we knew there was a need for it.  \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have a second nursery in Haddington.  The new nursery, which features a giant indoor sandpit and separate baby unit with a sensory room and quiet areas, was officially opened by East Lothian MSP Iain Gray on Thursday, July 26.  He said: \u0026ldquoPear Tree Nursery has been doing a great job for many Haddington families in recent years \u0026ndash including my own grandsons. I have seen for myself on lots of occasions the great atmosphere in the existing nursery, and have watched that reflected in the many national awards Pear Tree has won for the quality of their provision.  \u0026ldquoI was delighted to help open the new Pear Tree on West Road. This is a beautiful building and it has been fitted out to provide the best of care. Not only will it increase the availability of childcare, but it will create a significant number of new jobs in the town too.  \u0026ldquoThis is now a highly qualified and professional sector, and Pear Tree has a great track record on staff support and training, so these are excellent opportunities for local people.  \u0026ldquoWith childcare entitlement expanding and Haddington also increasing in size, this is a much-needed and welcome facility."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

If approved, the merger would follow the expected merger of Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, which have Jacqui McKinnon, headteacher at Cockenzie Primary School, as interim headteacher until their formal merger goes ahead.  According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.  He said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased about it because that is what essentially the research carried out by the community council demonstrated. There was public support for it in Dunbar and it will be good to see it going ahead and I am hopeful the outcome will be positive.  Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe order has been made and we are just awaiting the appropriate signage, which should be within the next month.  \u0026ldquoThe order will be for an 18-month period and is an experimental order.  If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.  The 20mph speed limit starts to the west of Edinburgh Road\u0026rsquos junction with Shore Road and Beveridge Row.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals (Trussell Trust stats).  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent (April 16 to March 17 was 37 per cent increase).  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a variety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010.

She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform (although hair still looking slightly wild as she likes it), she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to (literally) beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations. Currently the world record for players involved in a continuous game of rugby is 442.  Now Haddington RFC president Keith Wallace is waiting for official confirmation that a new record has been set.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.

Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.

Pupils returned on Wednesday, with Ms Cook planning a series of assemblies to introduce herself to the students.  She said: \u0026ldquoI would like to make Knox Academy a flagship school in East Lothian \u0026ndash Scotland, potentially.  \u0026ldquoI want all young people to leave to a positive destination but be healthy and happy as they move through the school and really enjoy their school experience.  \u0026ldquoI want pupils to enjoy education in the widest sense, not just the curriculum but wider activities, and to develop as rounded individuals when they leave school to meet the demands of an ever-changing society.  Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.

She said: \u0026ldquoI found when I was at Trinity Academy, the headteacher and the senior leadership team were in the middle of the school.

Ahead of the new term starting, a section of the extension has been opened, which will give access to six new classrooms.  More than \u0026pound10 million is being spent on the extension, which includes a new two-storey L-shaped block to the east side of the school.  It will not only be home to new classrooms but also a home economics department, new library and learning centre with a dedicated IT space, and additional PE changing rooms.  Mrs Slowther, who has previously worked at both Knox Academy in Haddington and Ross High School, Tranent, felt it was a \u0026ldquophenomenally exciting time for the school.  The 36-year-old, who is joined by Ed Offer and Richard Maxton as depute headteachers, as well as Suzanne Hamilton as acting depute headteacher, said staff were taking the school into a new era.  The new headteacher, who was previously a biology teacher, added staff had talked about what they could do \u0026ldquoto preserve what is really special and how we continue delivering absolutely the best education for every young person that comes through our doors.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"whats-on-this-weekend-five-ideas-of-things-to-do-in-east-lothian","story":"  1.

He accepted more than 3.5 million dollars in return for approving loans for Dmitrij Harder, then principal owner of Chestnut Consulting Group, based in Southampton, Pennsylvania, in the United States.  At the Old Bailey on Wednesday, Sanderson pleaded guilty to concealing, converting or transferring criminal property between September 2007 and March 2010.  The court heard the money remained in the bank accounts \u0026ldquooutside the jurisdiction but had not been touched by Sanderson, who lives in her parents\u0026rsquo multimillion pound flat near Hyde Park.  Prosecutor Tom Little QC said a further bribery charge would not be proceeded with by the Crown.  Sanderson, of Sussex Gardens, west London, was granted conditional bail to be sentenced by Judge Nicholas Cooke QC at the Old Bailey on September 25.  Her guilty plea followed a long-running bribery case which led to convictions in Britain and the United States.

It comes as he faced calls to create a \u0026ldquoprogressive international of socialists to counter the rise of the far-right.  The Labour leader revealed he was in touch with left-wing movements throughout Europe and the world, including US senator Bernie Sanders.  He has also been invited to the inauguration of Mexico\u0026rsquos new left-wing, anti-establishment president Andres Manuel L\u0026oacutepez Obrador.  But at Edinburgh International Book Festival, former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis urged him to be \u0026ldquoa bit more ambitious and help create a worldwide movement.  He said this was necessary to counter the rise of the far-right, and argued \u0026ldquothe fascists are increasingly united.  Mr Varoufakis pointed to former Donald Trump strategist Steve Bannon\u0026rsquos efforts to bring together far-right movements and politicians across Europe, including Italy\u0026rsquos deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini, Hungary\u0026rsquos Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u0026aacuten and Austria\u0027s governing coalition.

The tests are supposed to help teachers assess the academic levels pupils have achieved when they first come to school.  They are then used to judge progress throughout their school career with further testing in P4, P7 and S3.  However, critics argue testing five-year-olds is meaningless because levels of maturity are so different.  There have also been concerns that pupils have found the assessments stressful - partly in cases where whole classes have sat the tests against government guidance.  Joanna Murphy, chair of the National Parent Forum of Scotland (NPFS), praised the information from the assessments.  In a letter to The Herald she said: \u0026ldquoI have seen sample results ... and the information available to teachers is exceptional.  \u0026ldquoIt provides details of a child\u0026rsquos specific skills, knowledge and understanding, which enhances the teacher\u0026rsquos judgement.  However, Ms Murphy said a full understanding of the roll-out and purpose of the assessments had never been passed on to parents.  The NPFS previously suggested that letters should be sent to all P1 parents to ensure they fully understood the Scottish National Standardised Assessments.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey [Scottish Government] believed it would result in unnecessary profile raising, but as we made clear, and we are now seeing, when there is a vacuum of information it allows for fear and anxiety to spread.  \u0026ldquoWhat is of most concern is that parents are not getting the clear, balanced information they need to be able to decide whether assessment is right for their child.  \u0026ldquoThis issue is wider than the standardised assessments, it is about a repeated lack of good direct communication from schools, local authorities and Scottish Government to parents.  Tavish Scott, education spokesman for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, accused the government of \u0026ldquodeliberately confusing parents over their right to withdraw children from national testing.  Advice on whether pupils can opt out has been conflicting with some internal documents suggesting the test are not compulsory.  The most recent government statement says there is no formal legal right to withdraw - because the tests themselves are not statutory - but suggests parent should talk to their school if they want to opt out.  John Swinney, the Deputy First Minister, welcomed the view that standardised assessments could provide \u0026ldquoexceptional information.  He added: \u0026ldquoParent organisations worked with the Scottish Government to co-produce information leaflets for parents, carers and teachers about the standardised assessments which were sent to all schools last summer.  \u0026ldquoWe expect schools to communicate effectively with parents, and parents can talk to their child\u0026rsquos school at any time.  \u0026ldquoFollowing a review of the first year of assessments, we will shortly set out changes and enhancements to the system for this year, including enhanced communication with parents.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced the assessments as a response to concerns over falling standards of literacy and numeracy and a lack of consistent data across the country. However, critics claim they are too stressful for the youngest pupils."},{"url":null,"title":"first-womens-football-game-in-europe-was-played-in-carstairs","story":"  A minister\u0027s objection to women joining in a kickabout on a Sunday in Carstairs, Lanarkshire, in 1628, saw players branded \u0027insolent\u0027.  The Rev John Lindsay condemned women and men playing football on the Sabbath as it was expected to be a religious day devoted to solemn reflection and worship.  A church document dated August 21, 1628, revealed: \"Mr John Lindsay, minister at Carstairs, having regretted the break of the Sabbath by the insolent behaviour of men and women in footballing, dancing and Barley Breaks, ordains every Brother (Minister) to labour to restrain the foresaid insolence and break of Sabbath, and to that effect to make intimation thereof into their several kirks next Sabbath day.\"  Experts believe the venue for the match was Carstairs\u0027 village green where the village\u0027s church originally stood.  The find has been hailed by politicians and academics on the 390th anniversary of the letter being penned.  Aileen Campbell,\u0026nbspMSP for Clydesdale, said: \"As Clydesdale\u0026rsquos MSP, I am thrilled that Carstairs in my constituency is the location of the first recorded women\u0026rsquos football game in Europe.  \"It is therefore fitting to be welcoming the game \u0027home\u0027 as we promote women\u0026rsquos football and encourage women and girls to take up sport.  \"As a football fan, I am delighted to see women\u0026rsquos football continue to grow and develop.

Vivienne MacLaren, of Scottish Women\u0026rsquos Football, said: \"Scotland has a proud history within the women\u0026rsquos game and we are delighted to acknowledge that women\u0026rsquos football has been present in Scotland for 390 years, far longer than most people would imagine.  \"As custodians of women\u0026rsquos football in Scotland we also welcome the launch of the first seminar to be held to share ideas and develop the game in Scotland.\"  Britain\u0027s first recorded international women\u0027s football match was played in Edinburgh in May 1881.

According to the Life Of Saint Mungo, written by the monk Jocelin of Furness in about 1185, St Enoch was cast out by her family after becoming pregnant.  She eventually settled in Culross, Fife, after being taken in by St Serf, who ran a monastery.

At the age of 25, he began his missionary work on the banks of the River Clyde, close to where he built a church that forms part of Glasgow Cathedral.

It followed an apparently innocuous reference to Scotland\u0026rsquos role in the hunt for the elusive Higgs Boson, or \u0026ldquoGod particle, named after the Edinburgh-based physicist Sir Peter Higgs.  The phrase was dropped after a blistering report from a Brighton-based firm of media consultants, which was published yesterday on the Scottish Government website.  There was also brutal criticism of a boast in the draft campaign that Scotland had produced arguably the best James Bond in Sir Sean Connery.  That was dismissed as \u0026ldquoobtuse and \u0026ldquofacile when compared to another boast about Scotland helping to develop the world\u0026rsquos first cancer vaccine.  \u0026ldquoHow is that an achievement? was the summary of the \u0026ldquobest 007 claim.  Ministers were also told images of children could deter potential visitors.  A list of \u0026ldquodon\u0026rsquots included \u0026ldquochildren put people off (avoid on holiday), and while a shot of a castle was considered essential, the advice declared \u0026ldquochildren can be a negative.  Golf was also \u0026ldquopolarising, with \u0026ldquominority appeal, and an over-familiar image of Scotland.  The 110-page \u0026ldquoinsight findings were released under Freedom of Information law.  Produced by Lucid People (UK) Ltd, they gave feedback and advice on an early version of the promotional campaign now being aimed at in North America, London and China.  A joint project by ministers, VisitScotland, Universities Scotland and Scottish Development International, the aim was to show Scotland as a great place to visit, study, work and invest.  The original plan was also to \u0026ldquokick-start an advocacy-driven movement that would lead people round the world to view Scotland \u0026ldquoas a great brand.  However the media consultants said large parts of the draft campaign, which initially considered using the slogan \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos Calling or \u0026ldquoGo Scotland, were a duds.  Messages aimed at visitors were the most successful, followed by those for businesses.  But the research found many people were left \u0026ldquoconfused, disengaged and/or irritated by efforts to build a Scottish \u0026ldquobrand, including a film featuring Austin Powers star Mike Myers.  Out of character, Mr Myers was \u0026ldquonot recognised by many of those on whom the material was tested, and the film left people struggling to understand it, \u0026ldquoeven after explanation.  The \u0026lsquobrand\u0026rsquo material was \u0026ldquounclear, \u0026ldquoself-congratulatory and too focused on the past.

The June 2017 findings were used to hone the campaign ahead of its launch this year, when Nicola Sturgeon declared it would \u0026ldquoinspire people to be part of Scotland\u0026rsquos future.  The report also revealed some of the image problems facing Scotland.  Among the starting perceptions in the US were \u0026ldquocastles and fog and \u0026ldquonothing to do.

The area this year has often been and packed with people, both audiences and people trying to walk, and yesterday at the Annual General Meeting of the Fringe Society, concern was raised about the conditions of the space during the festival.  The chief executive of the Fringe, Shona McCarthy, said the Mound, a man-made hill that connects the Old and the New Towns, surmounted by the Scottish National Gallery and the RSA building, would be the next public space to be revamped after significant changes were made to the Royal Mile artist performance this year.  However, how the changes will be implemented will depend on the major revamp to the National Gallery, which the National Galleries of Scotland are currently planning.  She said: \"This year we have completely reviewed the High Street, and how it looks...and I think the new stages, the accessibility platforms have been really well received.  \"I agree there is still work to be done on The Mound, and next year that will be a priority for us.  \"We need to reconsider how we manage the street performers on the Mound, there are bottlenecks, there are places that could work better for us.\"  A street performer at the AGM, Silver, said that the space was now cramped and \"a disaster\".  He blamed the National Galleries of Scotland for, several years ago, erecting railings outside the gallery buildings, reducing the amount of room, including steps, for the public to gather on.  \"Picture families sitting on those steps,\" he said.  The area at the bottom of the Playfair Steps, lined on one side by stalls, is often extremely difficult to navigate, he added.  He added: \"Think about this fence, it has destroyed the area, if you want to make it better, get rid of that.\"  A spokeswoman for the Fringe said that the changes did not mean the removal of street performers, but a performance and facility revamp similar to the one experienced on the Royal Mile.  There has been much debate this summer about the use of public space in Edinburgh during the festival.  The erection of black boards on Princes Street to shield the view of the Summer Sessions gigs in Princes Street Gardens led to controversy and their partial removal.  Oliver Davies, head of marketing at the Fringe, added: \"We\u0027ve done a lot of work on the High Street this year, one of the reasons we did not extend that to the Mound is that the National Galleries of Scotland have a long standing application to redevelop their footprint on the Mound.  \"We felt it was right to hold off, and we are still not sure what that impact might be, it will affect that space to some extent.\"  A spokesman for the National Galleries of Scotland said that the railings outside the National Gallery, while not always present, were part of its listed status.  The detail of the new revamp of the gallery will be revealed in the near future, he noted."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-to-welcome-delegates-to-international-culture-summit","story":"  The fourth Edinburgh International Culture Summit will run from Wednesday to Friday at the Scottish Parliament.

The UK deficit was 1.9 per cent of GDP in the same year.  Public spending in Scotland was a record \u0026pound1576 higher per head than in the rest of the UK thanks to a cross-border subsidy from the Treasury.  The Scottish Tories said the \u0026lsquoblack hole\u0026rsquo in the nation\u0026rsquos finances showed why the SNP should drop any plans for another independence referendum.  The GERS figures showed Scotland\u0026rsquos finances would have been in an even worse state than previously thought in the first year of independence had there been a Yes vote in 2014.  Last year, GERS said the deficit had been \u0026pound13.3bn, or 8.3 per cent of GDP, in 2016/17.  However these have now been revised to \u0026pound14.5bn and 8.9 per cent of GDP.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspSturgeon urged to apologise over inaccurate independence forecasts  The White Paper on independence launched by Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond forecast a manageable deficit of between \u0026pound2.7bn to \u0026pound5.5bn, or 1.6 to 3.2 per cent of GDP.  The difference was due to the oil price slump after the 2014 referendum.  The GERS figures also showed a record \u0026lsquoUnion dividend\u0026rsquo of \u0026pound1982 in 2016/17 after revisions compared to \u0026pound1882 in 2017/18 and \u0026pound952 in 2013/14.  This is the difference between how much Scotland contributed per head to the Exchequer and received back in public spending.  In 2017/18, Scotland\u0026rsquos per capita tax revenue was \u0026pound306 lower than the UK level and spending was \u0026pound1576 higher.  Just seven years ago, Scotland was a net contributor to the Treasury, at \u0026pound200 per head.  The new data did however show a marked upturn in Scotland\u0026rsquos geographical share of revenue from the North Sea, which was up from \u0026pound266m in 2016/17 to \u0026pound1.3bn.  Overall, Scotland generated 8 per cent of UK revenue last year, had 9.3 per cent of public spending, and accounted for 34 per cent of the UK\u0026rsquos \u0026pound39.3bn deficit.  Ms Sturgeon said the figures showed the Scottish economy was in a \u0026ldquostate of recovery, but Brexit remained a \u0026ldquoreal and present danger.  She highlighted growth in the onshore economy in Scotland had been faster than in the UK.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspScottish economic growth outstrips that of UK in 2018  The SNP\u0026rsquos recent Growth Commission, its revised economic blueprint for independence, envisaged a year one deficit of around 8.3 per cent, more than in 2017/18.  \u0026ldquoThat would suggest the trajectory in more positive in reality than the Growth Commission assumed, Ms Sturgeon said.  To the dismay of many on the left of the independence movement, the Commission proposed keeping a tight rein on public spending to halve the deficit over 10 years.  Ms Sturgeon said cutting the deficit was important, but not if it meant austerity.  She said: \u0026ldquoFiscal rules should not become counter-productive. So if actually what the economy needs is stimulus to get the economy growing faster, that\u0026rsquos what should take priority. The Growth Commission was an explicit rejection of the kind of austerity economics we have seen in recent years.  She said the 3 per cent deficit target in the Commission was \u0026ldquoa reasonable one, but added it was important not to become \u0026ldquoso fixated on that that it becomes counterproductive.  Asked if the \u0026pound1576 extra public spending per head would look fair to voters south of the border, she said it was \u0026ldquomore than fair given the history of North Sea oil receipts.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspSturgeon denies SNP tried to \"con\" voters over independent economy  Ms Sturgeon refused to apologise for the even wider gap between the official figures for the putative first year of independence and those in the White Paper.  She said: \u0026ldquoI would defy anybody to say that they foresaw what happened in the North Sea and oil revenues. That\u0026rsquos what changed the projections.  \u0026ldquoWhat we see here today is an improving position, as oil improves and as our onshore [economy] improves. Don\u0026rsquot lose sight of the fact that onshore revenues excluding oil and gas are up by \u0026pound2bn. That is faster growth in onshore revenues than UK growth in onshore revenues in the same year.  \u0026ldquoWe have a Scottish economy that has had a difficult time in the last few years because of the position in oil. Notwithstanding that we have had strong onshore growth and we see that picture continuing here.  Finance Secretary Derek Mackay added: \"The latest economic data points to an improving picture in Scotland. Our economy grew twice as fast as the UK in the most recent quarter, while unemployment remains close to its record low and confidence is returning to the oil and gas sector.  \"Overall revenue in Scotland reaching \u0026pound60bn for the first time ever, underlining the fact that we have a productive and growing economy, despite the UK Government\u0027s London centric economic policies.  \"Meanwhile, Scottish exports of goods have increased by 12 per cent over the past year - the fastest rate of growth of any nation in the UK - with huge potential for further expansion in key overseas markets.\"  Scottish Tory MSP Murdo Fraser said: \u0026ldquoIf Nicola Sturgeon wants to continue her threat of second referendum, she has to explain where she would find \u0026pound13bn to fill this deficit.  \u0026ldquoAssuming that can\u0026rsquot be done, the prospect of another divisive and unwelcome vote must be removed for good so Scotland can focus on what really matters.  \u0026ldquoYet again, the union dividend has been made clear.  \u0026ldquoBy being part of the UK, Scotland received an extra \u0026pound1576 for every man, woman and child last year above the UK average. For a family of four, that\u0026rsquos more than \u0026pound6000 in additional public spending.  \u0026ldquoIf Scotland was to be ripped out the UK, this spending would be slashed drastically, meaning schools, hospitals and infrastructure would be hit.  \u0026ldquoAny Scottish Government would also have to massively increase taxes and borrowing to help make up the difference, something the hardworking public simply wouldn\u0026rsquot accept.  \u0026ldquoAnd while Scotland\u0026rsquos finances improved slightly on the whole last year, the rest of the UK\u0026rsquos have done even better, meaning the gap is now bigger. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said: \u0026ldquoPeople across Scotland are sick and tired of austerity \u0026ndash and these figures show that the SNP\u0026rsquos plans for independence would mean unprecedented levels of austerity for Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe SNP\u0026rsquos plan to close Scotland\u0026rsquos deficit is a cuts commission \u0026ndash a vision which protects the interests of big corporations and the privileged few instead of our vital public services.  \u0026ldquoThe dividing line in Scotland is now between Labour\u0026rsquos plan to invest and build an economy that works for the many, not the few, or further austerity with the SNP and the Tories.  Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said: \u0026ldquoThese numbers are another cruel blow to the Nationalists, coming from their own government.  \u0026ldquoIt adds to the misery set out in the SNP\u0027s Growth Commission.  \u0026ldquoWhichever way you look at it, under nationalist plans all the good things we all want to do in Scotland would be under threat because of funding cuts. Investing in people through education and mental health would be harder under independence.  Scottish Green MSP Patrick Harvie added: \u0026ldquoHere we have another reminder that the Scottish economy is still too focussed on oil and gas extraction instead of making the needed transition to clean and sustainable renewable sources of energy.  \u0026ldquoWhile other parties use this annual publication as justification for how Scotland couldn\u0026rsquot be a small, successful independent country, or how great the SNP government thinks it is they\u0026rsquod do well to remember that both our prosperity and our climate depends on moving to a clean economy.  Professor Graeme Roy, director of the Fraser of Allander think tank, said: \u0026ldquoGERS takes the current constitutional settlement as given.  \u0026ldquoIf the very purpose of independence is to take different choices about the type of economy and society that we live in, then a set of accounts based upon the world today will tell us little about the long-term finances of an independent Scotland.  \u0026ldquoBut GERS does provide a pretty accurate picture of where Scotland is in 2018. So in doing so, today\u0026rsquos numbers set the starting point for a discussion about the immediate choices and challenges that need to be addressed by those advocating new fiscal arrangements.  Mike Tholen of\u0026nbspOil \u0026amp Gas UK\u0026nbspsaid the GERS data showed a \"striking transformation\" of the UK oil and gas industry since the downturn.

Fresh questions about the acquisition have emerged after the Financial Reporting Council said BHS could have been insolvent when it was sold, and slapped PwC with a \u0026pound10 million fine for its discredited audit of the company ahead of the deal.  The Pensions Regulator is now arguing Mr Chappell knew the company was bust at the point of sale, as part of its bid to seize \u0026pound9.5 million from him for the BHS pension fund, sources told the Press Association.  The regulator claims that, because of this, he should have funded the acquisition fees himself, rather than taking the cash out of BHS after the acquisition.  It is understood that the regulator\u0026rsquos contribution notice relates to around \u0026pound8 million in professional fees to firms such as Grant Thornton and Olswang, and \u0026pound1.5 million that Mr Chappell extracted himself.  Mr Chappell is challenging the regulator, saying he was unaware of the true state of finances at BHS.  PA understands Grant Thornton and Olswang were not given access to group accounts when they performed due diligence on the BHS sale and relied largely on information certified by PwC.  Mr Chappell said: \u0026ldquoHad they [PwC] done their job correctly we would never have touched BHS with a barge pole.  A spokesman for PwC said: \u0026ldquoThe audit failings did not contribute to the collapse of BHS over one year later.  The Pensions Regulator has dropped all action against Sir Philip after the Topshop boss contributed \u0026pound363 million to the BHS pension fund black hole.  The Insolvency Service has also stopped short of seeking to ban Sir Philip from acting as a company director.  Mr Chappell, however, is being subjected to disqualification proceedings.  The former racing driver is also embroiled in a separate case with the Pensions Regulator, having been found guilty of failing to provide officials with information on the BHS pension scheme.  Mr Chappell will appear in Hove Crown Court on Friday as part of an appeal against the conviction, with a re-trial of the case due to take place in September.

Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.

He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Wednesday 22 Aug 2018 2:42

after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau (CAB), stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Wednesday 22 Aug

No personal information will be gathered as part of this.Evidence suggests that across Scotland more than a quarter of people in education have struggled at some point in the previous year to access sanitary products with some girls and young women having missed school or skipped classes because they didn’t have access to products.The Scottish Government, local authorities and the university and college sectors have therefore committed to providing free access to sanitary products in all schools, colleges and universities in Scotland beginning from the new academic term.Further information can be found at  www.young.scot/periods.\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Accompanied by a support boat, Mr Cameron, 40, reached the shore on the other side, near Duncansby Head, sometime just before 8.20pm tonight.Mr Cameron decided to take on the seven-mile swim across the Firth in memory of his girlfriend Ena Brown, who died suddenly earlier this year. Money raised through the challenge will be going to the Kirkwall Maternity Ward, where Ena had worked.Speaking tonight, Monday, following the swim, he said: \u0026#8220It was a grind, I was swimming for over four hours and I never stopped for one second, I just ploughed on the whole way.\u0026#8220It was quite choppy to start with but it got better as I went on. Things eased off after about an hour or so. I knew I had it in me, I was just worried about the conditions changing and having to pull the plug, so I couldn\u0026#8217t relax during the swim. I went through all sorts of emotions \u0026#8211 I was confident and I had moments of doubt.\u0026#8220That last hour was a real grind, I must confess. I could see Duncansby Head in the foreground and I didn\u0026#8217t think I had long to go, but I was scared to ask. I had thought I had about 15 minutes to go, but I had an hour-and-a-half to go. It was real tough going.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220I\u0026#8217ve done marathons, I\u0026#8217ve won Scottish championship surfing titles, but that\u0026#8217s the toughest thing I\u0026#8217ve done.Asked how he felt following the swim, he replied: \u0026#8220I feel a big weight off my shoulders. If this hadn\u0026#8217t happened this week we would have been looking at next summer. I feel I\u0026#8217ve achieved something, I know this has been done before once or twice before, but this is something I will remember for the rest of my life. It\u0026#8217s very rewarding.

Indeed, the evidence suggests that the capital grants previously available have made a real and positive impact.“Everyone agrees that encouraging new blood into farming is vitally important, including here in Orkney. At a time of real uncertainty for the sector, there is a need for the government to help provide what stability it can.“It is all the more surprising therefore that the minister has chosen to take this decision now.  I have written to Mr Ewing, who is due to visit Orkney next month, asking for a reassurance that the government does not intend to walk away from supporting new entrants and ensuring agriculture in Scotland has a bright future.”               \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Made with footage culled from up to 240 cameras that captured both the initial launch and the nine-day mission that followed, the film is a vital scientific document, a portrait of late \u0026#821760s America and a visually cogent exploration of man\u0026#8217s place in the universe.With an original score by Charles Morrow and a commanding narration by Laurence Luckinbill, the documentary won a special award at the Cannes Film Festival. However, for the next few decades, it was practically forgotten even the original printing elements were lost.Christopher Riley is a film producer, director and writer specialising in science, engineering and history. His work has been celebrated by BAFTA, the US Television Academy, the Royal Television Society, the Sundance Institute and the Grierson Trust.He is a regular contributor to  newspaper and presents science documentaries for BBC Radio 4. In 2007 he tracked down Theo Kamecke — who was working as a sculptor in upstate New York — and found that he held the only remaining 35mm print. Working closely with Theo, Moonwalk One was re-mastered, combining a unique 35mm director’s cut with newly transferred 16mm NASA flight film media, to create a new HD digital master of the film.This will be the first chance to see the new high-definition Blu-ray version of the film which is due to be released next year.Moonwalk One: The Director\u0026#8217s Cut is on at West Side Cinema, Stromness Town Hall, Saturday, September 8 at 7.45pm.

This will also improve the availability of recycled material for use in the production of bottles and cans in future.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to provide their views on how this scheme can meet Scotland’s needs and help us tackle our throwaway culture.”Iain Gulland, Chief Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “Scotland’s planned deposit return scheme is a landmark in the nation’s circular economy journey, with the potential to drive inward investment and create jobs in Scotland at the same time as improving recycling and reducing litter.\u0026#8221Consultation available to view.            \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Her cooking was what initially drew clients to come to the centre and her baking, he said, was \"legendary\".This theme was echoed by speeches from Ina Mackenzie, Mina Stewart and Kerry Watson.

Hopes for a visitor trail around an area that was heavily militarised during WWII are now full steam ahead after the project team behind the Aultbea museum secured almost \u0026pound73,000 from the Scottish Land Fund towards the purchase of a former butcher\u0026rsquos shop it has been renting to house the display.People from 19 countries outside the UK were amongst the 5500-plus visitors dropping in between May and October last year and that number is set to mushroom as the facility is improved and plans for a wider trail developed.The project\u0026rsquos chairman Francis Russell told the Journal: \"To some extent we have become masters of our own destiny. This opens up new avenues of funding. The location on the NC500 is very important.\"We ask people when they come in how they heard about us and some say it was while they were driving by. It puts us on the map. We\u0026rsquoll look at the feasibility and cost of a major refurbishment and possibly an extension. We could do with much more space.\"Fellow project volunteer Elizabeth Miles said the boost \"will allow us to get on to develop it the way we would like\".She said: \"Owning the site will open new possibilities. We will look to create a WWII trail where everywhere gets visited. We\u0026rsquore hoping to really do something with it.\"Research found the NC500, which passes the makeshift museum, brought 29,000 extra visitors in its first year, adding an extra \u0026pound9m to the Highland economy.The \u0026pound72,820 award will contribute towards the purchase of the former butcher\u0026rsquos shop and surrounding land.Honorary president of the RACP George Milne said the aim is to create a multi-site museum for current and future generations to learn about the convoys.He said: \"The overall aim is to establish a unique multi-site museum in Wester Ross. Around Loch Ewe we hope to create a permanent exhibition centre, a WWII Trail with interpretation panels, a memorial garden, and the preservation of selected wartime buildings to honour all who served in the Arctic convoys to and from Russia from 1941-1945.\"\u0026nbspThe 75th anniversary of the last convoy to sail from the area will be marked in 2020, with relatives of servicemen and visitors from around the world expected to come in their droves.Gairloch Heritage Museum, which itself secured backing from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Highlands and Islands Enterprise for a \u0026pound2m project to convert the old anti-aircraft operations room in the centre of the village into a state of the art new facility, welcomed the news.It said: \"Congratulations to our friends at Russian Arctic Convoy Museum on procuring the funds to purchase their exhibition centre.

All my sculptures contain a memory and I felt it apt that this particular work should be imbued with the feeling of being held in a loving embrace, feeling safe and secure enough to develop your potential.\"The Shelter of Your Arms is one of a collection of pieces created by Ann on display throughout the garden and in the Sawyer Gallery within Inverewe House.Operations manager Kevin Frediani said: \"As a result of the Gulf Stream meeting the Highlands, Inverewe Garden is a nirvana of unusual and wonderful plants and wildlife. Through our arts and exhibition programme we are providing visitors with another dimension to the garden and new way to enjoy Scotland\u0026rsquos national and natural treasures, as our reputation as a centre of arts and culture grows.\"The exhibition is open now and runs until August 30.Last month, NTS unveiled its vision of a proposed new 20m viewing tower within the garden.The plans, which have been submitted to Highland Council for consent, would see an observation tower overlooking Loch Ewe.If given the go-ahead, the tower would provide unique panoramic views for visitors with, according to the NTS, minimal impact on surroundings and could be used to host educational talks.A spring 2019 opening is planned if all goes according to plan.The attraction has enjoyed a surge in visitor numbers after recent investment including the renovation of Inverewe House, the development of the new Sawyer Gallery and Bothy Caf\u0026eacute and new glasshouses.Wednesday 22 Aug 2018 2:43 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.\"It\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it. We also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it.\"Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, there has only been one known red squirrel road death locally, with none reported so far in 2018. The year before, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area and two others further away.The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig village, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian forest.Local climber Chris Hingley worked with Becky to install the bridge last June 2017, with support from Highland Council.

She said: \"All the neighbours were out watching. The road was like a volcano.\"She said: \"If they patch this now, it\u0026rsquoll only burst another six weeks down the line further down.

He said: \"The most cost effective way would be to renew the pipe rather than having to call in squads of repairmen each time.\"A spokesman for Scottish Water apologised to customers affected and said the performance of mains is closely monitored \"to target investment where it is most needed, recognising that replacing water mains typically involves higher cost and further disruption for residents, whereas targeted repairs can often restore reliable service\".He said: \"Given the deteriorating performance of a section of the main serving customers in Knockbreck Avenue over recent months, this has now been identified as a priority and we will therefore be replacing the length of water main where bursts have occurred. We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Wednesday 22 Aug 2018 2:44 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

And if we get that referendum, Scotland would vote to stay in the EU by an even bigger majority than we did before – 66 to 34 per cent.            This shows why we, the people of Scotland, should be allowed to take back control of the process we started in the referendum of June 2016.As a Liberal Democrat MP who represented a Scottish seat at Westminster for 28 years, I unequivocally support a People’s Vote, since Brexit is the biggest issue facing our country in a generation.The SNP’s current voters want to stay in the EU by a margin of 83 to 17 per cent, while they back a People’s Vote on Brexit by a margin of more than four-to-one - 66 to 18 per cent, once ‘don’t knows’ have been removed. Labour’s current supporters in Scotland would vote to stay in the EU by a margin of 74 to 26 per cent and support a People’s Vote by 64 to 21 per cent.READ MORE: Poll: Only a quarter of Brits back Theresa May over Brexit            The public view on Brexit is shifting and it is incumbent on all of us from across the political spectrum who believe in democracy to come out on one side or the other of this crucial debate in our history.This includes all political parties, including those with large mandates both at Holyrood and at Westminster. In history, our leaders will be judged on their actions today, not their warm words, when it comes to the fight for a People’s Vote on the final deal.Two years on from the 2016 referendum, we find ourselves in a position where the promises made by those cheerleading the Brexit campaign are neither being met nor are likely to be, as the Government and its Brexiteer stalwarts desperately try to convince themselves that Brexit, as promised by the Leave campaign, can actually be implemented.We will end up paying a £50 billion-plus divorce settlement for a worse relationship with our EU partners than the one which we enjoy today.             We will enter a 21-month transition period from 30 March next year onwards, where not only will we have to implement all EU rules and laws but we will have no say over them. We risk losing control over the Northern Irish border where Brexit raises real concerns that the troubles of the past could rear their ugly head again.READ MORE: SNP warns no-deal Brexit leaves Scottish economy facing devastationAs for the Brexit Cheerleaders, they have either dodged cabinet responsibility – as in the cases of Boris Johnson and David Davis – or they have looked to remove themselves from the mess they have created. Jacob Rees-Mogg is on record as having defended the move by a City firm that he helped to found to establish an investment fund in Ireland and Nigel Lawson is seeking the right to live in France.The British people have a record of standing up for what they believe in and, as the polls show, have no intention of being hoodwinked.

Only by having its own currency can Scotland build the independent country that it wants to build.”            The think-tank, helmed by Robin McAlpine, says that the Growth Commission plans will lead to an independent Scotland using Sterling until at least the year 2039.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK.

Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nWednesday 22 Aug 2018 2:44 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117085.jpg","title":"Dalwhinnie makeover starts to take shape","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nDALWHINNIE is on the verge of a major makeover at its southern entrance.\nFor too long dogged by a disused, overgrown compound and a rusting old water treatment works, villagers are now beginning to hope that things could change dramatically over the next few months.\nAll being well, they heard on Tuesday, a \u0026pound2.3 million upgrade by Scottish Water could get under way in the new year which would leave the village with a new treatment works by this time next year.\n\"There\u0027s a long way to go,\" said the north\u0027s corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel when the Strathy met with an SW team in the village hall, \"but we\u0027re hopeful that all the many stages will be gone through on schedule.\n\"We are having to consult with a lot of different individuals and organisations \u0026ndash not least the national park authority, the Highland Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and landowners \u0026ndash but this is work which will have to be done on behalf of the community.\n\"Quite simply the current system has reached its sell-by date.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27433  ","story":" Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nWe all need to be able to draw inspiration from history, past sacrifice, leadership and determination.\nLifelonganti-apartheid campaigner and veteran of the national liberation struggle inSouth Africa, Ronnie Kasrils was in Belfast and Derry recently to launch hisnew book ‘A Simple Man’.\nMartinMcAuley asked me to interview Ronnie for a Sinn Féinvideo.\nMy lastquestion was to ask what continues to inspire him and his vision for thefuture.\nHeexplained how much today’s youth inspire him, and in particular young AhedTamimi from the occupied territories in Palestine.\nLastSunday Ahed was released from prison.\n\nI mether daddy in Ramallah three months ago.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary (better known as ‘Nana’) Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system. In 2017 just 391 people took part in newly established apprenticeship programmes, compared to the government’s target of 800. - Maurice Quinlivan TD\nSinnFéin has today published its policy proposals to reform the apprenticeshipsystem in Ireland. The party’s spokesperson for Business, Enterprise andInnovation Maurice Quinlivan TD has announced proposals to increase the numberof people in apprenticeships to 60,000 by 2023, whilst also branding thecurrent government’s reform plans as “unambitious, uninspiring and unacceptablyslow”.\nThe document outlines Sinn Féin’s proposals to reform the system in ways suchas trebling the number of apprenticeship programmes currently availablealongside focusing on plans to increase the female \u0026amp people withdisabilities participation rates within the programmes. \nDeputy Maurice Quinlivan said\n “Thegovernment is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming theapprenticeship system. In 2017 just 391 people took part in newly establishedapprenticeship programmes, compared to the government’s target of 800.\n “Inaddition, only nine of the promised fifteen new apprenticeship programmes wereintroduced last year.”\n SinnFéin has also outlined the benefits of an all-Ireland apprenticeship system andthe benefits that would come with including trade unions in the development andgovernance of the programmes. The document reiterates Sinn Féin’s aim toabolish student contribution fees for apprentices and details how the partywill promote apprenticeship programmes as another tertiary education choice.\n Apprenticeshipis a tried and proven way for employers to develop highly skilled workers fortheir company and industry by using a mixture of coursework and practical onthe job learning. Record numbers of students are attending third leveleducation, but with this route not being suitable for everyone, Sinn Féin wantsto create more alternative routes for young people.\nDeputyQuinlivan continued\n“AcrossIreland we lack significant alternative opportunities for young people topursue other education. We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people. To date, none of thismoney has been drawn down from the EU.”\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27460  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nLet\u0026#039s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0026#039s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nThis Saturday the 50th anniversary of the first organised civil rights march in the North will be marked with a commemoration march from Coalisland to Dungannon. \nThe original march, held on August 24, 1968, was the first to be organised by the Civil Rights Association in the north, which was founded the previous year to challenge the institutionalised discrimination and injustice of the Six County state. \nIt was stopped at an RUC cordon before it reached its destination at Market Square in Dungannon but the organisers went ahead with their protest and held speeches at sang the civil rights anthem, \u0027We Shall Overcome\u0027, at the police cordon. \nAn estimated 2,500 people took part in the original march fifty years ago. \nThe Coalisland to Dungannon march was followed by a march in Derry on October 5 1968 which was brutally attacked by the RUC. The attack on the marchers was carried out in front of the news cameras, brining global attention to the civil rights campaign and the the discrimination of the unionist regime at Stormont. \n\nThis Saturday\u0027s march, organised by Sinn Féin, is the first in a series of events planned to mark the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the civil rights campaign. \nMid Ulster Sinn Féin MP, Francie Molloy, who helped organise and took part in the original parade 50 years ago, said that the campaign for rights is as relevant now as it was in 1968 and encouraged people to take part in Saturday\u0027s march. \n\"Presently, with the deliberate denial of rights, a shortage of affordable housing and the ongoing issue of constituency boundary proposals, it is clear there is still a job of work to be done,\" he said. \nWith the DUP\u0027s denial of rights to the LGB\u0026ampT community, Irish language speakers and bereaved families awaiting inquests, it is clear the campaign for rights needs to continue in the north.

Deputy Head Boy Zak Trawinski is celebrating the achievement of three A* grades, while Shealyn Caulfield received two A* grades and an A grade. \n  \n73% of the College’s Year 14 students are celebrating at least one A grade in their ‘A’ Level results this week, with 43% also celebrating at least one A* grade.\n  \nYear 13 students have also enjoyed considerable success in their AS Level courses, where an encouraging number of students have achieved A grades.\n  \nSt Patrick’s College Principal, Dr Martin Knox, congratulated all of his ‘A’ Level students on their outstanding level of achievement.\n  \nHe said: “I am delighted to see so many of our students achieving at this top level and it is testament to the effort that they and their teachers have put into their ‘A’ Level work over the past two years.\n  \n“22 of our students have achieved at least two A grades out of their ‘A’ Levels, and I am delighted that we have a 98% pass rate across all of our courses to celebrate.\n  \n“ A particular word of congratulation must go to our Art, Construction, ICT, Performing Arts, Polish and PE Departments, which saw 100% of their students achieve grades at A*-C. \n  \n“All of our Year 14 Construction and Sport students achieved Distinction grades. I particularly congratulate the students who achieved three A or A* grades.\n  \n‘We are very pleased that such a significant number of our students have achieved three of their ‘A’ Levels at A*-C, and I am delighted to say that our students have achieved excellent results in both their AS and A2 courses.\n  \n‘We have many Sixth Form students who come to us from other schools when they have completed their GCSE courses, and their success at ‘A’ Level shows how well they settle into life here at St Patrick’s. \n  \n“ It is notable that three of these students are among our very highest achievers.’\n  \nDr Knox congratulated and thanked his staff for the support, guidance and advice offered. He further congratulated the students’ parents.\n  \nFurther success has been achieved at AS Level, where St Patrick’s students have completed a highly successful first year of their ‘A’ Level courses.\n  \nA third of all grades achieved at AS Level were at A*-B grades, an outstanding achievement on the part of both students and teachers. Dr Knox also offered his congratulations to these students as well as the Transition Course students.\n  \nDr Knox concluded by wishing the Sixth Form students who will be leaving the College this year every success in the future as they move on to Further and Higher Education and into the world of work. \n  \nHe thanked them for the outstanding contribution they have made to the school, and also for the example they have given younger pupils at St Patrick’s, through their excellent academic performance, their work as Pupil Mentors to the younger pupils.\n  \n Undoubtedly they have followed the school’s Mission Statement of living and practising their faith and their commitment to one another. \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_935979.jpg--.jpg?1534836294000\n","title":"blooming great display of 175 000 sunflowers","story":"  \nA PORTGLENONE family have spread a little bit of sunshine as 175,000 tiny seeds have blossomed into huge bursts of yellow sunflowers.\n  \nThe McAllister family have created a the spectacular attraction at the Gortgole Road with their wildflower meadow and sunflower display, which has seen people from far and wide flock to see the stunning blooms.\n  \nCool FM presenter and leading blogger, Melissa Riddell, has even visited the floral field, not once but twice and her snaps on instagram among the giant sunflowers have seen a surge of visitors to the site.\n  \nThe initiative was the brainwave of Damian McAllister, whose father Eamonn owns the land on which the three acres of flowers span.\n  \nThe idea was conceived as a way of raising money for the building fund of the local chapel, St Mary’s, Portglenone.\n  \nDamian sowed the seed at the end of May utilising an old technique of sowing with a fiddle.\n  \n One acre is devoted to wildflowers, with intricate hues of yellows, purples and reds while the huge sunflowers take up two acres.\n  \nSpeaking to the , Damian’s wife, Karen, said: “We have been overwhelmed at how much support we have received.\n  \n“We opened the gates on Saturday and it was only supposed to be open on Saturday and Sunday but we have been so busy and people just keep on coming.\n  \n“So we’ve decided to keep it open.\n  \n“My husband planted the seeds in late May and the conditions, with the warm weather and rain, have ensured they have flourished.\n  \n “They are continuing to bloom and the children who visit absolutely love it.\n  \n“It is good fun, they can play games like hide and seek.\n  \n“But, it’s educational too.\n  \n“They can learn about nature and see the flowers as well as ladybirds and bumble bees!\n  \n“We have even been in touch with the local Beekeepers Association.\n  \n“There are a number of varieties of flowers here including Corn Cockle, Marigolds, Chamomiles and Cornflower.\n  \n“There are 175,000 sunflowers with the tallest so far reaching 7ft!“\n  \n“So many people are visiting and news of it is spreading through word of mouth and social media, with Melissa Riddell really giving us a boost.\n  \n “We have even had a request from a bride who wishes to have her wedding pictures taken here next week!\n  \n“We also had an 80 year old lady visit who said she hadn’t seen a field of sunflowers like this since she was in her 20s in France!\n  \n“It really made her day!\n  \n“The reception to this has been totally unexpected but it’s been great!”\n  \nEamonn McAllister, owner of the land, said: “Usually we don’t have the climate here for the sunflowers but they have bloomed this year.\n  \n“It was a novel idea and we have been very busy with visitors from all over.\n  \n“It is like paradise for bumble bees here!\n  \n“We have enjoyed it and so far we have raised \u0026pound1,500 for the chapel.\n  \n“We’d be happy to do it all again next year!”\n  \nVisitors have been thoroughly enjoying the local attraction with one woman telling the : “It is a real treasure on our doorstep!”\n  \nAnd visitors can also take away their very own sunflower!\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":null,"title":"65300  ","story":"                \nBALLYMONEY Foodbank has seen an almost 20% increase in usage since the introduction of Universal Credit in November 2017.\nThis is the disturbing news revealed by a Director of the local Foodbank after they recently compiled figures covering this past year. \nCo-Director of Ballymoney Foodbank Mr Peter Rawlins said: We looked at the number of vouchers dealt with, the number of people helped and the weight of food distributed in the six months leading up to November 2017 and in the five months after November 2017 (excluding December which is always a peak month for any foodbank) and we found there was an 18% increase in first five months of this year. \nMr Rawlins continued: This is a significant increase on the previous six months and on the corresponding months the previous year. Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie. A remote service after Friday\u0027s first two stages would work for everyone.

And it’s an ideal venue to host birthday parties and school or group outings.”\n\nAir-tastic currently has two trampoline parks, located in Bangor and Cork, with a number of other Air-tastic trampoline parks planned to open in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in due course. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor further information on Air-tastic and the Craigavon trampoline park opening visit www.air-tastic or search Air-tastic Craigavon on Facebook.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602227.1534344744!/image/image.jpg","title":"can you help a history project","story":"\nDid you ever work in the old Mayfair manufacturing company in Portadown? If so, then Mayfair Business Centre would like to hear from you.  \n\n                \nThe present day Mayfair Business Centre is inviting former workers who were employed at the sewing factory to discuss their memories and experiences of working there. This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols","story":"\nThe Education Authority (EA) has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland return to school in the coming days.\n\n                \nA spokesperson for the EA offered the assurance in response to media coverage revealing that the authority had considered removing “lollipop men and women” in a bid to save money.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA letter obtained by BBC News NI revealed that the EA faces an estimated funding gap of £58 million in 2018/19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt highlights a number of “difficult choices” the authority is faced with in order to cut costs, including the possible removal of school crossing patrols, withdrawing uniform allowances and making compulsory redundancies in schools.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAccording to the BBC, EA board members regarded the possibility of scrapping school crossing patrols – and other potentially controversial savings measures – as “unpalatable” and decided that any decision to make such cuts should be down to the Department of Education.\n\nThe letter also suggests that “traffic control measures” are not the EA’s responsibility, but that of the Department for Infrastructure and the

for school crossing patrols in the current financial year.”\n\nManned crossings are seen as a vital for the safety of children crossing busy roads, and the DUP’s education spokesman said any move to

Education Authority and the department have to explore every option to live within budget, this idea cannot be regarded as a serious suggestion and it is clear that the members of the Education Authority would reject any attempt to propose it,” said Peter Weir MLA.\n\n“The safety of our children must be paramount, and there is no need to remove the current process for assessing individual placements of lollipop people provision.”\n\nThe Strangford MLA continued: “This bizarre suggestion does however highlight two key issues. Firstly, the extent to which education is effectively subsidising other elements of government particularly on road safety and transport and there needs to be a debate about where financial responsibility is borne. \n\n“Secondly, it further shines a light on the heavy pressures facing education in Northern Ireland, and the need for strategic changes and reform which need commitment on an Executive-wide basis, which again highlights the damage being done by a single party putting their narrow interests ahead of proper decision making and the restoration of government.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602298.1534346604!/image/image.jpg","title":"fifty years on from first civil rights march","story":"\nOn August 24, 1968, Northern Ireland\u0026#8217s first civil rights march took place between Coalisland and Dungannon. \n\n                \nOn the march were teachers, students and politicians who all wanted the same thing, equality and civil rights.

Cllr Lyons said it It would be fitting if the road was named after one of Belfast’s greatest ever footballers.\n\n“After famously signing for Liverpool FC in 1912 for ‘£1 and the price of the boat trip’, Scott would be a key player in Anfield for an incredible 22 years, making 468 first-team appearances. He holds the record as Liverpool’s longest serving player to this day. The earliest recorded football chant was Liverpool fans cheering his name. Scott is widely considered the first King of the Kop. \n\n“But it’s not just his time in Liverpool that’s worthy of celebrating. Elisha returned to the Donegall Road in 1934 to become player-manager for Belfast Celtic. Over the following 14 years, he would secure 31 trophies with the Grand Old Team, including 10 Irish League titles, six Irish Cups and eight Gold Cups. Belfast Celtic were the powerhouse in local football and the club still retains a loyal and dedicated fan base. \n\n“Scott also knew what mattered in football and when challenged amid worsening sectarian tensions in the 1930s, for fielding a cross community team he responded in his trademark forthright style, ‘I don’t play Protestant players. I don’t play Catholic players. I play good players.’ Scott’s success as both player and manager secured his place in history but his dedication to his club, players and fans ensured his place as a legend of the game.”\n\nYou can vote online at https://dof.belfastcity.gov.uk/NameTheRoadVote/  or by emailing NameTheRoad@BelfastCity.gov.uk with Elisha Scott in the subject and including your name and address.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"lisa smyth increased workforce cant keep up with demand","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

People are living longer and are also getting sicker.\n\nConditions such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, hypertension and depression are all on the rise, and more people are being diagnosed with a combination of these illnesses. The fact is the increased workforce is not keeping up with demand.\n\nOf course, clerical staff play a vital role in keeping the health service running but it is somewhat troubling to hear that there is almost one person performing administrative roles to every nurse in the health service.\n\nIt is even more concerning when you hear that nurses are sharing desks with 16 other people and spending up to an hour filling in a form every time a patient is admitted to a ward.\n\nIt\u0027s a vicious circle inadequate remuneration and a crushing workload are not an attractive prospect to anyone looking for a job, yet while we struggle to fill vacancies, working conditions will never improve.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"one in five of northern irelands health service staff in administration or clerical posts report","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Admin and clerical staff form the second biggest staff grouping.\n\nThe figures come as the health service plunges deeper into a workforce crisis which is causing misery for both patients and staff.\n\nIn recent years, a shortage of doctors and nurses has been blamed for the closure and reduced opening hours of emergency departments and other crucial services.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u0027s hospitals have a shortage of 1,800 nurses, while it has been claimed that overstretched GPs are living in fear of making a fatal error because of their heavy workload.\n\nIntolerable work conditions are leading to a growing number of doctors and nurses choosing to leave Northern Ireland.\n\nThe situation has been criticised by two former health ministers. Former Ulster Unionist MLA Michael McGimpsey said the health service could not be expected to perform without proper resources.\n\n\"When I was health minister I reduced the amount of health trusts down from 19 to six and took 3,500 administrative jobs out of the system,\" he said.\n\n\"I\u0027ve been away for a long time but one in five seems too much.\"\n\nOn the continuing shortage of nurses and doctors, he said: \"These are the sins of the past coming back to haunt us.\n\n\"In my day we were graduating around 700 nurses per annum for the health service - that was allowed to fall away dramatically.\n\n\"There has been a major dip over the past six or seven years. Similarly, there was a dip in the number of doctors.\n\n\"There are more nurses employed now but it is relative to need. Workforce planning is key, you have to have the right number of people in the right place at the right time to address the needs of patients.\n\n\"It\u0027s no secret we don\u0027t have enough doctors, nurses and health professionals. We don\u0027t have enough beds or paramedics.\n\n\"There\u0027s a shortage all over and that\u0027s why the health service is struggling.\n\n\"There is a lot of talk about big initiatives like the Bengoa report, but the health service does evolve to meet changing circumstances. The problem is that the budget is inadequate to employ the people you need.\"\n\nJim Wells MLA, who has had the DUP whip withdrawn following his criticism of the party leadership, said health trusts are drowning in bureaucracy.\n\n\"When you look at these figures, there is clearly an imbalance between medical staff and admin staff, although the trusts would probably argue these staff are necessary,\" said the former health minister.\n\n\"These new figures have highlighted the very real problem that the health service is experiencing.\n\n\"With my wife, Grace, being unwell, I get to see first-hand the effect a shortage of nurses and doctors is having on our health service.\n\n\"I\u0027ve spent many, many hours in hospitals and in the nursing home where Grace lives and I\u0027ve lost count of the number of times I have watched someone on the phone begging nurses to come in on their days off.\"\n\nJanice Smyth, head of the Royal College of Nursing in Northern Ireland (RCN), said nursing shortages will continue until health officials address a number of fundamental issues. These include a pay disparity between nurses here and those working throughout the rest of the UK, and increasing training places.\n\nShe said: \"The increase in nursing numbers since 2014 isn\u0027t as high as for dentists, doctors, social services and professional and technical staff, which is significant. As for the number of administrative staff, we have long said that our nurses are tied up doing admin when they should be nursing.\n\n\"For example, there are nurses in the community who have to drive around with no administrative or IT support, go back to an office and share a desk with maybe 16 other nurses.\"\n\nYesterday\u0027s report showed that, as of March, the health and social care sector employed 65,265 (56,803 WTE) people on either a full-time or part-time basis. The Belfast Trust is the largest trust in Northern Ireland, employing 31% of all health and social care staff (17,777 WTE).\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern irelands political parties spending tops 25m latest","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"quaker funding for belfast charity with alleged dissident links must be stopped unionists","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The group offers a mediation service for people threatened with paramilitary \u0027punishment\u0027 attacks. \n\nThe Times yesterday reported that the charity had been under investigation by the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland for the past 16 months.\n\nMr Beattie said: \"I have very real concerns about the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust funding Conflict Resolution Services Ireland. All funding should be stopped immediately to allow for investigation of the charity.\"\n\nEast Belfast DUP MP Gavin Robinson said: \"Serious questions must be answered by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust and the Charity Commission must ensure a full investigation is carried out.\"\n\nMr Robinson said it was \"in the interest of public security and transparency\" that all questions about funding were addressed.\n\nFormer CRSI employee Carl Reilly (42) faces directing terrorism charges. He was arrested in 2015 after police swooped on CRSI offices on the Falls Road and Ardoyne Avenue, seizing documents and computers.\n\nThe items taken belonged to Republican Network for Unity (RNU), which gives political advice to dissident organisation Oglaigh na hEireann (ONH), and its prisoner support group Cogus.\n\nIn a statement, the trust said it had \"no relationship with armed groups or proscribed organisations\".\n\nIt said its \"demilitarisation funding\" was \"only for those organisations which are committed to tackling the legacy of conflict-related violence and are seeking ways to bring about positive change in their communities\".\n\nThe trust said that The Times reported \"historic allegations\" against four people associated with CRSI. \"Three out of four of these allegations relate to periods before the individual concerned became associated with the charity,\" it said. \n\n\"In the fourth case, the individual\u0027s employment with the charity was terminated after his arrest.\" \n\nThe statement continued: \"During a two-year period leading up to their most recent grant, CRSI sought to mediate on behalf of 704 individuals who felt they were under threat of paramilitary violence.\n\n\"CRSI were able to successfully resolve almost all of these cases: protecting lives and reducing harm. CRSI have also made a significant contribution by their engagement with republicans who are outside the peace process.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brazilian community to celebrate popes ireland visit with portuguese mass","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We go in to local communities, have a cup of tea and we join in with the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group walk the Grand Canal Way at Ballycommon, Offaly (Brian Lawless/PA)\n\n\n\n\n“Each individual walks for themselves, there’s no-one telling them how fast or slow to walk.\n\n“We get a bus back to Nenagh each night which means we are sleeping in our own beds and get a good rest before starting fresh in the morning from where we ended the night before.\n\n“We hope to arrive in Inchicore in Dublin on Saturday evening then head home and come back on Sunday morning and walk the two and a half miles (four kilometres) to Phoenix Park in time for the Papal mass.\n\n“The will will carry us there.”\n\nFor Patricia Finn, this will be her second time seeing a Pope in Ireland after travelling to Limerick for Pope John Paul II’s visit in 1979.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pilgrims carry Irish and Vatican flags (Brian Lawless/PA)\n\n\n\n\nExplaining her reason for the epic walk, she said: “I wanted to do this for lots of reasons, mostly for myself, then to join in with neighbours and friends who are walking to bring a big failte (welcome) to the Pope and for the joy of coming through all the different communities.\n\n“This event is about families and about community.\n\n“We are taking each day as it comes.”\n\nWillie Keane, also from Nenagh, said taking part in the pilgrimage and walking is like “food for the soul”.\n\nHe added: “That’s exactly what we have encountered on this journey – we are going back to the simple things.\n\n“The Pope is coming and we want to celebrate that, it’s a joyous occasion.\n\n“As we walk along each person can take time to reflect, we are getting away from our mobile phones and touching the earth and connecting with nature. That’s priceless.\n\n“There is no hardship in this. We are seeing the hidden Ireland, it’s magic.\n\n“Every town we go to there’s a different story to tell and while our journey is a simple one, communities are responding.”\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37240406.ece/cfbbe/AUTOCROP/w620h342/Pope_in_Ireland_008.jpg","title":"pope in ireland thousands expected to line dublin streets for pontiff parade are you going","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards. Additional rail services will also run across both days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"canary islanders face recreated 600 years after culture","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

of the indigenous cultures, leaving behind little information about them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarina Osswald, of the University of Dundee, has now recreated the face of a Guanche woman using her skull.\n\nShe said: “The true identity of the Guanche people has long remained a mystery – with the literary accounts of invading Spaniards being some of the only real information left about these intriguing indigenous people.\n\n“During this project, I ended up learning so much about the Guanche and I hope her image will inspire others to find out more about this ancient population.”\n\nThe exact age of the skull remains unknown but it predates the extinction of Guanche people 600 years ago.\n\nIt was found in an unknown burial site on the Canaries around the 19th century and then donated to the University of Edinburgh Anatomical Museum.\n\n\n\nRecent literature suggests that the appearances differed between each island\nKarina

skull during a visit to the Anatomical Museum.\n\nThe student said: “What I’ve created is a best0guess estimate as to how one of these islanders would have looked.\n\n“However, recent literature suggests that the appearances differed between each island of the Canary archipelago.\n\n“This could mean, with further research, we may one day get a clearer idea of the individual differences between each Guanche island group.”\n\nHer work is currently on display as part of this year’s Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art \u0026 Design Masters Show.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"corrupt bankers

bribes.\n\nhttps://www.belfasttelegraph/news/uk/corrupt-bankers-sister-admits-role-in-laundering-27m-in-bribes-37241648.html\n\nhttps://www.belfasttelegraph/news/uk/article37241647.ece/0f3e2/AUTOCROP/h342/bpanews_bb17eda0-6e3b-47f3-98a2-8572394c46fe_1\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sister of a corrupt banker has admitted her part in laundering 3.5 million US dollars (£2.7 million) in bribes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nMother-of-three Tatjana Sanderson, 39, let Channel Island accounts in her name be used to bank the money for Anglo-Russian sibling Andrey Ryjenko.\n\nAt the time, Ryjenko, 45, was employed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in a role which required him to consider equity investment and loan applications from firms.\n\nHe accepted more than 3.5 million dollars in return for approving loans for Dmitrij Harder, then principal owner of Chestnut Consulting Group, based in Southampton, Pennsylvania, in the United States.\n\nAt the Old Bailey on Wednesday, Sanderson pleaded guilty to concealing, converting or transferring criminal property between September 2007 and March 2010.\n\nThe court heard the money remained in the bank accounts “outside the jurisdiction” but had not been touched by Sanderson, who lives in her parents’ multimillion pound flat near Hyde Park.\n\nProsecutor Tom Little QC said a further bribery charge would not be proceeded with by the Crown.\n\nSanderson, of Sussex Gardens, west London, was granted conditional bail to be sentenced by Judge Nicholas Cooke QC at the Old Bailey on September 25.\n\nHer guilty plea followed a long-running bribery case which led to convictions in Britain and the United States.\n\nLast June, Ryjenko, 45, was jailed for six years after he was convicted of conspiring to make or accept corrupt payments and transferring criminal property following a five-week trial at the Old Bailey.\n\nSanderson had been declared unfit to stand trial but the jury decided she was involved in the corruption as a matter of fact.\n\nMeanwhile in the US, Harder, the former owner and president of Chestnut Consulting Group Inc, was jailed for five years for bribery.\n\nHarder, 45, of Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, had pleaded guilty in April 2016 to two counts of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\nIn sentencing, US District Judge Paul Diamond ordered Harder to forfeit 1.9 million dollars (£1.4 million).\n\nLast year, Elspeth Pringle, from the CPS, said: “Andrey Ryjenko repeatedly abused his position of power within a publicly-funded bank by accepting corrupt payments.\n\n“Despite his efforts to disguise his crimes, the prosecution was able to present a compelling case to the jury, resulting in his conviction and jail sentence.\n\n“This conviction was made possible through effective cross-border partnerships between a number of jurisdictions, including the United States.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"manchester bike hire operation could be suspended in

We must all work together to keep our city safe and moving.”\n\nMobike bicycles are picked up and left without the use of docking stations such as those used by Transport for London’s so-called Boris Bike scheme.\n\nUsers download an app which employs GPS technology to show them where the nearest available bicycle can be found. They then scan a QR code to release a lock.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"is this toddler the youngest art blogger in the uk","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.
