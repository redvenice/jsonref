First he filed chapter 11 bankruptcy, claiming he \u0027couldn\u0027t afford\u0027 the $5million demo cost. That was dismissed.Then he filed an appeal against Judge Karlan\u0027s order to tear down the giant house. That too was denied.He went to California\u0027s Supreme Court to try to save his project. But the state\u0027s highest court torpedoed his efforts, refusing even to hear the case.Still undeterred, Hadid\u0027s lawyers filed a second appeal - this time against Judge Karlan\u0027s decision to appoint a receiver to oversee destruction of the house. He lost that appeal as well.Last month, Hadid\u0027s legal team filed a third appeal, this one against the $2.9 million judgment awarded to the neighbors by the civil trial jury."},{"url":null,"title":"Teacher enters SIXTH year project replicate Bayeux Tapestry shes halfway there","story":"Share this article Miss Hansson started work on the replica in July 2016 and had hoped to finish within 10 years.She said she fell behind schedule after first buying a puppy and later embarking on a home renovation project, adding: \u0027All going well I\u0027ll come in at 11 years rather than 10.\u0027The full-time carer for her disabled stepson said that she started sewing aged \u0027four or five\u0027. \u0027My nan taught me cross stitch basically to keep me quiet and stop being naughty,\u0027 she said.She started sewing Viking re-enactment clothes in 2001, \u0027you can\u0027t go and buy those clothes in H\u0026ampM\u0027, and \u0027became quite good at it\u0027, getting orders from \u0027friends and family, museums and schools\u0027.\u0027Six years ago I didn\u0027t have any orders coming in,\u0027 she said. \u0027I got bored trying to think \u0027what can I make next\u0027 So I thought I need a project I can\u0027t finish in a hurry.\u0027She said she heard of someone making a half-size replica of the Bayeux Tapestry and decided to do a full-size one herself.\u0027Because what\u0027s the point of doing it half-size?

The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) has surveyed 1,000 businesses, and found that a majority said it has created problems such as pushing up costs, increasing paperwork and delays, and putting the UK at a competitive disadvantage. The BCC received 59 comments on the merits of the TCA, which was agreed on Christmas Eve 2020, including: But this was outnumbered by 320 comments criticising the deal, such as: William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said smaller firms are particularly suffering from the change to trading relationships between the UK and the EU. The BCC has made a number of suggestions, including moves to reduce the complexity of exporting food, and tackling limitations on business travel and work activities in the EU. Last week, MPs on parliament’s spending watchdog warned that Brexit red tape has damaged Britain’s trade with the EU. They fear the situation could worsen unless the government works with Brussels to reduce hold-ups at UK ports, A Government spokesperson, though, says businesses are getting support to help with Brexit changes:  But there is evidence that UK trade has weakened over the last few years. UK exports of goods to the EU were down £20bn last year compared with the last period of stable trade with Europe, according to official figures marking the first full year since Brexit.  Elsewhere today, companies such as Nestlé , Reckitt Benckiser and Standard Chartered are reporting results. European markest are set to open a little lower, with the Ukraine crisis firmly in focus. The US has said that Russia has deployed another 7,000 troops to the border, while Ukraine has denied claims by Russian-backed separatists that it has conducted mortar attacks on their terrirory. In New York, stocks have opened lower as the Ukraine crisis continues to worry investors. The main indices are in the red, shortly after president Joe Biden told reporters that a Russian invasion could happen in the next “several days”. Biden described the chance of conflict in the region as “very high.” Biden’s comments came after Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg  said the alliance is concerned that Russia is “trying to stage a pretext for an armed attack against Ukraine”. In another step, Russia has expelled the deputy US ambassador to Moscow, Bartle Gorman. Associated Press has more details: “Spiraling inequality is a major issue in our society, and all the evidence suggests this is deeply damaging to our collective morale and trust,” Williams said.  Williams told the super-rich they should not view paying back to wider society as a tax burden but as “an opportunity to build a stable, sustainable economy that works for everyone”. Here’s the full story: The Centrica-owned energy firm has pledged to ringfence the £294m it holds in credit balances through direct debits from its 7 million customers in a bank account separate from funds it uses to run the day-to-day business. “I think that in any other walk of life using over £500m of customers’ money to prop up a business that subsequently failed would be considered a national scandal,” said Chris O’Shea, the chief executive of Centrica.  Housing starts in January fell to an annual rate of 1,638,000, from a December estimate of 1,708,000. That could be a sign that rising borrowing costs are weighing on the sector. If so, that would be a blow to efforts to increase housing supply, and address the shortage that pushed prices to record levels. But it’s also due to the freezing weather which hit the US last month, with Winter Storm Izzy bringing heavy snow and damaging ice to the southeastern US, disrupting power supplies and forcing flights to be cancelled. There were 248,000 initial claims in the week to Saturday February 12, an increase of 23,000 on the previous seven days. That’s more than economists had expected, but still close to pre-pandemic levels. Jobless claims hit their lowest since 1969 late last year, falling below 200,000 as firms held onto workers in a tight labour market.  Back in April 2020, they hit a record at above 6m, as firms shed staff early in the pandemic.US car safety regulators have opened an investigation to assess potential safety issues in certain Tesla vehicles after users reported “phantom braking.”   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has started a formal investigation into 416,000 Tesla vehicles over reports of unexpected brake activation tied to its driver assistance system Autopilot. The preliminary evaluation covers 2021-2022 Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in the United States after the agency received 354 complaints about the issue over the past nine months. Earlier this month Tesla updated its “Full Self-Driving” software, to fix a situation where cars would roll through stop signs without coming to a full stop. Those cuts sent the lira slumping to record lows, driving up import costs and creating an economic crisis. The CBRT said that the pandemic, and rising ‘geopolitical risks’ were creating uncertainty and threatening the global recovery. Erdoğan seems to have relaxed his pressure for rate cuts. Earlier today he said debate on the issue had largely dropped off the agenda, and that the government’s goal was to lower inflation to single digits. The Berkshire-based firm, formerly known as Reckitt Benckiser, said it was absorbing some of its increased costs, but was increasing prices of some of its products. “We are passing some pricing on to consumers, but we minimise that through programmes that we have internally such as productivity programmes,” Jeff Carr, chief financial officer at Reckitt, told reporters. Reckitt said it was seeing “across the board” increases in the price of raw materials, especially those related to crude oil such as plastics, as well as tinplate – used for making tin cans – and dairy products. The company has also been facing continued supply chain disruption, and higher transport costs. Back in the markets, gold hit its highest level in eight months this morning as rising inflation and the Ukraine crisis boosted demand. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at ThinkMarkets, says three factors have pushed up gold: heightened geopolitical risks and stock market volatility falling real yields, and soaring inflation. Gold dropped on Tuesday when Russia claimed it was withdrawing some troops, but has now jumped to its highest since last June. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, also attributes gold’s rise to the Ukraine crisis: Industry body ACEA reported that ongoing semiconductor shortages are still damaging car sales across the region, with factories forced to cut production.  The financial services platform, which helps consumers compare deals, said revenue from its travel insurance comparisons had bounced back in the last three months of 2021. However, it said high wholesale energy prices meant there had been no switchable tariffs available to consumers since October. As a result, the London-listed company said it would not make any profit this year from customers using their platform to compare deals from energy providers, although it predicted the tariff-switching market would return in the medium term.  It’s the fifth consecutive week of increasing retail footfall, driven by weekly rises in high street footfall as Covid-19 cases dropped from their record highs. The most frequently reported reasons continued to be: Many of the cheaper grocery items have seen the steepest increases, which is hurting the poorest families. My colleague Zoe Wood reported yesterday that the Canterbury and District food bank has seen a surge in demand from struggling households, and falling donations as supporters are also squeezed - just as food prices jump. Motorists have also been paying more at the pumps, with petrol and diesel prices hitting records this month.

Video: Oireachtas TVProf Paul Moynagh: ‘If we don’t lift mask restrictions now, when will we lift them?’ Photograph: iStockMinister for the Environment Eamon Ryan has said the requirement for children to wear face masks in schools should be removed immediately and he hopes it can be done “straight away”.Mr Ryan said masks should also no longer be mandatory in retail and public transport settings, but instead included in public guidance.It comes as the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) meets with a discussion to whether to relax rules on face masks on the agenda.Face masks must currently be worn on public transport and in shops by law and there are fines for breaches of this requirement. In schools, wearing masks remains as advice for those from third class up, even after the requirement to do so in many other settings has fallen away.“My view, which I’m happy to share publicly, is that we should start immediately by removing the requirement for our school children have to wear masks in school,” Mr Ryan said.“It was put in for good reasons, for good public health reasons but I think there are also good reasons for the health of our children in the wider context of them not having to wear masks and I hope that can be done straight away.Mr Ryan said he had listened to concerns from teachers’ and public transport unions and that he believed the vast majority of people would continue to wear masks in the short term adding “I don’t believe we should continue it as a mandatory system”.Mr Ryan was responding to Labour leader Alan Kelly during Leaders’ Questions in the Dáil on Thursday who said many transport and retail unions had concerns about face masks no longer being required.He said there was a lot of anxiety for staff and people who are vulnerable and those considering using public transport.The general secretary of the National Bus and Rail Union, Dermot O’Leary, said his members were concerned there could be conflict between passengers over the wearing of masks.The managing director of Retail Excellence Ireland, Duncan Graham, said it was time for people to make up their own mind on wearing masks.Compliance from retail workers and shoppers had been exceptional, he said, but the mandate had taken away from the enjoyable experience of shoppers.‘Different stage’Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said he will continue to wear a face mask in shops and on public transport even if rules are eased.“I will continue to wear masks, going into retail, and if I’m on public transport, and will continue to do that as a as a precaution,” Mr Martin said in Brussels on Thursday ahead of a summit of European Union and African leaders.He noted there was a difference between legally mandated rules and public health advice or guidance.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan in a recent meeting had been “pleased in terms of the current trajectory of the disease” in a recent meeting, the Taoiseach said.“The pandemic isn’t over. But we are in a different phase of the pandemic,” he said.Going forward, the focus would be on vaccination, and those who have not been vaccinated or received a booster because they caught Covid-19 should come forward to receive jabs, he said.“There’s absolutely no question that the vaccine was critical, and the booster was critical, to preventing a lot of people from ending up in hospital or an intensive care or from getting very sick,” the Taoiseach said.Public health adviceMinister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris has said that wearing masks will be removed “the moment” it is advised they are no longer required. Speaking in Dublin on Thursday, Mr Harris said the reason people are wearing masks is not based on political decisions but due to public health advice.“The moment the National Public Health Emergency Team believes that not to be required any longer, is the moment Government will act,” he said. “I expect they’ll communicate their advice to the Government later today, and then the Government will act swiftly in relation to that advice.”He said the overall context was a positive trajectory for the virus both in Ireland and elsewhere, and that “restrictions and requirements should only remain in place for the time they’re required from a public health point of view”.Asked about the future of Nphet, he said he believed it was a fact that it was likely to play “a less active role” in the future.Level of immunityIt is time to lift the mandate to wear masks, an immunologist has said, as “now is as good as it’s going to get” with regard to cases of Omicron.Prof Paul Moynagh said there was now a level of immunity to Covid-19 in the population because of vaccination and asked: “If we don’t lift mask restrictions now, when will we lift them?”Prof Moynagh said on Thursday morning that masks had a benefit, but the Omicron variant was difficult to control. He said the variant was less severe than previous versions of the virus and the high case numbers were not translating into high hospital numbers or severe illness.He said he hoped there would not be conflict in workplaces between colleagues who had differing opinions on mask wearing in the workplace.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"half of vaccinated people yet to receive booster intend to get one soon says poll","story":"Some 8 per cent say they would not get a booster if offered one next week.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA Schools, colleges, and early education services in seven counties will close on Friday due to a “multi-hazard” weather event during Storm Eunice, the Government’s crisis management team has said.The National Emergency Co-Ordination Group met on Thursday in preparation for the arrival of the storm system, which is forecast to bring damaging winds, sleet, rain and “blizzard-like” conditions from the early hours of Friday morning.A status-red wind warning has been issued for Cork and Kerry, while status orange weather warnings will be in effect for 18 other countries.Following the meeting, the team announced schools and colleges in counties with red wind warnings and orange snow warnings - Cork, Kerry, Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal and Roscommon - will be closed for the full day on Friday.However, a statement from the Department of Education said remote teaching and learning should commence “where possible”.Schools in the orange zone are affected due to what has been described as a “multi-hazard” event, with a combined danger from high winds and snow.The blanket closure does not apply to schools in counties with a status- orange wind warning, which are permitted to open, subject to local conditions.Bus Éireann and other transport links, such as Local Link, will not operate while the status-red warning is in place in Cork and Kerry, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has said.Irish Rail will operate during the red warning, but the NTA advised that there could be delays and cancellations as a result of damage or flooding.Elsewhere around the country, public transport will continue to operate, subject to local weather conditions.‘High impact’ Speaking at a media briefing on Thursday, Keith Leonard, director of emergency management at the Department of Housing, said the storm will be a “high impact, multi-hazard” event.“It will track quickly across the country, causing significant disruption with power outages and trees down in many areas,” he added.People in these counties are advised to stay indoors, due to the potential threat to life, debris and the risk of hazardous driving conditions.A 12-hour status orange snow warning will come into effect at 3am for Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo and Roscommon, with heavy sleet and snow leading to “blizzard-like conditions” in parts.A separate status orange wind warning has been put in place for Carlow, Clare, Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Limerick, Offaly, Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow from 3am until 11am on Friday.A status-yellow wind, rain and snow warning will be in place for the rest of the country, from 1am until 3pm.Evelyn Cusack, head of forecasting at Met Éireann, said the impact of the storm will be first felt just after midnight. “There is possibly snow in all areas for a short time, but particularly heavy in the northwest, combined with likely gale force winds. It will be very variable from place to place,” she said.Powerful storm“It’s going to be a powerful storm zipping across Ireland, giving very strong winds absolutely everywhere.

She added that safety is of “critical importance” and members of the public should stay away from overhead powerlines that have fallen down.The local government sector said it is prepared and ready to respond to the weather event, with each local authority having sufficient salt to grit roads. The civil defence is also on standby to assist, should the need arise.The Road Safety Authority has called on those in red-warning areas to avoid all travel, those in orange-warning counties to consider postponing their journeys until the storm has abated and those in yellow-areas to take significant caution while travelling.In Northern Ireland, the UK Met Office issued a a status-yellow snow warning for Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Derry from 3am until 6pm on Friday, and a yellow wind warning for Antrim, Down and Derry from 7am until 6pm on Friday.A status red marine warning is also in place off the coast of the south of Ireland, with winds forecast to reach storm force 10 or violent storm force 11.The storm is the second to hit the country this week, after storm Dudley brought strong winds of up to 100 kmh on Wednesday.

No time and date has been set for the next meeting. One source at the meeting said the impression they got was: “We’re done.” A move to a more normalised approach, out of the emergency stance that gave rise to Nphet, is now seen as highly likely by multiple sources. But the final decision rests with Mr Donnelly.The meeting also agreed a radical shake up to testing and masking in the country.

The great French mathematician Henri Poincaré, a brilliant expositor of the scientific method, described how he grappled for months with an arcane problem in function theory. Exasperated by lack of progress, he went on holidays and forgot about the problem. But, as he was boarding a bus, the answer came to him in a flash. He was later able to return to his office and complete a proof of the result.This is characteristic of the sudden spurts of progress that often occur. New mathematical ideas do not arise according to some pre-determined plan they seem to pop up in random fashion, but this invariably happens following sustained efforts and deep thought, which lay the groundwork for discovery.Some mathematicians keep regular and limited working hours. The renowned English mathematician GH Hardy began his research after breakfast each day, working until 1pm. Then he would have lunch and head for the cricket ground. But, of course, progress was not confined to the four morning hours. The intense conscious mental effort triggered unconscious activity, with sudden insights breaking through at any time, day or night.Where do the ideas come from?Ideas come from a multitude of sources, but the researcher needs time to think about them, follow up hunches and explore various options. No holds are barred at this stage and intuition is given free rein. A mathematician may have a feeling that a certain result is valid but cannot prove it. Intuition is a valuable guide, but it can also mislead us to believe what appears obvious but is false. For this reason, mathematicians insist on a cast-iron proof, understandable to their colleagues and removing all doubt. A result does not become a theorem until the conditions for its validity are established and it is shown to follow logically from these conditions. In the past, most research was done by mathematicians working alone. They might maintain contact with colleagues and attend meetings and conferences, but published papers usually had a single author. This is no longer the case: today, most papers have two or more authors and collaborative work is the norm. Where does it all happen?The conventional notion is that research is carried out at an office desk or in a library. A mathematical idea may arise at a meeting, a seminar, or a conference. There are also research centres dedicated to mathematics: INI in Cambridge, IHP in Paris, MFO in Oberwolfach, IMA in Minnesota and many more, where mathematicians gather for a week or two to work together.Walking provides a great opportunity for thinking and many researchers have written about how their best ideas came to them during a ramble. René Descartes did his mathematical thinking while still in bed in the morning. The Indian genius Srinivasa Ramanujan was inspired by Mahalakshmi of Namakkal, a family Goddess when, as he slept, complex mathematical results unfolded before his eyes. American topologist Stephen Smale used to do his research on the beach in Rio de Janeiro, and André Weil proved one of his most famous results, the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields, while in prison. Other likely places for inspiration are on a train or plane, in a café or church, at a concert or in dreamland.

Photograph: Peter ParksAFP via Getty ImagesThe scenes were straight out of China’s coronavirus playbook. Armies of workers, deployed to lock down residents. Plans to erect a massive makeshift hospital. And on Wednesday, a command from Xi Jinping, the country’s top leader, plastered across local front pages: “Make controlling the epidemic as soon as possible an overwhelming priority.”The site of the latest outbreak, though, was not mainland China, but neighbouring Hong Kong. And unlike on the mainland, where the government’s lofty language has been followed by quick results, no such relief is in sight.As Hong Kong sinks under its worst wave yet of coronavirus, overwhelmed hospitals have left patients waiting on pavements. People have stood in testing lines that wind across parks and soccer fields. Cases are still growing exponentially, as officials opt for targeted lockdowns rather than a citywide one.Researchers have warned that by summer the latest wave could kill nearly 1,000 people – more than four times the number that have died of Covid in Hong Kong over the past two years.The city’s flailing response has exposed a crucial weakness in its ability to handle coronavirus. Unlike other places facing a surge of the Omicron variant, Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese city, cannot choose to live with the virus Beijing continues to demand local elimination. But the city, which retains certain freedoms unheard-of in the mainland, also cannot wield Beijing’s full authoritarian tool kit or nearly unlimited manpower to stamp out transmission at any cost.‘Dynamic zero’Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has struggled even to define the term that the government uses to describe its approach, “dynamic zero”. “‘Dynamic zero’ – I admit this is a policy requirement of the mainland,” she told reporters last month. “But I am not the initiator, so if you want an authoritative definition of ‘dynamic’, I’m sorry, I really can’t explain it.”At its core, the city’s crisis reflects the limitations of its unique political model. Health experts have pointed out that certain measures, such as citywide mandatory testing, would be impractical in Hong Kong, and could also stir anger in a public already deeply distrustful of the government.But as Beijing exerts ever-tighter control over Hong Kong, through a national security law and sweeping crackdown on dissent, those considerations may start to carry less weight.Some have called Hong Kong’s willingness to embrace tougher restrictions a proxy for its loyalty to Beijing. “The loopholes and oscillation in Hong Kong’s antivirus strategy show that some officials have not met the requirements for ‘firm patriotism’, said Tian Feilong, a law professor at Beijing’s Beihang University who studies Hong Kong.Last month, the Hong Kong government was forced to clarify that it was legal to make “general remarks and discussion” about the effectiveness of dynamic zero, after Junius Ho, a pro-Beijing lawmaker, suggested that questioning it could violate the security law.Meanwhile, the public health toll continues to grow. Some 12,000 people who have tested positive are still waiting to be admitted to a hospital or isolation unit, according to government figures. After five months with no Covid deaths, Hong Kong has recorded at least 21 over the past week, including a 3-year-old girl and a 100-year-old woman on Tuesday.Early successesUntil this wave, Hong Kong kept coronavirus largely in check. The city’s combination of tight social distancing rules and aggressive contact tracing meant that the previous four waves of infection were curbed relatively quickly. For much of 2021, the city recorded no local cases. But the highly transmissible Omicron variant assaulted the cracks in the city’s defences.The first local Omicron transmissions were traced to two flight attendants who returned from abroad in December. A bigger Omicron cluster was connected to a woman who was infected while in hotel quarantine after returning from Pakistan. The woman passed the virus to her husband, who spread it to a cleaner at a vast housing development.Hong Kong locked down a half-dozen buildings and tested 37,000 people last month after more than 100 people there tested positive. The virus has now spread to more than 20 senior homes and care facilities, highlighting another weakness in Hong Kong’s preparations. While more than 84 per cent of people over age 11 have had at least one shot of a vaccine, among those 70 and older, the proportion is just 56 per cent.“In a way we were a victim of our own success because the fatality rate and the infection rate were pretty good until recently,” said Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker who was speaking by phone from self-quarantine after her driver tested positive. “Older people thought they didn’t need to be vaccinated because there could be complications. And the government was hesitant. We have avoided vaccine mandates.”As the outbreak grew, Lam at first tried to draw a clear line between Hong Kong and the mainland, even as she pledged to adhere to dynamic zero. It would be impractical to invite mainland workers to carry out door-to-door testing, she said this month, in part because of language differences the primary language in Hong Kong is Cantonese, not the Mandarin used in the mainland. Lam also rejected calls from pro-Beijing lawmakers to introduce mandatory universal testing, defending the more targeted operations.“If we give up this effective, focused testing work and rashly follow other places to conduct so-called community testing, I will not bear the consequences,” she said. “Anti-epidemic work is not a slogan.”“The Hong Kong government just follows instructions from Beijing, but they are still hesitant to go full throttle, to go all the way,” said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor of politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “They know that most people in Hong Kong don’t trust the Chinese way of doing things.”Political pressureBut in recent weeks, as the outbreak has spiralled out of control, calls for Hong Kong to draw closer to the mainland strategy have grown. China’s state news agency and official Communist Party mouthpiece both published commentaries this month warning against any suggestion of living with the virus.The political pressure, coupled with the deteriorating public health situation, seems to have had an effect. Over the weekend, Hong Kong officials travelled to Shenzhen, across the border, to set up joint task forces with officials there. The task forces will work to increase testing capacity and build makeshift isolation facilities, like the ones used in China, the government said.On Wednesday, Beijing announced that it would also assign central government officials, in addition to the regional ones, to help oversee Hong Kong’s outbreak. But even pro-Beijing figures acknowledge that Hong Kong cannot copy the mainland model outright.When authorities this month locked down Baise, a city of about 3.6 million in southwestern China, after a flare-up of several dozen cases, they deployed 38,000 Communist Party members and workers to patrol neighbourhoods and coordinate supplies, according to the local government. Such networks are a longstanding part of the mainland’s social controls. Hong Kong has more than twice as many residents and no such network.“We lack enough organisation, mobilisation and control capabilities, and we also lack a strong government,” said Lau Siu-Kai, an adviser to Beijing in Hong Kong.Hong Kongers could also prove fiercely resistant to a citywide lockdown. When Lam visited a locked-down housing estate last month, residents showered her with insults from their windows – a display of public dissent rarely seen since the imposition of the security law.The government has hesitated to introduce more invasive contact tracing apps such as exist in the mainland, in part because of residents’ privacy concerns. But some worry that authorities will use the latest outbreak as an opportunity to push through more surveillance measures, Willy Lam, the professor, said. Trust in the Hong Kong and Beijing governments “is quite low”, he said.Health experts say the political debate has overshadowed the grim medical reality. Between low vaccination rates among older people and the slowness to impose lockdowns, the situation is unlikely to improve any time soon, no matter what path Hong Kong adopts, said Siddharth Sridhar, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong.“Hong Kong is moving too late,” he said. “We don’t have any good options.” – This article originally appeared in The New York TimesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"kyiv and moscow blame each other for clashes in donbas region","story":"US secretary of defence Lloyd Austin has dismissed Russian claims that Moscow has withdrawn troops from the Ukrainian border, saying that US intelligence has seen Russia stocking up on blood supplies and flying more combat aircraft into the region.Ukrainian soldiers at a frontline position near Katerynivka, in eastern Ukraine, on Wednesday. Photograph: Tyler HicksNew York Times Kyiv and Moscow blamed each other for clashes in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region on Thursday as Western officials continued to question Russia’s claims it had withdrawn troops from close to the country’s border.The Ukrainian army said “Russian occupation forces” controlling breakaway far-eastern regions of Ukraine had “with special cynicism” shelled a kindergarten in a village in the Luhansk region, injuring two civilians. It later said shelling was occurring in more than 20 separate locations as unconfirmed videos including the sound of live fire appeared on social media.Russia – which backs separatists in the Donbas but denies, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that it is a party to the conflict – blamed Ukraine for the escalation. Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for president Vladimir Putin, said the shelling “was a subject of very, very deep concern”.“We have warned many times that Ukraine’s excessive concentration of its armed forces next to the line of contact, along with the possibility of provocations, could be highly dangerous. And now we can see these provocations are happening,” Mr Peskov told reporters.The flare-up was the latest in a smouldering conflict that has claimed about 14,000 lives in the breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk since erupting in 2014 after Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula.A statement posted on the website of Donetsk-based Russia-backed separatists said: “The situation on the line of contact has escalated significantly over the past few hours.”US president Joe Biden has said his “sense” is that Russia will invade Ukraine within the next several days.Speaking to reporters as he left the White House for a visit to Cleveland, he said the prospect of a Russian attack on Ukraine was “very high”. He maintained that Russia could engage in a “false flag” operation as an excuse to “go in” to Ukraine.Asked if he believed a diplomatic resolution was still possible, Mr Biden said: “Yes.” He said he had no plans to call the Russian leader Vladimir Putin and he had not yet seen a response by Russia to security proposals made by the US. The increased fighting in Donbas comes as the United States, UK and Nato continued to rebut Russia’s claims this week that it was pulling back some of its forces from the border with Ukraine and in Crimea as well as Donbas.The White House late on Wednesday called the Kremlin’s claims that it is withdrawing forces from the Ukrainian border “false” and accused Russia of increasing its troop presence in the region by about 7,000 in recent days.The Thursday flare-up has also raised fears that Mr Putin – who has massed more than 150,000 troops around Ukraine and warned this week that Kyiv was conducting a “genocide” in Donbas – could use it as a pretext to invade the country. The US and UK have repeatedly warned that Moscow could orchestrate such a “false-flag” operation to justify a deeper incursion.“Russia’s claim of genocide in Ukraine is a reprehensible falsehood,” the US mission to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said in an overnight tweet.The OSCE’s special monitoring mission in Ukraine “has complete access to the government-controlled areas of Ukraine and has never reported anything remotely resembling Russia’s claims”, the mission added. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022Stay on top of the latest

has had a transformative effect on Cornwall, bringing worldwide attention, jobs and a much-needed economic boost.But no good turn goes unpunished, it seems, particularly in a county where outsiders like Dutch-born Sir Tim are insultingly labelled “grockles” by some natives.For 20 years, Sir Tim has bitten his tongue as critics have railed against change, but he has finally let rip with an extraordinary takedown of locals who obsess about their “mums’ pasties” and romanticise “good old days” that never existed.In an expletive-laden rant, Sir Tim, who grew up in Sussex, accused Cornish people of defining their lives “in terms of what you don’t like” and of attacking entrepreneurs like Rick Stein who had helped rejuvenate their county.He told The Reason Why podcast: “One of the problems in Cornwall is, if you say anything – if you’re not Cornish – and you say anything about it, they say you’re an arrogant so-and-so speaking for the Cornish.“You feel, and I don’t, but you feel like saying ‘well if you were a bit more f- - -ing articulate you could speak up for yourself but you haven’t’.“You’ve all got mums who made the best pasties in the world and it’s fantastic and it’s fabulous, and you talk about the good old days, and the good old days never were the good old days.“They’ve been bad for about 70 years – and they’ve been bad because of t- - - - - s like you.”Sir Tim, 67, opened the Eden Project in 2000 after transforming an old clay pit near St Austell into a unique world of interlinking domes housing exotic plants from around the world. It attracts more than a million visitors each year and is reported to have contributed more than £1billion to the Cornish economy.Not everyone has welcomed the influx of visitors and cash, but Sir Tim said it was time they came up with their own ideas for taking the county forward rather than simply directing anger at those who are doing it for them.“His foundation was the fishermen of Padstow and him being a chef of fish.“He is personally quite anxious about being seen as a spokesman for Cornwall because he knows you get bricks thrown at you for saying you speak for anybody here.”Malcolm Bell, chief executive of the tourism body Visit Cornwall, said: “I suppose my reaction is I am a bit offended. The Cornish people are wonderfully warm and welcoming. It is regrettable because we are a community, we are a proud community. We know there are some strong views that most of us maybe don’t agree with and it does polarise people.“My view very simply is if you can’t say anything nice, don’t say anything at all.”On Wednesday, Sir Tim apologised for the comments. In a statement, he said: “I’m sorry that some of the comments I made in the podcast have caused offence. “I hope that when people listen to the whole piece they will realise that I was speaking in the context of defending my friend Rick Stein and my strongest words were directed at people who seek to damn him for making Cornwall attractive to outsiders.“I wasn’t intending to comment on Cornish people as a whole, rather some of those who would tell you that the past was better than now when the truth is different it was not.“Cornwall has been my home for more than 30 years and I don’t want  a few harsh words on my part to damage the many friendships I’ve made in a place I love.  “My comments in the round are extremely pro-Cornwall and the rightness of anger at the neglect of this special place  - and an encouragement not to attack the wrong targets.”The podcast was hosted by Cornish actor and musician Seamus Carer, who said: “I’ve tried to make a balanced, nuanced piece of journalism about Cornwall, from the point of view of someone who grew up and still lives here. With that in mind, I’m extremely grateful to Tim for giving me his time and opinions.“I’m a big fan of empathy, so can see where Tim’s coming from whilst also understanding the anger that some listeners have voiced. It’s good to remember that Tim’s made big things happen in Cornwall, which many people have benefited from. He’s a canny businessman, with a confident style. He’s always been very supportive of my work and is a family friend.“However, I’m aware that some people feel distrust and animosity towards him, hence why he was such an important figure to interview. The overall aim of the podcast was to look at issues in contemporary Cornwall and to try to understand both sides of the argument. There’s no simple answer to any of it, but having dialogue and listening is certainly a good start. That’s all I tried to do.”More from NewsPolitics latest news: Britain should never seek \u0026#39special relationship\u0026#39 with EU, says Lord FrostEmmanuel Macron denies French withdrawal from Mali \u0026#39a failure\u0026#39Russia-Ukraine crisis: Invasion in \u0026#39next several days\u0026#39, says Joe BidenStorm Eunice could produce \u0026#39sting jet\u0026#39 like 1987 Great Storm ‘Look at the screen’, GP told blind patientMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hms queen elizabeth inside aircraft carrier royal navy flagship","story":"The yellow-helmeted flight deck officer leans into a 40-knot wind and raises a small green flag in his right hand. I crouch behind him, clutching my robust but battered high-def camera. A few feet away, a snarling F-35B Lightning Stealth Fighter, sleek as a shark and every bit as lethal, prepares to launch into the steel-grey skies of the eastern Mediterranean.On the bridge, the navigators steer directly into the wind. ‘Steady on designated flying course, one-one-zero,’ says the officer of the watch.  ‘Steady on one-one-zero, sir,’ confirms the helmsman.The F-35B needs plenty of headwind to get airborne. The aircraft has a run-up of only 350 feet to the curved ‘ski-jump’, from which it will make its final leap skywards. Inside the glass-encased flight control tower behind us, the vessel’s Commander Air, Ed Phillips, aka ‘Wings’, looks up and down the massive flight deck and, when satisfied all is clear, gives a short sharp order:All eyes turn to the green flag held aloft and rippling in the wind. Probably worth no more than a couple of quid, it is brought down to the ground with a dramatic flourish the signal for the F-35B, worth well over £100 million, to get airborne.I brace myself for the immense power about to be unleashed. I’ve witnessed this many times and know what to expect. It’ll be exhilarating, for sure, but also terrifying and probably painful. I’m determined to capture on film a spectacular close-up of a launch as near to the aircraft as possible, but the timing is critical and so far I’ve manifestly failed to pull it off.The searing blast from the rear jet nozzle has always blown me off my feet and sent me sprawling. I have the bruises and cuts to show for it and God knows how much skin I’ve now invested in the roughened, diamond-hard surface of the flight deck. But I still don’t have the footage I want. This time, two hefty sailors are ready to hold me down, or at least try to. My fear is that no amount of muscle power will be a match for the explosive thrust of what is essentially a horizontal rocket.The pilot releases the brakes and opens the throttle. The Pratt \u0026amp Whitney afterburning, turbofan engine raises its pitch to a terrifying scream as the aircraft surges forward. I clench my teeth, tense my muscles and, with my heart pounding in my ears, bear hug the camera in a semi-stable position. But how long can I hold on? Four vice-like hands press down on my hunched shoulders.It’s June 2021 and I’ve joined the ship’s company of HMS Queen Elizabeth for her first operational deployment. We are some weeks into a seven-month voyage to the South China Sea, not on exercise but, locked, loaded and ready for action, should it become necessary.The new carrier and fleet flagship, together with eight escorts (destroyers, frigates, supply ships and a submarine) comprise Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21) – the most powerful naval force to leave the UK in a generation. Prior to our transit through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, on our way to the Pacific and the disputed waters of the South China Sea, the ship has been launching waves of jets on Operation Shader – in support of land forces in the fight against Islamic State in Syria. But this has prompted a reaction from the Russians. They consider this part of the Med their own backyard and are intent on letting the QE and her escorts know they’re not welcome here. But the QE is the new dog on the block and she’s here to mark her own territory, not with a wag of the tail but a snarl.Today’s launch of the F-35s, therefore, is not to attack IS but to ward off Russian warplanes attempting to overfly us. Pilots, drawn from the Fleet Air Arm, RAF and US Marine Corps, have been scrambling all day, sometimes in rapid two-minute intervals, to intercept ‘red bandits’ and escort them away at a safe range.The Russians, apart from wanting to goad the Royal Navy, are desperate to get a closer look at the QE, the most advanced aircraft carrier in the world, and also test the Task Group’s reaction procedures – not only in the air but also on the surface, with their warships, and underwater with their submarines. The QE’s Anti-Submarine Warfare Merlin Mk2 helicopters from 820 Naval Air Squadron are on constant patrol in order to monitor subsurface incursions and react accordingly. Nobody has actually opened fire, but there’s a lot of posturing and tactical lip-curling. If this is the start of a new Cold War, nobody is in doubt that things could heat up very quickly. The QE’s magazines are bursting with bombs, bullets and missiles of all descriptions and capabilities, as you’d expect on a warship that is now Britain’s main conventional strategic deterrent.Commodore Steve Moorhouse, leading CSG21, knows that Britain’s potential adversaries, the Russians and Chinese, will prod and poke his Task Group at every opportunity. ‘They want to see what we’re made of,’ he freely admits. ‘And I’m happy to show them, but professionally, in a spirit of confidence, not confrontation.’ Moorhouse is a steely commander but also a diplomat by default. After all, HMS Queen Elizabeth, a chunk of British sovereign territory, is part warship, part floating embassy. As the embodiment of ‘Global Britain’, her charge is to deliver ‘power projection’ on behalf of the nation: on the one hand that means hard-edged, lethal warfare on the other it’s about soft, political persuasion through deterrence, as well as overt support for allies around the world.Friends and foes alike will be watching this deployment with keen interest and I’m here to capture it on film for a forthcoming BBC TV series. But this isn’t the first time I’ve filmed HMS Queen Elizabeth. That was back in 2009, when I witnessed Princess Anne cutting the ship’s first steel at Govan shipyard in Glasgow. This was not so much the birth of Britain’s biggest-ever warship – more like her conception – and I was struck by the enormity of the occasion.  Sir Jonathon Band, the First Sea Lord at the time, spoke with passion to the audience and assembled media. The Queen Elizabeth Class of aircraft carrier, comprising HMS Queen Elizabeth, with HMS Prince of Wales to follow, would, he explained, ‘provide Britain with the means to deliver air power from the sea, wherever and whenever required, and in a stronger and more decisive form than ever before’. They will also, he added, ‘be the centrepiece of Britain’s military capability for many years to come’.The construction of HMS Queen Elizabeth and her sister ship meant a complete reinvention of the Royal Navy but, despite Sir Jonathon’s upbeat messaging, it was to prove a painful and long-drawn-out process. Our active carriers at the time, Ark Royal, Illustrious and Invincible, were about to be axed in the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review and with them the Navy’s Harrier squadron – its entire naval fixed-wing capability. Already, naysayers and vocal critics were provoking a heated debate over the pros and cons of a carrier-centric Navy, and whether there’d be enough escort ships to protect the carriers while at sea or sufficient sailors to man them – each would be three times the size of the Invincible Class carriers.General Sir Peter Wall, former head of the British Army, described the decision to build the new carriers as no more than a ‘vanity project’ that ‘lacked credibility’ and which could be seen to have ‘skewed the UK’s conventional defence effort to a damaging degree’. Max Hastings, ever the provocateur, suggested the new warships represented delusions of grandeur for a Navy in decline. Other denigrators were quick to point out that a large carrier is a big target – especially for the new generation of hypersonic missiles that the Chinese call ‘carrier killers’.Russia inevitably chimed in with some of its own political trash talk: ‘Just make sure you keep your new carrier away from Moscow’s warships or they’ll send it to the bottom of the sea.’Military hardware is an emotive subject, especially in the context of huge capital expenditure that might otherwise be spent on housing, welfare or the NHS, but £6 billion for two vessels (albeit a near doubling of the original budget) is modest compared to the eye-watering price tag of USS Gerald R. Ford, an American super-carrier of similar proportions which cost more than $13 billion (and which, according to the Pentagon, ‘has yet to demonstrate it can effectively defend itself from anti-ship missiles and other threats’).The glossy brochure issued by a conglomerate of shipbuilders known as the Aircraft Carrier Alliance certainly suggested that Britain was getting its money’s worth. At 65,000 tonnes, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales would not only be the biggest warships ever built for the Royal Navy, but also the most powerful and advanced in terms of military technology and stealth capabilities – especially when married eventually to the state-of-the-art F-35B Lightning jet fighter.The sales pitch for the super-carriers came with a staggering array of facts and figures. The ships, it claimed, would be so highly automated they’d require only ‘lean-manned’ crews – less than 1,000 per ship, without aircrew. That’s broadly one fifth the size of an American crew on a similar-sized ship. They’d each have a four-acre flight deck, the size of three and a half football fields, nine decks and a hangar big enough to fit two Type 23 frigates side by side. Each carrier would have two propellers weighing 33 tonnes – exerting the same thrust as 50 high-speed trains and producing a maximum speed in excess of 27 knots (31mph). The six engines (two mighty gas turbines and four diesels) would produce enough energy to power a city the size of Swindon the electrical cabling and wiring would stretch six times round the world the ship, weighing the same as 35,000 family cars, would carry enough fuel to take those cars to the moon and back a dozen times… and on it went.The statistics were mind-boggling, but one thing was for sure: the challenge of building the first of these ships – the nine-decked HMS Queen Elizabeth – manning her, taking her to sea and getting her battle-ready was going to be a compelling story, as I learnt while following her construction in seven shipyards around the UK, culminating in her final assembly at Rosyth in Fife, like some gargantuan Lego toy. But, engineering aside, I knew that her real story would reside in the sailors yet to arrive the men and women who would breathe life into the country’s first super-carrier.  Foremost among them was Jerry Kyd, the ship’s first seagoing captain. I encountered him on the day he arrived in Rosyth in May 2016, as he addressed a fledgling ship’s company of just 456 sailors standing in front of their ship, still an inert hulk without propellers and dead in the water.‘The world’s a frisky place at the moment,’ he said. ‘And we have to be ready to respond to threats which I think are coming sooner rather than later.’ Kyd glanced towards their future home, encased in scaffolding. ‘HMS Queen Elizabeth, as big and sophisticated as she might be, is really just a huge metal box, full of pipes, wires, gadgetry and computer terminals. She’s missing one vital ingredient…’ He paused dramatically. ‘Without the flesh, blood, muscle and hearts of you, my sailors, that ship is just a robot. You, not the ship, are the most important resource at my disposal.’It was nearly a year before the QE was ready for her first sea trials. As a ‘new build’, there were bound to be problems. On the eve of our departure for the North Sea, Captain Kyd warned that there would be emergencies: ‘We’ll have floods, we’ll have fires. And casualties too. That’s the nature of this business.’For the best part of two months the ship was put through her paces off the coast of Scotland, where I joined them. The first aircraft, a Merlin helicopter, was landed on the flight deck within four days as the ship’s company got used to their largely subterranean existence deep in the belly of the beast. I watched with amazement as the sailors, many of them straight out of training, transformed the massive grey hulk not only into a working warship but a home from home. The QE was fast becoming a vibrant floating city and, with 23 nations represented from across the Commonwealth, all human life was here. My first challenge, however, was to learn my way round a ship longer than the Houses of Parliament and taller than Nelson’s Column and so gigantic that it boasted five kilometres of passageways and 3,200 compartments.Apart from a serious issue with a cracked thrust block that held one of the drive shafts in place, all went as well as could be expected. As Jerry Kyd foretold, there were plenty of fires and floods as the ship was pushed to breaking point so that her technical and seagoing limits could be identified. There were ‘casualties’ too, but thankfully only minor ones – the worst being cracked teeth and broken fingers. Sea trials completed, we finally entered Portsmouth dockyard, the ship’s designated home port, and within months the QE was officially commissioned by the Queen.After a period of maintenance, the ship set off for the next vital stage of her trials off the eastern seaboard of the US. Within hours of leaving Portsmouth we became aware of an ominous presence – a Russian Federation frigate called Admiral Makarov had closed to within two miles of our position. A highly capable warship armed with Kalibr long-range cruise missiles, the Makarov was in transit from the Baltic to Sevastopol on the Black Sea. While officially permitted to route through the English Channel she had clearly erted her course to have a closer look at our ship.  A few days later, just before starting our transatlantic crossing, we were suddenly erted into the Irish Sea to help chase off a Russian submarine spotted in British territorial waters. There was an increasing concern, as there still is, that Russians could be sussing out British underwater power and communication cabling – an obvious target for a potential enemy.  The Russian sub made a run for it as soon as we got close. Even before the QE had become operational the writing was on the wall and it was written very clearly in Cyrillic script. A sign of things to come (and indeed I write this as the world tries to second-guess Russian designs on Ukraine).Following this brief ersion we progressed across the Atlantic and the next dramatic event I witnessed was the ship’s first-ever run ashore in a foreign port, which didn’t go entirely to plan. In Mayport, Florida, after a night of heavy drinking, four sailors from the QE and two from our escort frigate, HMS Monmouth, were arrested for a range of alcohol-related offences including jaywalking, fighting and resisting arrest. Despite making headlines on both sides of the Atlantic, the episode was soon forgotten and at least part of the blame was attached to overzealous policing.  Captain Kyd, a pragmatist, reckoned that a night in jail was punishment enough for sailors letting off steam. ‘The question we have to ask ourselves,’ Kyd told his commanders, ‘is what sort of sailor would we want to go to war with? The automaton who obeys every rule, plays it safe and never takes chances? Or the free spirit who pushes his luck and breaks the odd rule?’    Kyd quickly refocused on the job in hand – namely to see an F-35B Lightning jet land on the ship’s flight deck for the first time. Helicopters were one thing, but a fighter jet that lands vertically using immense downward thrust from its enormous engine was quite another. Commander Nathan Gray, the Navy’s top test pilot, was the first to attempt a landing. It went without a hitch, although many questions remained about safety margins before the flight deck and aircraft could be handed over to front-line combat pilots. Two months of continuous, painstaking testing in all weathers, including a full-blown hurricane, gradually provided the answers. Gray, despite a few near misses, was satisfied that he and his colleagues had done all they could to ready the ship and aircraft for action.  And so to the present. Here I am aboard the QE once again – no longer on sea trials, but busy arm-wrestling the Russians, and before long she’ll be playing cat-and-mouse with the Chinese in the South China Sea. This is the acid test, with much at stake. The Prime Minister has declared he wants the Royal Navy to be the most powerful and influential in Europe by the end of the decade. CSG21 is the first step to achieving that ambition and proving that the new aircraft carrier is no white elephant but an effective instrument of government as well as an iconic symbol of nation.  Great adventure beckons and, once again, all life is here – a much expanded ship’s company of 1,650 men and women. Yes, there are the aviators yes, there are the seafarers yes, there are the marine engineers. But there are so many others: stewards, chefs, medics, gunners, aircraft handlers, writers, warfare specialists, physical trainers and intelligence officers. There is even a specialist chocolatier and, maybe because of him, a dedicated dentist and dental hygienist.‘Bleeding frozen chips!’ shouts Ronnie Lambert, an Essex boy, born and bred. ‘They want 10 more boxes in the main galley and they’re all at the back of the frickin’ fridge.’‘Well, get in there and pull ’em out,’ laughs fellow storeman Aaron Mackin. ‘It’s yer bleedin’ job.’‘Well, I’m transferring to aviation! Them boys have it easy up there. All sunshine and sea.’    The F-35B, accelerating from a standing start, rattles my bones. The heavyset sailors push down hard on my prone body as I attempt to point the camera in the right direction. The sailors are now lying on top of me – the jet stream strikes and skittles us. I roll across the deck, trying to protect my camera. Did I capture the moment of take off? I will check as soon as I can. Lying on my back I look up to see five British F-35s close in on three Russian MiGs.There will be more Russian warplanes soon. They’ll keep coming, but at least we know one thing: we have chips to go with our fish tonight. Must be a Friday.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Britain should never seek \u0026#39special relationship\u0026#39 with EU, says Lord FrostEmmanuel Macron denies French withdrawal from Mali \u0026#39a failure\u0026#39Russia-Ukraine crisis: Invasion in \u0026#39next several days\u0026#39, says Joe BidenStorm Eunice could produce \u0026#39sting jet\u0026#39 like 1987 Great Storm ‘Look at the screen’, GP told blind patientMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"relocate england scots vote independence says head major defence","story":"The head of a major defence firm has warned his company could relocate to England if Scots were to vote for independence.David Lockwood, the chief executive of Babcock, said its huge fabrication yard at Rosyth could move south within three years if the firm was made to feel unwelcome after a referendum.Unionists said the intervention showed that major employers would desert the country if Nicola Sturgeon delivers on her plan of winning a referendum next year.Mr Lockwood, speaking to The Courier after Boris Johnson visited Rosyth in Fife this week, said Babcock could “manage” the break up of the UK but suggested this could involve relocation.Almost 800 skilled engineers are employed at the site, one of the largest waterside manufacturing and repair facilities in the UK.“I think in reality there will be plenty of warning if the vote were in favour of independence,” Mr Lockwood said.“There would then be a negotiation period and at the end of the negotiation period there would be an implementation period. So I don’t think there is anything that we can’t manage as a company.”He added: “If we had to replicate this in England because we were told we weren’t welcome here – which I think would be a bad mistake for Scotland – but if that were the decision, we can replicate this in three years, and the time window of negotiations is longer than that. It’s not ideal but it is manageable.”SNP figures responded by insisting that Babcock would be welcome in an independent Scotland. However elements within the independence movement, including the Scottish Greens who are in a coalition government with the SNP, have condemned Scottish-based defence firms as “arms dealers who profit from delivering death, destruction and misery”.Ms Sturgeon has insisted she intends to hold a new vote on independence by next year, although there are major doubts over whether she will be able to deliver.However, Mr Lockwood also warned that the ongoing constitutional debate alone was putting firms off investing in Scotland.“I think if you are already here it is manageable,” he said. “But I think it is a slightly different question if you weren’t here, does it affect your decision?“I am aware of people who are … it is a question they ask when they are making a decision where to base themselves.”Douglas Chapman, the SNP MP for Dunfermline and West Fife, said he was “disappointed” with Mr Lockwood’s remarks. “As the local MP I have consistently supported Babcock and the Rosyth workforce,” he said. “They make a very valuable and significant contribution to our economy. “They operate and are welcomed in many independent countries globally. An independent Scotland will be no different.”Stewart McDonald, the SNP defence spokesman, said the firm was “not just welcome, but vital”.He added: “Babcock is not just an important employer, but would play a crucial role in an independent Scotland’s defence capability.”More from NewsPolitics latest news: Britain should never seek \u0026#39special relationship\u0026#39 with EU, says Lord FrostEmmanuel Macron denies French withdrawal from Mali \u0026#39a failure\u0026#39Russia-Ukraine crisis: Invasion in \u0026#39next several days\u0026#39, says Joe BidenStorm Eunice could produce \u0026#39sting jet\u0026#39 like 1987 Great Storm ‘Look at the screen’, GP told blind patientMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"labour party trying just little hard","story":"First we had Keir Starmer, arch Remainer-in-Chief, the man who single-handedly reversed his own party’s commitment to respecting the outcome of the 2016 referendum, dismissing any suggestion that there might be a case for Britain rejoining the EU.Now his deputy, Angela Rayner, has suggested the police could “shoot terrorists and ask questions later”. In an interview carried on Matt Forde’s excellent political podcast, she channels her inner Tony Blair by coming down heavily on the side of ordinary people against thugs, advocating a radical harassment approach by the police: “I want you to beat down the door of the criminals and sort them out and antagonise them. That\u0027s what I say to my local police – three o\u0027clock in the morning and antagonise them.”It\u0027s all very refreshing, New Labour circa 1995 stuff. But there’s something implausible about it all. When Blair, as Shadow Home Secretary, coined the phrase “Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime”, it seemed very much in tune with what we knew of the man’s political philosophy at the time: impatient with the bleeding heart lefty liberals who had repeatedly driven the party over a cliff edge in their pursuit of “progressive” policies, only to alienate the same working class voters they had learned about at university.His subsequent initiatives, such as on-the-spot fines for anti-social behaviour and anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos), addressed local communities’ priorities without bothering too much with the chattering classes’ concerns for civil liberties. The same concerns they talked about endlessly at dinner parties in their nice, expensive homes in areas that weren’t subject to loutish behaviour.Rayner, having been brought up in a council estate and in relative poverty, is exactly the kind of politician who would normally be best placed to champion such an approach, all the alternatives having miserably failed to protect ordinary, decent, working people from the excesses of vandalism and harassment. But there’s a problem. There is a giant elephant in the room, and it answers to the name of Jeremy.For she was one of Corbyn’s most loyal lieutenants, having stepped up to serve in the shadow cabinet when everyone else resigned in protest at his leadership in June 2016. We must assume that she was one of the 40 loyalist MPs who supported him (as opposed to one of the 172 who opposed him) in that month’s vote of confidence.Is she really asking us to believe that these recently-expressed opinions are her real ones – opinions which she has kept secret these past few years and only now can be expressed sincerely?Quite aside from the (relatively unimportant) party politics aspect, there is the far more serious issue of civil liberties, which even Blair took more seriously than Rayner. The obvious example is that of Jean Charles de Menezes, the innocent Brazilian man shot and killed by anti-terrorist officers of the Met in 2005, supposedly on the basis that he looked a bit dodgy. That, it could be said, was an example of shooting now and asking questions later.If Rayner simply meant to endorse current police policy of shooting actual terrorists who are rampaging through the streets attacking civilians, then that’s something we can all get behind. But in that case her views perhaps need a touch of polish, an element of nuance, before they’re revealed to the wider world.The problem for Rayner and her party is that she may very well be expressing views that she has held for some time they may be sincerely held and thought through. Given her upbringing, it is entirely possible that she genuinely recognises the need to apply a tougher approach to community policing and to stop seeing assailants, vandals and general ne’er-do-wells as “victims” too.But in agreeing to serve a man who believed none of these things, in portraying herself as a hard-Left tribune of the people in whom Corbyn and his followers could place their trust, she threw away the chance to be listened to once that leader was no longer in post. She, together with Barry Gardiner, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Richard Burgon and many others, accepted fast-track promotion to the shadow cabinet when the opportunity presented itself (a sort of assisted places scheme for politicians), squandering any chance the party had to rid itself of Corbyn and his voter-repellent views.Perhaps we should be more patient with those who seek to reinvent themselves in office. Tony Benn did it, after all, albeit travelling in the opposite political direction to Rayner. But a consequence of that is that the public reserve the right to view her and her newfound orthodoxy with a degree of scepticism. If she plays her cards right, Angela Rayner has a long career ahead of her. She will need much of that time to convince others that this time, at last, she is being sincere.In the meantime, don’t expect Starmer, the former human rights lawyer and Director of Public Prosecutions, to appoint her as Shadow Home Secretary.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Britain should never seek \u0026#39special relationship\u0026#39 with EU, says Lord FrostEmmanuel Macron denies French withdrawal from Mali \u0026#39a failure\u0026#39Russia-Ukraine crisis: Invasion in \u0026#39next several days\u0026#39, says Joe BidenStorm Eunice could produce \u0026#39sting jet\u0026#39 like 1987 Great Storm ‘Look at the screen’, GP told blind patientMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"no vladimir putin hasnt humiliated west","story":"Only in the fantasy world that is Vladimir Putin’s Russia could the Kremlin seriously believe that the military stand-off over Ukraine has resulted in a humiliating defeat for the West. Mr Putin has deliberately provoked the Ukraine crisis with the aim of forcing the West to make painful concessions, such as denying Kyiv the opportunity to join Nato or withdrawing its military hardware from Eastern and central Europe.Yet, while the willingness of some Western leaders to maintain a firm line has, at times, been open to question, one of the more refreshing outcomes of the crisis is that the Western alliance has held firm. While French President Emmanuel Macron has shown an alarming willingness to undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz seems willing to rule out any future possibility of Ukraine joining Nato, the bottom line remains that, to date, no meaningful concessions have been made to Mr Putin on either issue. Instead, the Western alliance continues to discuss ways of crippling the Russian economy if Mr Putin is foolhardy enough to activate his invasion plans, demonstrating a level of resolve that has caught many off guard.The refusal to budge on Nato’s right to choose which nations can and cannot apply to join has certainly placed Mr Putin in a quandary, and may well explain why Moscow’s much-vaunted march on Kyiv – which US intelligence agencies had predicted would most likely take place yesterday morning – has yet to materialise.With an estimated 130,000-strong Russian battle group still camped on the Ukrainian border, such an eventuality cannot be discounted, and British security officials, together with their counterparts in the US and Europe, remain convinced that the Russian leader’s ultimate goal is to achieve regime change in Ukraine through military force. None the less, following the Russian defence ministry’s decision to release videos earlier this week of heavy armour being redeployed to barracks, hopes are rising that all-out conflict may yet be averted.For Mr Putin, who has spent much of the past few months stoking the flames of his latest confrontation with the West, the prospect of the crisis being resolved without him achieving any of his stated goals will be hard to accept. The Kremlin’s frustration that events are not moving in the right direction certainly helps to explain Moscow’s almost hysterical reaction earlier this week when Washington’s predictions of a looming Russian invasion failed to materialise.“They were humiliated and defeated without a single shot,” boasted Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova, adding that Russia’s failure to launch its invasion according to the CIA’s precise timetable “will go down in history as the day when Western war propaganda failed”.It still remains to be seen whether the West has badly misjudged Mr Putin’s intentions towards Ukraine, with the Biden administration continuing to warn that an invasion “remains distinctly possible”, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirming that Kyiv has yet to detect any meaningful sign of a Russian withdrawal.Keeping everyone guessing is very much how Mr Putin likes to conduct business, so that not even trusted aides like Sergey Lavrov, his veteran foreign minister, can know with any certainty their leader’s next move. And if Mr Putin can keep his key Kremlin confidantes in the dark, then what chance do his Western adversaries have of ining his objectives?Yet, for all his mind games, Mr Putin’s prospects of achieving any tangible political gains from the Ukraine crisis grow more remote by the day, irrespective of the narrative the Kremlin’s “fake news” machine seeks to conjure up.The Russian leader will look weak and inept if he pulls back from a full-scale invasion without obtaining any guarantees from Nato on Ukraine, or winning concessions from the alliance on its future military dispositions in eastern Europe. Furthermore, his aggressive stance towards Ukraine has forged a new unity of purpose within the alliance that has been sadly lacking since the fiasco of last summer’s withdrawal from Afghanistan. Mr Putin’s bellicose conduct on Europe’s doorstep has resulted in a significant uplift in defence spending among many member states, while previously neutral states such as Sweden and Finland are now giving serious consideration to applying for membership.If, by contrast, Mr Putin does press ahead with the invasion, he is unlikely to achieve a clear-cut victory. There is, for example, a growing consensus within Western security circles that the Kremlin has seriously underestimated the likelihood of Ukrainians launching a long and bloody resistance campaign, one that could ultimately prove very costly for Moscow.So, far from achieving a humiliating defeat of the West, as the Kremlin propaganda machine would have us believe, it is Mr Putin who has most to lose, whether he decides to invade or not.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Britain should never seek \u0026#39special relationship\u0026#39 with EU, says Lord FrostEmmanuel Macron denies French withdrawal from Mali \u0026#39a failure\u0026#39Russia-Ukraine crisis: Invasion in \u0026#39next several days\u0026#39, says Joe BidenStorm Eunice could produce \u0026#39sting jet\u0026#39 like 1987 Great Storm ‘Look at the screen’, GP told blind patientMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dwp universal credit sanctions soar","story":"Exclusive: DWP Universal Credit sanctions soar to , a month in extremely worrying riseThe number of sanctions has shot from a few thousand a month to , - a similar proportion to before the pandemic - after the DWP brought back face-to-face Jobcentre appointments.

The shocking rise comes as millions of people are hit by rising living costs, with energy bills, National Insurance and inflation all surging this Spring while benefits rise by only .%.Sanctions were suspended in the first Covid lockdown, and remained low at first after being restored in summer . But they have soared since the Department for Work and Pensionsbrought back face-to-face Jobcentre appointments last April, with people who miss a session having their benefits cut or stopped.The number of Universal Credit claimants with a sanction rose from , in June  to , in November , the most recent month available. Scroll down for the full figures and join the debate in the comments. Have you received an unfair sanction  Tell us on webnews@mirror. The total number of people sanctioned across the whole month will be higher than the official figures, as they are taken on a particular day each month. The data also excludes Universal Credit claimants who are not in ‘conditionality’ groups, such as severely disabled people.And Tory ministers are now introducing even tighter rules, with claimants facing a sanction after four weeksthey refuse a job outside their chosen field, which could push sanctions higher. Anti-austerity activist Charlotte Hughes warned it was “extremely worrying as we face a huge cost of living crisis putting energy and food prices up”. She added: “Sanctions are a cruel and unnecessary tool to use against those that are already poor and living in poverty. “Benefit sanctions ensure a person or a family are dragged further into poverty, making them have to choose whether they can eat or heat for the duration of their sanction.“Sanctioning claimants creates a never ending circle of poverty and does not encourage anyone to look for more work.” Dr David Webster of the University of Glasgow, who has researched the impact of sanctions for years, said: “The impact of a sanction often lasts a long time. “If it causes a crisis in the family, orit leads to somebody being evicted, the effects are pretty long-lasting. “Sanctions drive people further into debt, because obviously people can’t stop spending money altogether – they have to find something to eat and so on. “They have to keep spending money, somoney isn’t coming in they’re going to have to borrow it, and they get further in debt. “That has damaging effects on their mental health, because there’s all the anxiety and stress. And for a minority of people there’s obviously the question of potential eviction.”  The sharp rise comes even as the overall number of Universal Credit claimants has fallen with the reopening of the economy. DWP figures this week show .% of claimants were subject to a sanction in November, a similar proportion to before the pandemic. That is up from .% in October and .% in September. “If you look at the trend, there’s really virtually no slackening in the pace of increase in that percentage – it’s heading skywards,” said Dr Webster. The DWP’s recently announced Way to Work scheme will soon force claimants to look for jobs outside their chosen field after just four weeks on Universal Credit. A DWP spokesperson said: “With a record number of jobs available, it’s right that people who can work are encouraged to take up suitable roles through our Way to Work scheme. As well as being good for mental wellbeing, people are at least £, better off in full time work than on benefits. “People are only sanctionedthey fail, without good reason, to meet the conditions which they agreed to, and the latest data shows the sanctions rate remains below pre-pandemic levels.”Sanctions by month Figure is the number of people on the Universal Credit full service receiving a sanction on the second Thursday of each month.

The Labour leader said he was on a mission to prevent Labour being linked to anti-Semitism for good - and did not rule out putting forward a candidate in Mr Corbynaposs seat at the next election. Mr Corbyn was suspended from Labour in October  over his reaction to a damning report on handling of allegations of anti-Jewish hate within the partyaposs ranks.He has represented Islington North since  but he would have to stand as an independent candidatehe fails to regain the whip by the next election.

Asked how he planned to ensure Labour upheld the values he hoped to roll out across the country, Mr Starmer said: “I said I would tear anti-Semitism out of the party by the roots in my acceptance speech. “We have been doing that and we have made progress on it.”Pressed on whether that would include standing a Labour candidate in Mr Corbyn’s seat, Mr Starmer said: “Well, Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t have a Labour whip at the moment.“That’s the position he finds himself in, and it’s down to the response he made to the report on anti-Semitism.” It follows claims Mr Corbyn could be deselected by the party in his safe seat of Islington North, which he has held since .It is understood he plans to stand at the next general election, whether it is for Labour or as an independent candidate. Mr Starmer also promised he is taking allegations of Islamophobia as seriously as anti-Semitism. “There is absolutely no hierarchy here, he said. “We have to root out Islamophobia in just the same way as weaposd have to root out anti-Semitism. “And we do it with the same determination and energy.

The government would also have to give “a full list of the names of any elected officials, senior civil servants, and political appointees” who are fined by police.This comes after the police and government suggested anyone who is fined will not be named, with Brits having to rely on Boris Johnson naming himself.But it is only an Early Day Motion designed to voice opinions on issues of the day, without a House of Commons debate. Tory ministers are under no obligation to give it any debating time, let alone a formal vote, on the floor of Parliament.And it’s understood Labour is not ordering its MPs to sign the motion. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey urged MPs to back the motion regardless. He said: “Boris Johnson can’t be trusted to admit whether he or any other Conservative ministers end up being fined by the police. “We’ve seen time and again that his instinct is to lie, blame others or cover up the truth.” No staff feared publishing the damning pictures could harm their reputations, according to the Times. The Mirror has learned one photo shows Boris Johnson holding a bottle of beer at his own birthday party and was taken by his official photographer.Boris Johnson has until tomorrow night tohis Met Police Partygate questionnaire. The Prime Minister was issued with the quiz last Friday - and given seven days to send back the completed form.  He has been consulting lawyers over his responses - and is expected to resist any attempts to oust himhe is slapped with a fine.London mayor Sadiq Khan said it would be inappropriate for him to lean on police and ask them to release photos of the Downing Street parties.He told LBC: Just think how inappropriate it would be for me, a Labour Mayor, getting involved in operational matters where a Conservative politician is being investigated. There are some countries around the world where the police do have their arms twisted in relation to operational issues. I think it is right in our system where I have got no influence in relation to whether the police do investigate Boris Johnson, what is published and so forth. I have always, as the Mayor, been cognisant of the importance of me understanding which side of the line I should be on. Mr Johnson has already admitted attending some of the  gatherings under investigation - including  minutes at a birthday party in his honour, where a photo showed him holding a beer.But according toITVpolitical editor Robert Peston, the PM’s lawyers now believe the relevant test is whether he ed to “proper work” after the gatherings.Well-connected Mr Peston wrote: “If he can prove that he didnapost get drunk and incapacitated, and has proof that he resumed more conventional prime ministerial activities after the seeming parties, his legal advisors seem to think there is a chance he can prove said events were simply part of his working day. “Andhe got sozzled and went for a kip, heaposd be fined.” Adam Wagner, a human rights barrister who analyses Covid lockdown laws, said the argument about whether the PM went back to work afterwards is “irrelevant”. He told the Mirror: “It doesn’t matter what he did before or afterwards - the question is did he participate, andhe spent  minutes at a birthday gathering and there is a photo of him carrying a bottle of beer then he participated. “If someone was working in a building in central London and in the next room there was a rave, and they just popped into the rave for  minutes, it would be absurd to say they had a reasonable excuse. “There is no technical defence of ‘I went back to work’ - there is no technical defence of ‘I didn’t get drunk’. “’I held the beer, I didn’t get drunk’ is like Bill Clinton’s ‘I smoked marijuana but I didn’t inhale’ - it’s nonsense. I don’t understand that to be a defence which could work in the regulations.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonConservative PartyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Prince Andrew has agreed to pay a reported £ million following his out-of-court agreement with Ms Giuffre who was suing him for sexual abuse after claiming she was trafficked by his friend and convicted sex offender Jeffery Epstein.The Duke of York has always vehemently denied the allegations made against him. The scandal, which has left Andrewaposs reputation in tatters, risks further damaging the monarchythe perception remains that he has escaped any financial obligations, lawyer Mark Stephens has said. Labouraposs McDonald said he is going to raise the issue when MPsto Westminster next week following their half-term break. This is a person of very high profile involved in a case where his position of authority and privilege has been allegedly abused and it is an enormous sum of money, he told BBCaposs Newsnight.  We donapost know the precise figure but there is a risk that this will be at the publicaposs expense so we need to have that resolved. We need to know exactly where this money is coming from. I am going to take the opportunity to raise this issue in Parliament because the issue isnapost going to go away until people have that information and receive assurances that public money is not going to be used to in any way contribute to the settlement. Andrew had said he wanted a jury trial to contest the allegations in court, but he has opted to reach a settlement with Ms Giuffre and now regrets his association with disgraced financier Epstein, a letter submitted to the United States District Court stated. Andrew agreed to make a substantial donation to his accuseraposs charity after the pair came to the undisclosed out-of-court settlement. Mr Stephens, an international reputation lawyer from the firm Howard Kennedy, said the duke will have to give details of where the settlement money is from or risk more reputational damage to the monarchy.  He said: I think thereaposs equal concern that it comes from the royal family and what they want to see is that Andrew is paying out of his own pocket - that heaposs personally being financially punished here. And I think heaposs going to have to clary within the next  to  hours from his team, that itaposs come from his own private resources or will do. Although the parties have settled the case, the agreement is not an admission of guilt and he has always strenuously denied the allegations against him. No detail has been disclosed with regard to the settlement and costs, but it has been reported he has agreed to pay around £ million to Ms Giuffre and a further £ million to her charity, with speculation the Queen might help with costs from her private funds. Andrew is reportedly in the process of selling his Swiss ski chalet with the property expected to generate millions in funds.  The public, and not a jury, will now decide who they believe after the settlement which ended the prospect of an autumn trial in the civil case, said Gloria Allred, a US lawyer who represented several of Epsteinaposs victims.Speaking to BBC Radio aposs Today programme, Ms Allred said: This case will be dismissed, then each will go their own way and he will never end up testying under oath, at least not this case, and the public will just have to decide who they believe. Ms Giuffre made a claim against Andrew for damages in her home country of the US, claiming she was trafficked by Epstein to have sex with the royal when she was , a minor under US law. The settlement agreement states that Andrew will donate to Ms Giuffreaposs charity in support of victimsapos rights and that he has pledged to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims. Last month, the Queen stripped Andrew of his remaining patronages and honorary military roles as the monarchy distanced itself from the duke ahead of potentially damaging developments in his lawsuit.

A US senior administration official last night blasted Russiaaposs claim it was withdrawing troops from the border with Ukraine. They received a lot of attention for that claim, both here and around the world. But we now know it was , the official said. The anonymous official said Russia has increased its troop presence along the Ukrainian border by as many as , troops, with many of them arriving as recently as Wednesday. No details or evidence were given of how the US knew this to be the case. But the , figure was today backed by UK Armed Forces minister James Heappey. He said Britain has not necessarily been able to very the , figure, but warned imagery overnight showed a new bridge and a large field hospital and he was very worried. “Troop movements towards the border continue”, Mr Heappey told the BBC. For all the talk about de-escalation in Moscow, I’m afraid what we’re seeing in the opposite and we’re very worried about it.  He added: “All of the conditions are set, and from the moment President Putin takes a decision, it is literally just a matter of minutes before military effect could be felt in Ukrainian cities. “That’s dferent however to inevitability. I have a gut feeling because I’m seeing what I’m seeing, and I don’t think you spend that amount of money in putting that number of troops and planes and ships into an area unless you mean it.But I have hope that a diplomatic process can succeed, because the consequences of that not being the case are that tens of thousands of people could die.” The UKaposs Lieutenant General Sir Jim Hockenhull, the Chief of Defence Intelligence, added: Contrary to their claims, Russia continues to build up military capabilities near Ukraine. This includes sightings of additional armoured vehicles, helicopters and a field hospital moving towards Ukraineaposs borders. Russia has the military mass in place to conduct an invasion of Ukraine. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss warned Moscow could drag out the crisis for months in an attempt to undermine Western unity.  Moscow denies it has any plans to invade, and Russiaaposs defence ministry said yesterday its forces were pulling back after exercises near Ukraine. It published video that it said showed forces leaving the Crimean peninsula. But Ms Truss said it was essential the UK and its allies not be lulled into a  sense of security, adding: In fact the Russian military build-up shows no signs of slowing. We must have no illusions that Russia could drag this out much longer in a brazen ploy to spend weeks more -not months - subverting Ukraine and challenging Western unity. This is a test of our mettle. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in an interview on MSNBC on Wednesday that critical units were moving towards the border. On Tuesday, US President Joe Biden said the United States estimated that , Russian troops had encircled Ukraine, an increase from previous estimates of about ,. Russia had said that its forces - part of a huge buildup that has been accompanied by demands to the West for sweeping security guarantees - were pulling back after taking part in exercises in southern and western military districts near Ukraine.  But NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said moving troops and tanks back and forth did not amount to proof of a pullout. Liz Truss will reaffirm support for Ukrainian sovereignty on a trip to Kyiv this week as part of efforts to deter a possible Russian invasion, urging Moscow to end its military buildup along the border. Truss will hold talks with Ukraineaposs Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and will then deliver a speech in Kyiv where she will warn Russia it faces economic pain and global isolationit invades its former Soviet neighbour. In a speech in Kyiv, the Foreign Secretary will say the path of diplomacy remains openMoscow really does want a peaceful resolute to the crisis . We are ready to talk. But we are very clear -they decide to continue down the path of aggression, there will be massive consequences bringing Russia severe economic costs and pariah status, she will say. Following her visits to Ukraine and Poland, Ms Truss will travel on to attend the Munich Security Conference with other Nato foreign and defence ministers.  Russiaaposs deputy ambassador to the United Nations Dmitry Polyanskiy again dismissed the claims as fantasies by Western politicians. This is a very ridiculous situation, there has been hysteria, even hype, fanned for several weeks by our Western colleagues, he told ITVaposs Peston programme. They convinced each other and the whole world that Russia was about to invade, they were even naming concrete dates. So it happened in their minds, in their heads. Britain has already said it is doubling the number of troops in Estonia, with around  members of The Royal Welsh battlegroup heading from Sennelager in Germany and bases in Europe for the Baltic state, while  Royal Marine commandos are being despatched to Poland.  Four additional RAF Typhoon jets are heading to Cyprus to join Nato patrols over eastern Europe while offshore patrol vessel HMS Trent will shortly be joined in the eastern Mediterranean by HMS Diamond, a Type  destroyer. Meanwhile, so-called golden visas for wealthy foreign investors are expected to be scrapped by the Government amid concerns over links between Russia and the UK. Those eligible for the tier one investor visa, launched in , must have at least £ million in investment funds and have a UK bank account. It has been under review due to repeated concerns that the system could be exploited because not enough background checks are made on applicants. Sources confirmed the scheme will be abandoned in an announcement to be made next week. Lib Dem Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Layla Moran said: “The Conservatives have turned a blind eye to Russian interference in this country for years and had an open door policy to Kremlin cronies.“Cancelling the scheme is long overdue, it shouldnapost have taken the threat of a defeat in Parliament to finally get this Government to act.”Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON SoldiersUkraine crisis\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Floriaposs Friends Rescue “couldn’t save her mobility” and called her the charityaposs hardest challenge to date. Despite a dficult and long road ahead, there was no doubt in Natalia’s mind that she would do everything she could to help the puppy live. “I have a duty of care.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

Forever tainted Andrew’s banishment from public le must be permanent after paying his sex abuse accuser a substantial sum to settle sordid charges he denied. Because the court of public opinion will reach its own verdict on the U-turning prince now commending the bravery of a victim, Virginia Giuffre, his team disgracefully accused of lying in a stomach-churning smear campaign. And hoisting the white flag over Buckingham Palace to avoid a court inquisition means a man who until yesterday considered it honourable to be the guest of a convicted paedophile can never openly clear his name.  The donation to Giuffre’s charity combined with avow to campaign against sex trafficking and that apology indicate who won. She did. He still lost. The question remains unanswered about what to do with befouled Uncle Andrew despite relief in royal circles an Emily Maitlis mauling with knobs on is averted in a New York courtroom. Sneak him into platinum jubilee celebrations and the Queen will besmirch  years to rehabilitate a favourite son who’d be safer for the family locked in the Tower. Stripping him of a few courtesy titles and recognising the armed forces want nothing to do with Andrew isn’t enough.  The riot act must be read to him and a public declaration there is no way back nailed to the gates of Windsor Castle. Andrew remaining ninth in line to the throne and continuing to enjoy the perks of royalty is an insult to all women. It also goes to the heart of the rottenness of a hereditary monarchy, permanently elevating one family over millions of better others.

The Prince had long denied all claims against him, and during the interview, he even said he had never met Giuffre. However, he will reportedly pay a £million settlement after being ordered by the Queen and Prince Charles to sort the sex abuse case out. The terms of the deal prevent either side from discussing the case or the settlement itself in public - and the settlement is believed to have been made on the basis Prince Andrew makes no admission of liability and denies all allegations made against him.The total figure for the settlement will stand at more than £m, according to The .Writing on the BBC website, Emily Maitlis has said that the Duke’s settlement fails to match up with the answers he gave her. She said: “At the heart of the settlement is the biggest question of all: why is a prince who told me he had no recollection of ever meeting this lady now paying her what we understand to be upwards of £m  I distinctly remember putting Virginia Giuffreaposs accusations to him directly: aposShe says she met you in , she dined with you, danced with you, you bought her drinks in Tramp nightclub and she went on to have sex with you in a house in Belgravia.apos  “And I have the Princeaposs reply in front of me now. Three words only: ‘It didnapost happen.’” Because of this, she said there were only three possible explanations. “Either he was lying in that response - and remembered her well. “Or he genuinely had no recollection - and was adamant they hadnapost met - only for his memory subsequently to be jogged. “Or that he maintains his innocence, but feels the weight of legal and public opinion against him now make settling the easier option, albeit without accepting any liability.”She highlighted something the prince has come under increasing fire for, paying up such a vast amount of money to someone he was adamant he had not met. Maitlis also spoke about the preparation that went into the interview that she said would be “as forensic as any court document.” She added that she would be disappointed journalistically that “we won’t get to see how this story played out.” The veteran journalist does not stop there, she digs further into the Duke’s statement and points out the gulf between acknowledging Giuffre’s pain and any responsibility he may have for causing it. Throughout, she points out, the Duke does not acknowledge that they met. She goes on to highlight how Andrew backtracked, now regretting his friendship and closeness to Jeffrey Epstein. She wrote: “I asked him specicallyhe regretted the whole friendship with Epstein. And I remember my own inward gasp when he said: ‘No, still not... and the reason being that the people that I met and the opportunities that I was given to learn...were actually very useful.’  “In other words, that friendship was something he still valued two years ago. So why does he regret it now  Or does he only regret that it has become a source of such immense subsequent damage ” She added: “Youaposll remember perhaps that when I asked him why heaposd chosen to stay at the Manhattan home of a man whom he knew to be a convicted sex offender he told me he believed it was ‘the honourable and right thing to do’. “And then explained: ‘I admit my judgement was probably coloured by my tendency to be too honourable.’ A phrase that has in its own way become as legendary as the references to sweat and Pizza Express.” Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Andrew, Duke of YorkPrince Charles, Prince of WalesBBCRoyal FamilyCrimeCar crashes\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

With the Queen having reached the landmark of  years on the throne, attention is beginning to turn to what the future of the monarchy may look like once the Prince of Wales takes over.Previous reports suggested that Prince Charles intends to “slim down” the monarchy before his coronation and that only Prince William, Kate Middleton and their children would join him on the balcony when he becomes King. However, commentator Christine Ross told the Royally Us podcast that there might still be space for Harry and Meghan to be involved on coronation day.She said: Because of that historical moment where you have Charles, William and George, we’ll probably see them front and centre and their families front and centre. However, Christine added: “I do imagine that Charles will want a larger family group shot of the existing Royal Family.”The royal commentator explained that this might include wider family members such as Charles’ nieces and nephews – except Prince Andrew – and suggested this could allow Harry and Meghan a way in. “I do think that Harry would be a part of that and Meghan may be as wellshe wanted to be,” she noted. “I only say that because that’s such a public forum for her, and we know that she’s maybe hesitant to travel or to put herself in that situation again where the British press can speak about her in that way. “So I don’t think it would be so much about family feuds, as kind of indicating the future of the monarchy and also making everybody happy.”The Queen was surrounded by her family and maids of honour when she waved to huge crowds below the palace after her coronation in .A source told the Mail On Sunday that Charles wants his coronation to be far cheaper than the Queenaposs ceremony, which cost £.m - the equivalent of £m today.The plans for Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall’s coronation, which is due to happen within a year of his accession, are being discussed as part of Operation Golden Orb.

Des Louza, a technical engineer from Wolverhampton, had no previous health conditions but rapidly deteriorated just a week after contracting the virus, reports BirminghamLive. Coronavirus visiting restrictions in the hospital meant he could only speak to his family for just  seconds over the phone before he was rushed to a new ward and placed in a coma. The granddad of three spent the next five weeks fighting for his le but tragically died last March.Now, his daughter is now fundraising to help keep National Covid Memorial Wall a permanent fixture in London. His daughter Jodie Louza said: He must have been panicking. He was very weak and he just said bye and I think in his head he thought he wouldnapost get to say bye to us. We had a -second phone call with him. We could tell it was taking all his strength to say bye, thataposs all he could physically say. We were just distraught. You can’t really prepare for that - not being able to see him or be next to him. It was really tough. The -year-old added: My dad was the picture of health for his age.  You really donapost know how easily it could be you or someone you love. People should not forget that it’s still out there. The last text he sent to his daughter was I’m doing my best to fight this, Jodie recalled. Technical engineer Mr Louza worked for firm Atlas Copco throughout the pandemic until he fell ill with coronavirus in December . Jodie and her mum Kate, , looked after him for about a week at their Bilston home and both caught coronavirus themselves in the process.  But five weeks after being placed in the coma, the close-knit family were only able to visit him when medics called to say he was not going to make it. Jodie and mum Kate - who was married to Mr Louza for almost  years - went to the Covid ward, donning HAZMAT suits and helmets to say their final goodbyes. Her two heartbroken brothers stayed behind after becoming terried they would end up catching Covid for the first time. Jodie, a receptionist, said: They couldnapost understand why it affected him in the way that it did. They were hoping they could wake him up.  We couldnapost hold him and be normal. It was heartbreaking, really hard to digest. I was stubborn, I kept telling myself he will keep fighting. He was a fighter and a very strong man. I had never seen him ill before. He was very into his health and fitness. He was very humble. He was very fit. He had looked the same since he was , he did not age. It was such a shock. He was brilliant with his advice, he was loved. We would always have family game nights and he was really competitive and didn’t like to lose. He was an inspiration. I still canapost really comprehend it. It’s nearly been a year and I still donapost understand it. Jodie added the family are unsure where he contracted Covid, as he strictly followed the rules. It could have been something as simple as someone in the supermarket passing him. He really deteriorated rapidly, she added.Just three days after Mr Louza died, the devastated family received an NHS letter saying he was now eligible for the vaccine.Jodie added: It was unimaginable. I was very worried about Covid. I had a lot of people in my age bracket saying it wouldnapost be that bad. It’s the worst thing in the world. Unless you have been through this, it’s hard to realise how dficult it is. He didnapost have the funeral he should have had, it was really controlled and not what we would have wanted. Jodie is now planning on running the Carver Wolverhampton Half Marathon in April in memory of her cherished dad. She has already raised more than £ for The National Covid Memorial Wall - a London-based mural honouring those lost during the pandemic. She said: I think he would be proud. I would like to think he would be at the finish line. I needed something to motivate me, to work towards. I think it’s easy to get lost in grief. It makes me feel better knowing I am doing something in his memory and knowing it’s going to benefit other people because I know we are not the only ones who have been through this.To donate to the familyaposs fundraiser, visit Jodieaposs GoFundMe.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The National Police Air Servicetweeted footage of their helicopter being blasted by gusts of up to mph.They said: As the weather forecast predicted, itaposs slightly bumpy out there tonight.As a pilot attempts to steer the chopper straight, the view from his window shows the aircraft being tossed in the winds.It comes as millions of Brits endured a fretful night as huge gusts of around mph battered parts of the UK, with Storm Eunice set to hit even harder tomorrow.But it has been warned Eunice, sweeping up from the south west, will be even worse with a severe red weather warning already in place with people urged to be aware of flying debris- especially in coastal areas.The aposdanger to leapos alert has prompted government ministers to hold a COBRA meeting this morning to discuss the response to oncoming Eunice amid an ongoing clean-up operation following Storm Dudley. The red warning for winds has been issued for parts of the south west of England and south Wales, with severe gusts expected from am until around midday tomorrow.  Experts have warned the storm could be one of the strongest since the Burns Day Storm in  and are urging Brits to stay indoors. The Burns Day Storm - which started on the birthday of the famed Scottish poet - resulted in wind speeds of mph in Aberporth, Wales, on January  . Met Office forecaster Becky Mitchell told The Mirror: With the wind gusts we are forecasting at the moment, weaposve only seen a handful of storms in the past  years that have brought similar gusts. Itaposs got the potential to be up there as quite a notable storm. Winds are likely to be  to mph inland across the south of the UK. Itaposs quite unusual, we donapost see gusts that high over such a wide area in the south. The Burns Day Storm brought similar gusts. The red warning reads: The Met Office has issued a rare Red Weather Warning as Storm Eunice is expected to bring extremely strong winds and continued disruption for much of the UK on Friday. The Red Weather Warning for wind covers southwest coastal areas of the UK, where the most signicant gusts in exposed areas could be in excess of mph from early Friday morning.Further inland and within the wider Amber Warning area, gusts will still be signicant and damaging for many, with -mph gusts possible. With such severe weather impacting the UK, people should stay up to date with the latest warnings as they could be updated.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Met Office\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Met Police also opened an investigation into claims Prince Charles’s charity offered honours to wealthy donorsThe Queen is celebrating her Platinum Jubilee this year Image: Getty ImagesopinionByVoice of the Mirror:,  Feb This should have been a year of undimmed celebration for the Queen as the country marks her Platinum Jubilee. While the nation’s affection for Her Majesty remains undiminished, the reputation of the Royal Family has been tarnished by Prince Andrew’s unsavoury court case. To add to the Queen’s woes, the politan Police has opened an investigation into claims Prince Charles’s charity offered honours to wealthy donors. Clarence House insists Charles did not know what was happening at his foundation and is not involved in its day-to-day running. But the revelation is another blight on what should be a momentous year for the House of Windsor. For the Royal Family to be hit by one scandal is unfortunate but to be rocked by two in as many days is deeply embarrassing. The Queen described the year of  which saw the separation of Charles and Diana, the orce of Princess Anne and the fire at Windsor Castle as her annus horribilis. It would be deeply unfair on her Majestythe year in which she marks  years on the throne turns out to be equally grim.  Paying the price Soaring inflation is another blow to households hit by sky-high fuel bills. Prices are now outstripping wages and the recent increases in pensions and benefits. Rishi Sunak claims he understands the pressures on family finances. But he is still pressing ahead with a National Insurance rise this April. If the Chancellor genuinely cares about the cost of living crisis he would rethink this tax hike and help people more with heating bills. He should also send a clear signal to bosses that workers deserve a rise. Working people should not have to pay the price for this Government’s economic mismanagement.  Double trouble Forecasters warn that Storm Eunice could be the worst one in decades. Coming hot on the heels of Storm Dudley, there really is no calm before the storm.

Rendall  Rittner, which claims it is aposLondonaposs leading independent managing agentapos, held the hearing in his absence and he was sacked.  But now, Mr Hayes - who faced disciplinary proceedings for allegedly throwing a bag of poo and urine at a van - is in line to receive compensation after successfully suing the building management firm. An employment tribunal ruled Rendall  Rittner failed to make a reasonable adjustment by not reorganising the hearing for a third time by phone. Mr Hayes, who suffers anxiety, was left in extreme distress after twice not being able to access the Teams hearings, the tribunal heard. Mr Hayes, employed by Rendall  Rittner from April , worked at the Long and Waterson apartment building in Shoreditch, London. In February , contractors who Mr Hayes had animosity with complained to the company about an incident. A tribunal report said: Contractors complained...someone had put a bag on a contractoraposs vehicle which was said to contain excrement and was soaked in urine. [Rendall  Rittner property manager Ross Facta] looked at the CCTV and found footage of an item landing on the van. He then found footage of Mr Hayes throwing an item from the area known as the podium above the van. He also found footage showing him coming out of the staff room, walking through the foyer with something in his hand before going up to the podium. When investigated, Mr Hayes claimed he threw a tissue. He was called to a disciplinary hearing as the pandemic hit and was invited to attend a Microsoft Teams hearing on March , . The report said: [Rendall  Rittner] prepared a Microsoft Teams invitation whereby a hyperlink was sent by email.  This email did not give any instructions as to how to join. Microsoft Teams could be accessed via the internet by clicking the link. We accept Mr Hayes did not know what Microsoft Teams was, he did not have a camera on his desktop computer and could not connect. This was week two of the first pandemic lockdown. Many people did not know at that stage about Microsoft Teams and had not used it. After  minutes of waiting, an HR adviser rescheduled it. Another Teams link was sent to him, the report continued. [He was warned]he did not attend without reasonable cause or explanation then a decision may be taken in his absence. Mr Hayes did not attend. Mr Hayes did not try to find out about how to attend the disciplinary because he was both extremely anxious and because he was annoyed that the company had not given him an explanation of how to attend, it was heard. He said to the HR adviser aposhe did not know what Microsoft Teams was and asked her how she was so confident that he could use it at home. Mr Hayes expressed his anxiety was so bad he even had thoughts of taking his own le. Employment Judge Moor, sitting at the London East tribunal, said his anxiety was a factor in him not accessing Teams. Judge Moor said: We have concluded that there was a substantial dference between his ability to respond to the connection dficulties and a non-disabled personaposs. We have considered this with some care. It has not been an easy decision. It was a substantial dference because his extreme anxiety was very much part of the reason why he did not try to find an alternative way to attend the hearing on the day. A non-disabled person would not have had this additional mental obstacle. Judge Moor said Rendall  Rittner aposought to have knownapos his anxiety was a factor in him not contacting them about Teams and concluded they were unreasonable in proceeding in his absence and not rescheduling a third hearing by phone. Mr Hayes, who was sacked on April , , following the hearing in his absence, won a claim of failure to make reasonable adjustments for a disabled employee. Compensation will be determined at a later date. Mr Hayes lost other claims of unfair dismissal, harassment, and whistle-blowing. At the disciplinary hearing, Rendall  Rittner concluded Mr Hayes was guilty of misconduct for throwing the object from the building deliberately, but that Mr Hayes was not aiming at the bin lorry and it was not conclusive as to what was inside but that he could have urinated on it.The Samaritans is available  you need to talk.

The Met Office urged Brits to stay indoors as much as possible as the storm looks set to make landfall on Friday, February .It has also issued danger to le amber warning covering almost the whole of England for tomorrow.Storm Eunice is expected to cause further outages and disruption to the transport network, after Storm Dudley left thousands without power and travel chaos in its wake.Here’s a map of the exact areas expected to be hit by Storm Eunice.

Elaina Serghi, , has written heartbreaking notes to her young children to read after her death - but believes things could have been very dferent. Her family has turned to crowdfunding in the hope of accessing private treatment that can ensure she is there for children Leo, six, and Christina, three, for as long as possible. Latest figures show cancer treatment times have reached a record high as the government faces calls to deal with the huge backlog. Elaina, from Manchester, told The Mirror she had to wait for two months for a colonoscopy after falling ill in early , and an operation to remove a tumour was put back by more than a week.She was too ill to begin immediate chemotherapy after surgery and learned late last year that the disease, which started in her colon, had spread to her lungs and stomach. Elaina said: I want to be around for as long as I can, at my age I shouldnapost be writing notes for my kids to readI die, itaposs heartbreaking. I genuinely think it could have been dferent or at least not as bad. Elaina is among thousands who have turned to crowdfunding in the hope of extending her le, with more than £, raised toward private treatment after the disease spread. She said: Itaposs spread to my stomach now, Iaposm just hoping that new drugs will give me a bit longer with my family, thataposs all I can ask.  Itaposs really bad, cancer patients are being neglected. Itaposs not fair what weaposve gone through, Iaposve got two young children who need me.Elainaaposs family have launched a GoFundMe appeal to help pay for private healthcare and drugs to prolong her le.So far more than £, has been raised to support her. The moving appeal, set up by cousin Ana Papathomas, states: Heartbreaklingly, the chance to continue this fight has been taken from her. The only treatment which offers hope is not available on the NHS. It can only be obtained privately. Elainaaposs only way to keep fighting is to seek funding for this treatment. As you can imagine, this is not cheap and while it didnapost come easy for Elaina to take this decision and reach out for help, her single-minded desire to survive, to live, has left her with no other choice. Campaigners have called on the Government to prioritise dealing with the UKaposs huge cancer backlog, with more and more forced to turn to crowdfunding as the disease progressed. An estimated , people with suspected cancer will have to wait longer than two weeks to see an oncologist this year, Government analysis showed.And it is expected that more than , will not start treatment within the  or  day targets set by hospitals. Craig Russell, whose daughter Kelly Smith died aged just  in June  after her treatment was paused at the start of the pandemic, said more and more people are having to turn to crowdfunding.Craig, who set up the Catch up on Cancer campaign following Kellyaposs death, said: Iaposve heard far too many stories, there are lots of loved ones who have lost ones avoidably. Everyone is arguing about who is driving the fire engine, but the house is still burning down.He said the governmentaposs target to bring waiting times to pre-pandemic levels by next year simply isnapost good enough. Theyaposre saying itaposll take  months to get back to mediocrity, thataposs not the way we should be dealing with cancer patients, he said. He is haunted by the possibility that mum-of-one Kelly, from Macclesfield, could have lived longerher appointments had not stopped. There are questions over whether something could have been done, that makes it impossible to reconcile, Craig, , said. That question - have we been cheated out of six months, six years,  years - you just donapost know. The thought of other people going through this is heartbreaking. Minesh Patel, head of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support, said after figures were published last week: We know this will be having a devastating impact on many people with cancer who are experiencing agonising delays and risk a worse prognosis.In a statement the Department of Health and Social Care said: “Cancer diagnosis and treatment remains a top priority. The pandemic has put enormous pressures on the NHS, causing waiting lists to grow, but now most cancer services are back to or above pre-pandemic levels.“Our record investment in the NHS includes an extra £bn this year and £bn over the next three years to cut waiting times, including through delivering an extra  million checks, scans and operations, making sure more patients get the treatment they need sooner. “Last week the health and social care secretary declared a national war on cancer, with the launch of a call for evidence to inform a new -year plan to improve cancer care, speed up diagnosis and invest in innovative new treatments.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A spokesperson for her housing company Plymouth Community Homessaid this was not the case and insisted they are working closely and sympathetically with her.The young mum, who moved into her home last May, claims her house is freezing cold after water began pouring in and claims sheaposs been electrocuted twice,  PlymouthLive reports.After an electrician inspected her home the shower blew which she says goes to prove that water is getting into the sockets.  She told PlymouthLive: Weaposve got water coming down the walls, itaposs freezing cold and weaposve got mould coming through in my little boyaposs room. We first noticed it around Christmas time because my grandad and grandma stayed with us and when my grandad got out of bed he put his hand on one of the walls and it was soaking wet. An electrician allegedly accused Chan of drawing the mould on the wall of her sonaposs bedroom with a pen. But Chan says the only action PCH has allegedly taken is to wipe the water away.  Carl Brazier, Director of Homes  Neighbourhoods said when PCH was first made aware of the issue alternative accommodation was arranged. He said: When we first became aware of the issues, we arranged alternative accommodation for Chantal and her son while we fully investigated the problems. Since then, we have carried out roof repairs and checked that the roof is not leaking, as well as adding extra insulation in the loft, all of which has remained dry. However, Chan claims after she contacted PCH a housing officer was sent out - but he was far from sympathetic to her situation and even accused her of spraying the water herself. She said: Theysent one of the housing officers out to have a look and he accused me of spraying the walls with water myself. My mum said, aposwho wakes up and thinks Iaposm going to water my walls today.apos Chan says most walls in her flat have been impacted by the leak and the accusation made her feel stupid and embarrassed, as well as upset that PCH had thought she would do this herself. Carl Brazier added: Chantal’s home has been visited by electricians, repairs supervisors, senior housing officers and contractors who have confirmed that the insulation above the fittings and fuse board is also dry, so we are still trying to determine where the water is coming from. “We are continuing to work with Chantal to find the cause of the problem, with our housing management and repairs teams having visited again early this week and we are committed to resolving the problem at the earliest opportunity. The PCH tenant says she believes the water entered a number of plug sockets making them unsafe, especially for a young child. The current condition of the home has become so bad Chan and her son have decided to move into her parentaposs house. She said: Theyaposve told me they will change the roof but they just wonapost tell me when because itaposs not an emergency. They donapost know where itaposs coming from so thataposs why theyaposre accusing me. Itaposs so wet weaposve had to come back to my mum and dadaposs house.  A spokesperson for Plymouth Community Homes, Carl Brazier, Director of Homes  Neighbourhoods said: “We have been working closely and sympathetically with Chantal and offering her support during this time so we can get to the bottom of the problems that she has been experiencing. “When we first became aware of the issues, we arranged alternative accommodation for Chantal and her son while we fully investigated the problems. Since then, we have carried out roof repairs and checked that the roof is not leaking, as well as adding extra insulation in the loft, all of which has remained dry. “Chantal’s home has been visited by electricians, repairs supervisors, senior housing officers and contractors who have confirmed that the insulation above the fittings and fuse board is also dry, so we are still trying to determine where the water is coming from. “We are continuing to work with Chantal to find the cause of the problem, with our housing management and repairs teams having visited again early this week and we are committed to resolving the problem at the earliest opportunity.

In the footage Dean can be seen trying to act as peacemaker to defuse an altercation between his cousin Taylor Lock and another man outside the pub.The CCTV shows the moment that -year-old Silllence threw the “forceful, swinging punch” from behind, knocking Dean backwards without warning. He went on to assault Mr Lock.  Boxing enthusiast Sillence, from Bangor, was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to  years in prison in December . He also admitted to assault causing actual bodily harm on Mr Lock. Deanaposs family took the incredibly dficult decision to share the moment Dean was killed as they step up their campaign for tougher sentences for single-punch killers. They have launched a petition, signed by more than ,, calling on the UK Government to change the sentencing for one-punch assaults so that it matches that for murder convictions.Deans’ mum, Becky explained why she shared the footage on Facebook : “I wanted to put it out there that when my son was killed there was no fight or words exchanged between Dean and Brandon.He was in fact trying to prevent a fight breaking out between his cousin and a friend of Sillence, she added.  “You can clearly see by the video that the police have released, that Brandon aposCowardapos Sillence punched my son from behind. “Dean couldn’t even see it coming, it killed him instantly because he hit him that hard and forcefully. “What sort of coward hits someone from behind and leaves him on the floor, then walks away knowing the damage he had done. She added: “How is this not an intentional act of violence to cause harm  To all that defended Brandon by saying it was a pub fight shame on all of you. “My son and nephew were attacked by this coward, Brandon.“As the judge said he was willing to punch his own shadow that night which resulted in my sonaposs death, and affected our family lives forever” Sillence was jailed a few days after the jury found him not guilty of murder but the court case and sentence was a huge disappointment to the family.

The snap could be spotted in pictures released yesterday that showed her holding an in-person audience with military officials at Windsor Castle.The audience took place in the castleaposs Oak Room, Her Majestyaposs private sitting room, and the lovely framed photo could be seen on a table behind her. Itaposs unclear where exactly the photo was taken - but it appears to have been at her Scottish Highlands retreat of Balmoral. In it, the Queen can be seen sitting on a sofa surrounded by nine of her younger relatives. Standing behind the sofa and posing for the camera appears to be her granddaughter, Lady Louise Windsor, beside her great-grandchildren Prince George, Isla Phillips, Princess Charlotte and Savannah Phillips. Meanwhile sitting beside her on the sofa appear to be Prince Louis, Mia Tindall and Lena Tindall. Therefore itaposs likely the baby she is cradling on her knee is Lucas Tindall, who was born last March. Missing from the snap are the Queenaposs other great-grandchildren - Prince Harryaposs children Archie, Lilibet, August Brooksbank and Sienna Mapelli Mozzi. Another lovely picture also framed on the table shows the Queen and the late Prince Philip with their great-grandchildren at Balmoral in .

It was taken by the Duchess of Cambridge and released by the Royal Family following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh in April.An extra-large Fortnum  Mason Milk  Dark Chocolate Selection Box, and a box of Bendicks Mint Collection – an assortment of dark mint chocolates - was also spotted on the same table.Meanwhile, during yesterdayaposs audience, where the Queen met with the incoming Defence Services Secretary Major General Eldon Millar and his predecessor Rear Admiral James Macleod, she admitted she was having trouble moving.  In footage of her audience, the monarch can be heard remarking loudly: “Oh. I’m here! I thought you might have just stayed in there for ages. Good morning.” Asked how she is, the smiling Queen, wearing a floral dress and holding a walking stick, points to her left leg or foot and responds: “Well as you can see I can’t move.” She is understood to have been feeling slightly stf, rather than having injured herself or being unwell. Later in the footage, Rear Admiral James Macleod remarks: “Well, many congratulations on the start of your Jubilee year”, with the Queen saying: “Oh thank you very much indeed.” Major General Eldon Millar adds: “She gave a little growl as we came in.” The Queen replies: “Oh really …she doesn’t normally growl.” Rear Admiral Macleod replies: “She obviously can see through us.”Yesterdayaposs audience was also the Queenaposs first in-person appearance since her Covid scare a week ago, suggesting she may have escaped the virus despite coming into contact with Prince Charles, who tested positive two days later.Buckingham Palace declined to comment.

With his lawyers’ help he came across as a debauched, entitled social reactionary from the world of th century princelings that America cast off in . Andrew seemed to believe his rank made him unaccountable. And the aggression of his defence team in the New York civil action brought by Virginia Giuffre made it much worse. There was also a feeling in America that Andrew had already been judged in another court: The one convened by his own family.  Their draconian steps to strip him of his titles and banish him from public duties may not be trial by jury but it rang out clearly as an unequivocal condemnation by those who know him best. That does not, however, pacy federal prosecutors. They still want Andrew’s help in shedding light on the world of sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. By his own admission, Andrew had known and regularly met Epstein for two decades. In  the New York-based federal prosecutor, Geoffrey Berman, said Andrew “sought to ly portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate” in his investigation but had repeatedly declined to be interviewed. That was bad enough. But when Andrew’s legal team painted Virginia Giuffre as someone compromised by “her own wrongful conduct” rather than as one of the many victims of the depraved Epstein Ghislaine Maxwell menage, it reinforced a certain view of Andrew: That he was incapable of feeling any remorse for believing that he could circulate in that world without being tarnished by it.The Last Queen by Clive Irving is published in paperback by Biteback on Thursday, £..Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Ghislaine MaxwellPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal FamilyCourt caseCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The investigation emerged amid calls for transparency about Prince Andrew’s £million civil sex case settlement. The Mirror can reveal the Queen helped Prince Andrew settle the claim by making a £million donation to his sex abuse accuser’s charity. But ­questions were still being asked about whether public money was used. Her Majesty was today seen for the first time since her Covid scare last week, at an engagement at Windsor Castle. Standing with a walking stick, she pointed to her left leg or foot, and said: “Well, as you can see, I can’t move.” Tonight a source close to Charles confirmed the future king is willing to speak to police to help the investigation. They said: “There has been no request for help from the police so far, buthe is asked to help he will of course do so.” The allegations centre around ­businessman Mr Mahfouz donating £.million to restoration projects of particular interest to Prince Charles.  Mr Fawcett, who has since quit as chief executive of Charles’s charity, is alleged to have negotiated with fixers to secure a CBE for the Saudi who was said to be seeking recognition and residency in the UK infor financial contributions to The Prince’s Foundation. Prince Harry met Mr Mahfouz in  and was pictured shaking hands with the billionaire who donated £, to his charity.In December, the Sunday Times revealed that the pair met at a pub in Cha, West London, owned by Mark “Marko” Dyer, a former royal equerry known as Harry’s “second father”, who is said to have brokered the introduction in . They reportedly discussed Sentebale, a charity Harry set up after a gap year in Lesotho, Southern Africa. In response to the report, the Duke of Sussex issued a rare statement saying he had severed his ties with Mr Mahfouz. A spokeswoman for Prince Harry said: “The Duke and his advisers, as well as his nonprofit Sentebale, severed ties with Mr Mahfouz and his associates in , no longer accepting further donations to Sentebale and discontinuing any plans for a fundraising event amid growing concerns over his motives. “The Duke had one planned meeting with this donor nearly eight years ago, did not introduce him to any members of the Royal Family, and expressed concerns about the donor.”  Harry did not say what he believed Mahfouz’s motives were, or specy whether he shared his “concerns” with Charles or Clarence House. Despite the denials, former Met detective sergeant Steve Morris said: “Both Prince Charles and Prince Harry should be questioned without a doubt. “It is all part of the investigation, how the donor got to where he is within the charity, that is vital evidence to show the picture of how he has allegedly infiltrated the charity. “They should both be spoken to at the very least as witnesses. It would involve officers going to their address, or them being invited to a police station to give what’s called a Section  statement, purely as a witness at this moment in time.” Charles is president of the foundation but thought not to be involved with its governance or with trustees overseeing its day-to-day activities. A Clarence House spokesman said: “The Prince of Wales had no knowledge of the alleged offer of honours or British citizenship on the basis of donation to his charities.” Prince Harry could not be reached for comment. The Met is understood to have arranged an investigating team after pressure group Republic contacted Scotland Yard last September and reported Charles and Mr Fawcett on suspicion of breaching the HonoursAct . At the time Clarence House said the Prince had “no knowledge” of the alleged cash-for-honours scandal.Former BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt tweeted: “This has the potential to be very challenging for Prince Charles. For decades, Michael Fawcett was one of his most powerful confidants.“If their investigation is to be ­credible, the Met police will have to interview the future king in the same way they would any other citizen.”  Mr Mahfouz has previously denied the allegations. Scotland Yard confirmed a probe is under way, saying: “The decision follows an assessment of a September  letter. This related to media reporting alleging offers of help were made to secure honours and citizenship for a Saudi national. The Special Enquiry Team has conducted the assessment process which has included contacting those believed to hold relevant information. “Officers liaised with The Prince’s Foundation about the findings of an independent investigation into fundraising ­practices. The foundation provided a number of relevant documents. “These were reviewed alongside existing information. The assessment determined an investigation will commence. There have been no arrests or interviews under caution.” Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince HarryPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkPrince Charles, Prince of WalesBBCBuckingham PalaceScotland Yardpolitan PoliceCharitiesRoyal FamilyBillionairesDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The mum from Durham didn’t let her stop that though and took things into her own hands.She documented her efforts on a Facebook group ‘DIY On a Budget UK’, it was reported on LatestDeals. She said: I painted my kitchen in the first lockdown with a dark grey paint as I had seen other people do this but I loved the shaker style kitchens. I just followed lots of home accounts and saw dferent people doing similar things.We had quotes a while back and it ied but it would have been something like £, to replace the kitchen and I couldn’t justy that kind of money when I knew I could update the plain doors to a shaker style myself.” After using MDF, a medium weight fibreboard, in her bedroom for ling as well as on her staircase and hallway, Jill was already self-taught. She continued: I was desperate to do my kitchen and after doing the hall I knew I could do my kitchen. So I contacted a local timber merchant and asked them to cut a sheet of MDF into mm strips, which meant it would cover all the old holes where the handles had been. I chose mm deep as I tried dferent depths of MDF and any thicker it would have caught on the door next to it.”  She cut eachwith a manual saw and asked her local timber merchant to cut a sheet of MDF into mm strips. Jill said: “ I did three light coats with a sponge roller. I used the Valspar v eggshell paint for wood and metal. “It was colour matched to Farrow and Ball Purbeck stone.” She then drilled holes for the doorknobs and replaced the door hinges with soft close hinges so they don’t bang when they close.Jill uploaded the upcycled kitche to her Instagram account which has received more than , views. She concluded: It cost me £ for the MDF, about £ for the primer and eggshell paint and about £ for the new handles and a couple of pounds each for the caulk and adhesive. I have friends who paid about £, at least to have their kitchens professionally painted and that didn’t include changing them with the MDF. People are frightened to try so my advice would be to try painting a little piece of furniture first to get used to painting oryou have a spare kitchen cupboard stuck in the loft then have a little practice on that. “Obviously saving the money is a huge benefit and that means I have that money to spend somewhere .” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Kitchen\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Brian Morrison, from Glasgow, Scotland, filmed the bulbous formation, which is known as Mammatus. The cloud formation is a rare and spectacular phenomenon which is the result of a process best described as reverse direction conviction.The clouds are an indicator of severe weather conditions.During a thunderstorm, warm moist updrafts rise to the top of the troposphere where the temperatures level off, creating the pendulous clouds. Brian filmed the video at around :pm yesterday in his hometown. Storm Dudley battered the country yesterday as strong winds and rain ripped trees from their roots and power outages in parts of the country. Winds speeds of up to mph were recorded in parts of the country with an Amber alert issued by the Met Office until midnight.As the clouds appeared, one local joked: Oh my God. Giant jellyfish aliens...Run! Another onlooker, Jen Edwards, said the clouds were “really cool to see, but also a bit creepy.  Another said: Ah man you were lucky to see those, I am slightly jealous. They often occur when thunderclouds form. Sue Smith joked: Sky dumplings. Storm Dudley saw ferocious winds of up to mph strike, as many were left without power in the worst affected regions as an amber weather warning was issued. This morning, yellow wind and ice warnings remain in place from the northern tip of Scotland to as far south as Birmingham.From Friday, Storm Eunice is predicted to batter the south and an amber weather warning is in place for the region, along with yellow warnings further north for wind and snow.There have been stark warnings that it could be one of the worst tempests in  years, with winds of up to mph possible in parts of the UK.

Christine Price had hoped a three-bed property in Stoke-on-Trent would be the perfect home as the young couple prepare to welcome a baby. But luckily the -year-old, who already has  grandchildren, realised something was fishy when she was asked for a £, aposdepositapos to be transferred upfront. It transpired the conwoman did not own the house in question at all.The fraud came about after mum-of-five Christine innocently posted on a Stoke-on-Trent Facebook page askinganyone knew of somewhere suitable.Stoke on Trent Live reports that she then received a message from a woman called claiming to be called Linda who said she had a house to let.aposLindaapos told Christine she lived in Canterbury and due to her aposbitter experienceapos of cancelled viewings she asked for the cash up front as security. She added thatthe house was not suitable, the money would be refunded in full.  Her ruse was rumbled when Christineaposs husband went to look at the property from the outside and noticed an estate agentaposs board. After calling the estate agentaposs Northwood, they confirmed they had never heard of aposLindaapos and the house already had a tenant. Warning others to be on their guard, Christine said: My bloodaposs boiling as so nearly got scammed. Iaposve been looking for a house for my son and his missus as theyaposre having a baby and want to live together. Theyaposve been saving for ages. Iaposd put a post on the Facebook page explaining what we were after.This woman claiming to be a landlady messaged me. At first I thought nothing was wrong but something told me in my gut that it wasnapost right. My hubby went to view the property from the outside and then called the estate agent whose board was still up. It turned out that they already had someone living there. The estate agent asked me the name of the supposed landlady and it wasnapost right. It was clearly a scam. When I called Linda out, she just told me I must have been at the wrong house and even said I wasnapost allowed to view her property without her there. Itaposs not against the law to suss a house out from the outside. The estate agent has been really good and got in touch with the real landlady. I also reported Linda on the Facebook page. She was expecting a deposit of £, which she probably would have gotI didnapost dig a bit deeper. This woman should be ashamed of herself. I just want to let other people looking to rent know that these scammers are out there andsomething doesnapost seem right, it probably isnapost. My son and his girlfriend had been saving for a long time to get the deposit together and they could have been back to square oneI hadnapost questioned it. A spokesperson for Northwoodaposs Stoke office urged prospective tenants to go through estate agents. They said: We are sorry to hear that the family almost fell victim to a scam, but are relieved to know that it was found out before any harm was done. The property in question had already been rented out, legitimately, by this office and our best advice to anyone looking to rent is to be extremely careful when using social media s and ideally always seek the guidance of a fully registered and accredited lettings agent such as Northwood to help you through the process.

According to the Manchester Evening News, one woman on Facebook said the cards were a great idea, and praised the supermarket for making braille cards - which are usually available from the Royal National Institute of Blind Peoplewebsite - more easily accessible.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Karen Davison wrote: What a great idea! Do they have braille birthday cards  I have a friend who is blind and this would be amazing. I know you can buy from RNIB online, but just asking. While Steph Laban loved the inclusive range, as she said: Love this. My daughter is fully blind and although she is only  at the moment, I love that she can now enjoy cards the way we do.There was also heaps of praise from Twitter users, including Simon Doherty who said Tescoaposs display was the first time heaposd ever seen braille cards.He noted: Fair play to Tesco, Iaposve never seen braille cards before.  Others called the push to sell accessible braille cards an amazing initiative, and said itaposs something that should have hit shelves years ago. The RNIB confirmed the range of cards the weekend before Valentineaposs Day, where they said they had teamed up with Tesco and Hallmark to design the cards with ied sensory features. They tweeted at the time: With Valentine’s Day just around the corner, @Tesco has worked with us to launch a range of cards for people with sight loss. The cards, created by @Hallmark, have ied sensory features on them, including dferent feel, texture and pattern work in addition to braille. The braille cards are part of Tescoaposs continued commitment to offering a more inclusive card selection across its stores. Stephanie Burrows, Tescoaposs assistant buyer for cards, said: “At Tesco, our customers are at the heart of everything we do, so it’s important we make a continued effort to build an inclusive and accessible product range to meet their needs. We’re always listening to feedback and know cards are an area where more ersity and inclusiveness is desperately needed for better representation of us all. We’ve recently been adding more LGBTQIA+, disability and ethnicity cards across many of our card ranges, and we’re delighted to share them with our customers and look forward to hearing their feedback.”Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TescoValentines DaySupermarketsFeel-good news\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Just when The Firm thought they had buried one of the most shameful and humiliating periods in its recent history, the Queen has been dealt another hammer blow. Scotland Yard launching a criminal probe into an alleged cash for honours scandal at the heart of one of Prince Charles’s charities is not just another extraordinary development in exceptional times. It may call into question the very fabric of those operating at the heart of the monarchy.  Once again, as she has done many times before in times of trouble, the Queen today summoned the strength to put on a brave face and put duty first. But one could not fail to be moved by her admission, walking stick in hand, that she was unable to move as she would wish while a dignitary was wheeled out for a photo-op at her Windsor home. Just as she should be preparing to revel in the glory of her remarkable  years on the throne, it seems as though events are imploding around her. The family had hoped the shame of Prince Andrew’s involvement with two convicted sex offenders would be finalised ahead of Her Majesty’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations this year. But questions will surely remain over the Queen’s judgment in helping her son make such a settlement to his sex abuse accuser, which largely remains shrouded in secrecy. All of this against a backdrop of another potential scandal, which may see her son Charles and grandson Prince Harry quizzed by police, albeit as witnesses in the first instance. If ever there was a time to unite and collectively take the strain, now is that time for the family. Whether they are too fractured to do so is a story to be continued.

The small balls of tar were discovered on the coastline of seaside town Blackpool, Lancashire, sparking a major clean up operation. Their discovery comes after roughly  barrels of crude oil escaped from a pipe off the coast of North Wales, which supplies fuel to the Isle of Man. People have been urged not to touch the balls or attempt to remove them from the beach while clean up teams from oil firm ENI UK are sent in. A spokesman for the firm said: The clean-up teams are onsite and working closely with the local authorities and coastguard.  Pictures of the iconic beach have shown the small black balls strewn across the sand between the townaposs North and Central Piers. The burst pipe, which runs between two s named Conwy and Douglas, was shut off following the leak on Monday and remains closed. The coin-size pieces of tar are made up of a mixture of hydrocarbons and form when crude oil deposits are weathered after floating in the ocean. The local council said Storm Dudley is likely to see more balls wash up on the shore and has urged people not to touch or try to remove any of the balls. A spokesman for Blackpool Council said: Due to tidal conditions and a forecast of extreme weather conditions over the next few days, there is a possibility of more washing up.Our beaches will mostly be chained off due to high tides and storm force winds during this time, and we ask that people avoid these stretches to avoid any contact. Eni UK processes crude oil to produce fuels, lubricants and chemical products and is involved with offshore drilling in the UK.

Nadia met her ex-husband through a dating app a year after moving. Nadia said she married who she thought was a “really amazing person” before she endured emotional and psychological abuse. Nadia told The Mirror: “I felt like I had found my person, we learned we had a lot of shared interests and had loads to talk about. We liked the same things. I fell into the relationship quite quickly and it felt so easy.  “We went on dates, I met some of his friends, and the people he worked with. There was no sort of red flags that started jumping out. We started living together after dating for two years and it was then that I started to see his behaviour change.” Nadia claims he coerced her into sex and allegedly convinced her she had mental health problems, causing her to spiral into a severe depression. Nadia said: “I had convinced myself that because he didn’t hit me or shove me or physically assault me that it wasn’t abuse. I didn’t know what he was doing was abusive and I later learned there are other kinds of abuse and manipulation. “He convinced me I was mentally ill and thatI had any issue with him or his actions he would put it back on me and that it was my fault.” She claims it took a while to recognise what was happening to her because things began to change at the start of the first lockdown - which is when everyone was more isolated than before. Nadia said: “While we were living together, I hadn’t realised it at the time but I was slowly becoming more and more isolated. It was sticky because this was the start of the pandemic so everyone was a little isolated and I just chalked it up to lockdown. “There was initially sexual abuse where he made me perform sexual acts without my consent and we had a conversation about it and it didn’t happen again in that explicit way.  “That became a problem in our relationship because he convinced me the problem was me and he guilted me, saying ‘ you love someone why wouldn’t you want to be intimate with them’. “I felt pressured to have sex and to be physically intimate with him and that had an impact on my emotional wellbeing. I became more anxious.” Nadia claims her ex would “emotionally punish her” by cutting off contact and disappearing for days on end. She said: “It felt like he was doing this to make me feel like I’ve done something wrong and then I would be the one to apologise and I would be worried to seehe’s okay. During one of his disappearances, Nadia says she contacted police and when they showed up they said they reportedly said they couldn’t determine a crime was committed. She said: “The questions were limited and there wasn’t room for me to explain how he used other forms of control that weren’t just ‘you can or cannot do this’. “The police officer said he didn’t have a choice but to not classy it as a crime and it just never went forward.” She added: “We started couples counselling because I thought there was a communication issue and I thought what was happening was normal and other couples were going through this.”  When the counselling didn’t help, Nadia says her mental health plummeted and she started to contemplate taking her own le. She said: “During one of his phases of disappearing he left me alone at home and I didn’t know where he went and I couldn’t contact him for days and that made me very anxious. “We had a lot of arguments once he got back in touch with me and then I just broke. I started spiralling and I was already severely depressed, it was quickly going from arguing to planning my suicide. “I think I knew I wasn’t going to go through with it because I reached out to my therapist. During that therapist intervention he said to me ‘I think you are in an abusive relationship’ and it took someone using that term with me to snap me out of it.” Nadia was able to leave the abusive household with the support of local services and that is where she learned about the SET. The SET is a pathway to remain in the country for iniduals who are currently living in the UK under a spousal visa but have to leave the relationship because of domestic violence.If you or anyone you know is experiencing domestic abuse, reach out for support – Womenaposs Aid’s live chat can be accessed  days a week via chat.womensaid.org.uk If the application is successful, the inidual will have indefinite leave to remain in the UK. If unsuccessful, the inidual must leave the country. There is no appeal process for this application. The moment Nadia left the relationship she violated her spousal visa, meaning she had to noty the Home Office explaining that she intended to apply for the SET. Nadia does not qualy for legal aid and her friend has set up a crowdfunding page to cover the £, costs of the y process. Nadia said: “The actual process is very dficult not just because of how much goes into the application because it requires me to find evidence for the abuse. That has been hard because I’m still coming to terms with the abuse and still trying to know what was the abuse.  “It is a financial burden, which is why we are raising money because the case is incredibly expensive to apply for the SET. “I needed to hire a lawyer and needed to pay for the additional psychological assessments. There is also the time it takes to liaise with the GP and medical professionals. It has been very exhausting both financially and emotionally. “By submitting the application I am telling the Home Office that I am no longer married and I am losing my spousal visa. If I am rejected I am no longer allowed to stay here. I’ve been told I could be given  days to leave but even in a situation where I’m mentally well that is just not enough time to relocate and reconfigure my entire le.” Nadia started collecting evidence and documentation for the application in summer  and officially submitted it to the Home Office with her legal team later in the year.One of the services that explained the legal process to Nadia was SouthallBlackSisters, a not-for-profit organisation that provides support to black and minority women experiencing violence and abuse.Shakila Taranum Maan, an Advocacy Services Manager at SBS, said: “We’ve been involved in a campaign for many years in terms of getting women who are spouses who come to the UK and are victims of abuse, and for the government to recognise that what has happened is not their fault. “If this provision wasn’t in place I think these women would have such an injustice in terms of representation. She added: “If the provision didn’t exist for those women, you would have to ask yourself what kind of justice system do you have. “We have rules and regulations in terms of domestic violence and they should be afforded the same support as UK nationals. “Women may not be aware that they can make an application and it’s really about getting that knowledge out there to women and victims of abuse so they can access that provision.” Nadia has been told it could take the Home Office up to a year to make a decision, and in her case, because the abuse was not physical it could be more dficult to determine. Simran Kaur, a Domestic Violence and Abuse Specialist Practitioner with the No Woman Turned Away project at Women’s Aid, said that abuse can be invisible, but doesn’t make it any less severe.She said: “It’s what people think of as abuse and what people see as abuse is still very much the problem, and there is this reliance on some sort of physical injury. “I think that belief stems fromyou don’t see it then it hasn’t happened. “What we often see is that survivors have struggled to come to terms with the emotional and psychological abuse themselves. Simran added: “That is why we have a lot of women approach our online chat and say ‘I think my partner might be abusive’. Simran said one way Women’s Aid supports women who face barriers to leaving - which can include a disability or immigration status - is through the No Woman Turned Away project. The project provides additional help to victimsapos local services so victims can be supported. Simran added: “It can take multiple attempts to leave and many women will come to us and say they tried but they donapost think they can. “Women need to know that evenone attempt fails that doesn’t mean your support ends there. “If a plan fails they might decide to try again later and we always encourage them to come back.

However, there are others out there who are a little bit more decadent with their water consumption. Ryan Dubs, who works as a Creative Director, spends more on bottled water in a year than many will spend on wine in their entire letime, splurging ,per month on bottled water. With four fridges in his kitchen, Ryan has plenty of room for his monthly luxury and finds loading the bottles onto his shelves to be a very satisfying activity.Ryanaposs aqua tipple of choice is VOSS, a high-end water brand that prides itself on having one of the purest bottled waters of anywhere on Earth.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.

I can only drink bottled water, itaposs the only way Iaposll get it in me. Previously, Ryan would get equally enormous quantities of Fiji water delivered, but began to feel conscious about how much plastic waste he was creating, and wanted to try a more eco-friendly choice. Ryan explained: Voss is net carbon neutral so itaposs definitely a more eco-friendly choice. And yeah, itaposs a little pricey but I do buy it in bulk from the same type of place that would sell it to a hotel or a grocery store, so itaposs a bit better. Despite the staggering cost, Ryan appears to have no regrets about his spending.

However, as pleasant as that may be, many of those in the comments section have been left aghast at the extravagance of the monthly purchase, believing no water could possibly be that refreshing. Remarking on the privilege of having access to clean water in the first place, one person commented: People donapost have clean water or any water at all, and this guy out here saying, aposI hate the taste of tap water, I canapost get it in meapos.

Amber Satriani says she and her -year-old pal went to The Glass House in St Helens and everything was going well until their drinks were taken away.The pair ordered drinks via the Wetherspoons app and were asked to show their IDs when a staff member brought them to the table. As reported by The Liverpool Echo, the employee is said to have then requested to scan Amberaposs friendaposs licence and went off to do so.However,  minutes later the siteaposs manager appeared, picked up the drinks and refused to serve them alcohol. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Amber recalled The manager said she couldnapost serve us because she had a gut feeling [my friendaposs ID] was a fake because something had gone wrong with the scan. She didn’t even bother to scan my ID and instead just took both our drinks and said Iaposd be refunded through the app. After a few minutes I went up to the bar and askedI could scan my ID to seethere was something wrong because obviously, we’d have to contact the DVLAour cards were playing up, to which mine scanned completely fine. Amber went on to say how they discovered her friendaposs ID wouldnapost scan due to residue on the card and once removed it scanned without problem, however, the manager still refused the two women service.  She added: We even showed our bank cards to show the names matched and had completely run out of any ideas how we could further prove our age. Even after all of that the manager still refused us service.Amber posted about the incident on Facebook and asked whether anyone  had experienced a similar problem at the pub.Many people claimed to have had similar issues according to the comments. One woman replied: Same thing happened to me. Reason given was that my ID hair was pink and mineaposs now black so it was fake. Another wrote: They told me my licence wasn’t me and I was using someone ’s card when I showed my name matched and made go to get my passport. A third posted: This happened to my daughter and her friends. I wouldn’t mind, they had been drinking there for two hours and then all of a sudden they refused to give them their drinks, even though they had paid for them. They haven’t been back since. In response to the claims, a spokesperson for Wetherspoons said: It is a legal requirement for all licensed premises to prevent the sale and consumption of alcohol by anyone under the age of  years old. Unfortunately, fake IDs are readily available over the internet which means that our employees, when checking a customer’s proof of age, have to be extremely vigilant and exercise a degree of discretion as to whether IDs presented to them are valid or not. Iniably this means that on occasion, customers who do present valid IDs will be refused service.

This has been a complete shock for our community, said Dylan Parker, the mayor of Randwick Council which includes Little Bay. Our coastline is our back yard and to have a tragic death under such horrying circumstances is completely shocking. Local fishermen and beachgoers watched on helplessly as the predator mauled the victim to death. One witness told how they witnessed the shark swallow parts of his body after ripping what they believe to be a man in two. In the footage, those who heard the heartbreaking screams can be seen reacting to the devastating attack.  The attack comes days before the Murray Rose Malabar Magic Ocean Swim, an annual charity event usually attended by thousands of swimmers at a neighbouring beach. Organisers said they were monitoring the situation andthe event had to be postponed it would be held on March . A spokesperson for the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries said its shark biologists believe that a white shark at least  metresinwas likely responsible for the attack. It was the first fatal shark attack in Sydney since , data showed. Authorities have ordered people to remain out of the water on a hot summer day as temperatures hovered around C. A few crazy surfers still go out and take the risk but most of us take notice and just stay out of the water until the sharks have gone. Itaposs a lot more dangerous driving to be quite honest, said local resident Karen Romalis.

Amongst these is Beinn Odhar # its southern slopes lying firmly in the county of Stirling, whilst its summit stands proudly in Argyll.If approached from the west, north or south you could keep your toes in Argyll all day. Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN. Either way you will tend to end up on sections of the old mining path as it zigs zags upwards by default due to the natural line of the slope.Once you reach m # after approximately .km depending on how direct your route was # the ground becomes stonier. The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look. The bottom of the adit starts at around ms.Heading up from the adit and mine # or path # the route flattens out, passing a lochan and the county boundary to your left. Ahead, the final ascent is best tackled by heading northeast then northwest to follow the hill’s natural line. There are no particular dficulties.The summit views are fabulous and an excellent panorama of Beinn Dorain can be had from the steep northern slopes above Coire Luaidh.It is easiest todown the southwestern slopes you ascended, but other possibilities could include some of the neighbouring Corbetts, especially the longer days in summer.Safety in the outdoorsThe described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print,  please be aware track and path closures can happen at any time.

Before joining farming, I had no idea the community was so heavily impacted by bad mental health.#If one person reads about Mind Your Head and decides to reach out or to check in on a loved one, that’s a step in the right direction.#Please, be that person and start the conversation. You never know how much it could mean to someone struggling silently.#For more information on the Mind Your Head campaign visit www.yellowwellies.org or follow @yellowwelliesUK on social media using the hashtag #MindYourHead."},{"url":null,"title":"argyll seafood showcased at dubai expo","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

And the Bonnyrigg player was lucky to escape further punishment when he demonstrated his frustration by booting a stray ball over the fence into the adjacent field.Gala continued to dominate in the second-half and player manager Scott came on for his first appearance since taking over from Neil Hastings.And with his first-touch the former Hibs’ player  set up Murray who scored with a superb low angled drive..removeScott then tried his luck with a long-range effort from the half-way line but the keeper got back to save his shot.He then demonstrated his skills on the right wing before firing a low cross into the danger area but there were no takers.With time running out Rose were awarded a penalty, but Kit McRitchie produced a fine ing save to deny Curie and Rovers held on for a well-deserved - victory.Scott told us: “Before the game we told the players that we believe in them.“And we set our stamp on the game early-doors with a goal in the sixth minute and another in the th minute. Normally we have been conceding at these times of late. But to get the first goal then go on to have a dominant performance for the -minutes was very pleasing.“They had a - minute spell of pressure after the sending off but we got a foothold back in the game and it was comfortable in the end.“It’s been a learning curve and myself and Stevieare learning about the team and how they react in dferent situations and how we manage situations going forward.”Craig praised the contribution of Scott and told us. ”He’s hardly trained in three months due to a thigh and a calf problem. I’ve been trying to encourage him and told him that he was capable of playing and managing at Lowland League level. He’s got too much to offer on the pitch just now.

firm to claim three precious league points.A healthy crowd of almost  turned out in dreadful conditions, with gusts topping  miles per hour and intermittent sheets of freezing rain greeting those spectators who arrived to support the team.Refreshingly, though, a group of youngsters were amongst the entourage travelling with the north Glasgow visitors, and they soon felt at home, happily mixing with the Pupils# own young supporters and joining in song.First, an attempted Pupils clearance found its way to Finnart#s number , who kept his composure to slot home a close-range finish and make it two goals in two games against the Pupils.Then, a header from a swirling cross from Finnart#s left-hand side couldn#t be kept out, despite the efforts of Alasdair Ferguson in goal.The Pupils# Rhys Casci did go close with a one-on-one effort in the first half after being freed by a low pass from midfield, but the Tarbert-based player opted to shoot early and the keeper got his body in front of the effort and gathered at the second attempt.After the interval, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils hoped to use the westerly tailwind to put pressure on the visitors# goal, but it was a quieter half than the hosts would have liked.Finnart battled to repel the Pupils, limiting them to two dangerous efforts from outside the box, first from Casci who forced a save from the away keeper to tip his low shot round the post for a corner, and then from Scott Souden whose deflected effort forced the keeper into a save.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils made some changes late on with youngster Andrew Renton and right-back Michael McKinlay making afrom injury, but it wasn’t enough to turn the tide of the game and the visitors took all three points, to leave themselves two points behind leaders Kilsyth Athletic with two games in hand.Conversely, the Pupils are three points adrt at the foot of the ision, but importantly have two games in hand themselves.In the aftermath of the game, the Pupils# management team stated they were satisfied with the effort and performance level of the squad, acknowledging that the dference between the sides on the day, despite the polar dference in league positions, was the conversion of chances.This is something which Finnart has made an art form of in winning games against sides around them who perhaps play more expansive football.Sure enough,

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks. You can also sow outdoors, but use cloches or small poly tunnels until next month when the soil has warmed up. They will also provide your lettuce seedlings with protection from birds and slugs.Good ieties to start now include cut-and-come again Salad Bowl – oak leaved, high yield with green and red ieties a

the driving force of the airline between  and  Loganair#s dedicated team of staff throughout the last six decades and the unwavering commitment of our owners, Stephen and Peter Bond, who have now been involved with the airline for over  years.#We#re delighted to announce a major expansion of our partnership with British Airways, effectively doubling the number of routes on which we co-operate to bring benefits for customers.#The development cements what we believe to be the longest-running relationship between two UK airlines, and it#s a partnership which will continue to deliver for customers throughout the UK.#The next  years will undoubtedly see a dferent set of challenges, yet I#m already hugely encouraged by progress to develop new carbon-neutral electrical and hydrogen power

Loganair customers to the destination within the first six of our next  years.#First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: #For six decades now, Loganair, the oldest name in UK airlines, has made an exceptional contribution to the Scottish economy.#Since , the airline has helped keep the country moving, ensuring that people across Scotland are connected – particularly those living in and visiting

avoiding fines.Councillor John McMillan, East Lothian Council transport spokesperson, said: “For those who don’t have a safe place to park and charge at home, seeing live, on-street status in their

This isn’t a natural climate disaster but one largely of political making.“Action should be taken by both the UK and Scottish Governments to protect the poorest and mitigate hardship for all. Windfall taxes, VAT reduction and direct payments to the poorest and most threatened households are required. It confirms why Scotland must be in charge of its own energy policy and the natural wealth of its shores.”  Frazer Scott, CEO of Energy Action Scotland, said of the rise: “The energy price rises announced this month are absolutely devastating for households across Scotland.“It impacts most on those households in the lowest incomes, who spend a signicantly higher proportion of their incomes to heat and power their homes – or indeed simply cannot heat and power their homes to the comfort levels that maintain health and wellbeing.“These households will be unable to afford an adequate level of thermal comfort to maintain their health and wellbeing, and people will be forced to choose between heating and eating.“There are important short and long term priorities.“We are absolutely in a crisis and there needs to be a crisis response.“As it stands, the quantum of support provided by UK Government to Scottish Government is simply inadequate.“This payment appears to be better targeted to the households most in need compared to England but in Scotland this will provide little comfort to the , Scottish households in extreme fuel poverty, facing declining health and wellbeing, and excess deaths attributable to fuel poverty.”  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: “The East Lothian Poverty Plan adopted by the council in October  highlighted fuel poverty as a major and growing concern. It identied measures to be put in place to continue the work to combat fuel poverty and support people facing rising fuel costs.“The council has already increased its Scottish Welfare Fund budget by £, to increase support provided in crisis grants and a new Fuel Poverty Fund to help people in financial dficulty and facing hardship due to rising fuel costs.“We are aware that the predicted rise in fuel costs is a serious concern for East Lothian residents, so we will continue to monitor the situation and promote the financial advice and support available from the council and other agencies, including Changeworks, as well as working together with partners on any possible further interventions to support our residents.“This includes continuing our work to ensure that council homes are as energy efficient as possible while supporting landlords, tenants and homeowners to do the same by signposting to appropriate advice and support from partner agencies.“The new East Lothian Poverty Partnership set up by East Lothian Council is due to hold its first meeting next month, bringing together public sector agencies, voluntary organisations and community groups to combine efforts to

The recipe is for Dracula Salad and was her memorial to her late husband, Cruden Bay and his famous book.Also seen as an important Scottish link to the novel Dracula is the influence of Scottish writer Emily Gerard on Bram Stoker’s placing the plot in Transylvania.The Jedburgh-born author wrote a book about Transylvanian superstitions, which played a crucial role in Bram Stokers research when writing his classic novel.Scotlands capital also plays a part as the publishing house of Dracula was founded by Edinburgh bookseller and stationer Archibald Constable.Occultist and author JW Brodie-Innes, a leading member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawns Amen-Ra Temple in Edinburgh has been a personal friend.In his supernatural horror novel The Devils Mistress - first published in , three years after Bram Stoker died - he paid tribute to the Dracula author in a special dedication in his book.It says: \"To the memory of my dear friend, the author of Dracula, to whose help and encouragement I owe more than I am at present at liberty to state\".Dacre Stoker says he is now investigating what that \"more\" actually was.Sherlock Holmes author Arthur Conan Doyle, who was a spirtualist, also features in Bram Stoker story as a friend. He was at the Edinburgh authors marriage on  September .When Bram Stoker managed The Lyceum Theatre in London, he produced the Conan Doyle play A Story of Waterloo.In one letter Conan Doyle said that he had enjoyed reading Dracula adding: \"I think it is the very best story of Diablerie which I have read in many years.\"Dacre Stoker said: \"Both of these guys obviously were interested in the occult and Conan Doyle recognised that.\"Bram Stokers career as a theatre manager, also saw him heavily involved in the opening night of the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh in .The Glasgow connection comes as Bram Stoker got the job to support the staging of plays at the Theatre Royal.There is a theory that name of RM Renfield, the fictional character that is unquestionably loyal to the vampire in the Dracula novel, was taken from Glasgows Renfield Street.A Visit Scotland source said of the trail: \"It will be something we will work with Dacre on, to look at related sites for a potential trail and how accessible they are for visitors, for instance,they are open to the public, and what the visitor experience would beadded to a self guided trail.\"An Experience Transylvania spokeswoman added: \"The intentions of the Scottish trail are to follow all existing and relevant Dracula connections in the region, including of course Cruden Bay.\"The trail could also take in the Aberdeenshire former fishing village of Collieston, where a shipwreck of a th Century Spanish galleon is said to have provided the inspiration for Bram Stokers second novel, The Mystery of the Sea.Further around the coast at Whinnyfold, Bram Stoker wrote his book, Lair of the White Worm.The Aberdeenshire village of Gardenstown is where the author stayed in  and could have finished writing Dracula which was published a year later.Dacre Stoker said: “Scotland is where many chapters of the novel Dracula were actually written. It was during his long walks along the beach of Cruden Bay and on to Whinnyfold where all of Bram’s earlier inspiration, notes and research came together. This area offered him peace and quiet, a far cry from the interruptions and the stresses of his office in the Lyceum Theatre in London.\"Many ask how come we don’t celebrate in Transylvania, Whitby or Dublin. All these other locations do play a role in the origins of Dracula, of course, but when it comes to celebrating the literary process - the process of a writer bringing the story to le - I think Scotland, is a given”.Jenni Steele, film and creative industries manager for VisitScotland said of the th anniversary event: “This is a fantastic opportunity for people to learn about the Scottish connections to this well-loved novel. Dracula holds such a sense of intrigue and mystery, and it’s easy to see why Bram Stoker was inspired by some of Scotland’s magical landscapes and locations on his travels – not to mention the fascinating connections he had with many other Scottish writers and personalities.\""},{"url":null,"title":"letters-stand-russian-mafia-state","story":"Of course, it has already invaded the Crimea and Eastern Ukraine , which does not seem to trouble Mr Gillies.

He believes that the Russian people are inisible from the Ukrainian people, and indeed the Belarusian people, whose corrupt dictator Russia currently supports. Ultimately, he wishes to absorb Ukraine into Russia.This is what this crisis, manufactured by Mr Putin, is all about. That, and the fact that this dictator, in charge of a mafia state which is in effect a third world country armed to the teeth, cannot afford to have on his borders a free and democratic Ukraine , and which, particularlyit ever joins the European Union, is likely to become increasingly affluent.R Murray, Glasgow.* I DO not understand why Isobel Lindsayrefers to the entirely legal and greatly welcome presence of US and Nato forces in Europe in relation to the Russian military activity on the Ukraine border.Russia has already invaded Crimea and partially occupies Eastern Ukraine at the cost of many innocent lives, has been implicated in the breach of the EU border at Poland Belarus and was widely reported to have been party to the shooting-down of a passenger aircraft over Ukraine in . Vladimir Putin has been in power for about  years and his state apparatus has, most likely, poisoned and now imprisons the leader of his opposition. Would any of us wish to face the consequences of a US withdrawal from European involvement Having in recent history been invaded by Stalin, Hitler and again by Stalin and now, partially, by Putin, all at the cost of many innocent lives, Ukraine may well wish to seek international help to fend off Russias further attentions. It might satisfy Mr Putin in the short term for Ukraine to become a neutral state but Ukraine’s long-term peace and stability seems likely to be best served by Nato membership.Michael Sheridan, by Strachur, Argyll.NO CONCEALING THE TORY DAMAGEANDREW Dunlop writes that the \"Tories are doing more for Scotland than the SNP ever will\" . That explains why Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross wouldnt meet with Boris Johnson on his latest foray into \"North Britain\".The post-Brexit reality is grim and no amount of furious political spin can conceal it. Before leaving the world’s largest free trade bloc, exports accounted for a fth of Scottish GDP. In the year to June , exports had plunged % compared to . James Withers, head of Scottish Food and Drink, said many firms have simply “given up” on trading with EU companies because of the “tsunami” of red tape and said the worst is yet to come.As for replacing the annual £. billion Scotland lost from EU structural funds, a Westminster cross-party report said the UK Shared Prosperity Fund will fall short by %.The loss of free movement has cost thousands of jobs, particularly in the hospitality, care and road haulage sectors, and has resulted in price increases and widespread shortages.And because the UK Government rejected an offer of visa-free travel for touring musicians across the EU, Scottish artists can no longer afford to travel to and perform in Europe. The termination of the Erasmus scheme means thousands of Scottish students no longer have the chance to live and study in the EU.Mr Johnson says he is \"working very hard\" to unite people. In Scotland he is succeeding. He is uniting us against Westminster rule.Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh.SO WHERE IS THE OPPOSITION IT is becoming clear that unionism is a transmissible disease. What started with the shared opposition of Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats to the desire of the people of Scotland, expressed through more than a decade of electoral victories, for an independence referendum now extends to the other great issue of our times, namely our relationship with the European Union.Sir Keir Starmer has at last come off the fence, assuring voters in the north-east of England that there is no going back on Brexit , while Ed Davey has said that the Liberal Democrats, of all people, are not the party of rejoining the EU.An easy ride for the Conservatives, then, leaving us all to wonder what grounds the other national parties have for taking the money as Her Majesty’s Opposition at Holyrood or Westminster.James Scott, Edinburgh.STURGEON IS ALL ABOUT IMAGEI DON’T knowyou deliberately placed these two articles next to each other on Page  today, but it was interesting to note the headlines – “SNP ministers urged to act faster to mitigate £ real terms cut to Universal Credit” and “FM boosts global hub spending ahead of plans to hold IndyRef” .Take a moment to consider that we have a Scottish Government that is more interested in boosting its image abroad by spending an eye-watering £ million on overseas offices. This is a reserved matter and none of our taxes should be squandered in this way.While we have people in need of financial support due to the increase in the cost of food and energy, the SNP should not be wasting our money on such self-aggrandisement. The people who vote for Nicola Sturgeon should take note that she would rather further her own aims than help them pay their heating bills.Politics is all about choices and Ms Sturgeon’s choices are all about her image, not about caring for the less well-off.Jane Lax, Aberlour.THE TRUE SIZE OF GREEN SUPPORTMARK Smithstates that the Green Party attracted an \"execrable\" .% of the constituency vote at the  Scottish Parliament election. This is of course literally true, but as a representation of Green Party support is dishonest. Most voters didnt even have the opportunity to vote Green on their constituency vote and those who did knew that they had no chance of electing any Green MSP through this route. Its arguably remarkable under these circumstances that even .% of voters voted for them there.The real Green support is shown in the list vote, where everyone could vote for them and where votes are not wasted in the same way. There, they received more than eight per cent of the vote – still a minority, but considerably larger than Mr Smith represents.David Clinton, Hamilton.Read more: Johnson cannot escape the contempt of the people of Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-let-andrew-keep-titles----shows-nobility-no-better-rest","story":"This would facilitate perpetuation of the illusion that members of the titled classes are morally and socially superior to the rest of us.No thank you.Let him keep his titles and do not disguise or obscure the undeniable truth, well supported by history, that disreputable characters are no less likely to be found among nobility and royalty than among the untitled masses which I am proud to belong to.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.ROYALS CAN NOW REBUILDPRINCE Andrew has finally thrown in the towel and settled out of court, which rescues his mothers celebrations in her Platinum Jubilee from all the unsavoury revelations which could well have emerged from the court proceedings he claimed to be ready to face. Perhaps he could now devote himself to doing unsung charity work behind the scenes to atone for his errors of judgment while the task of restoring the somewhat tarnished reputation of the monarchy is left to Charles and Camilla along with William and Kate.No doubt after all this adverse publicity the royal family needs a boost to cement its standing in the eyes of the nation and to maintain its position of providing our head of state in keeping with the honourable tradition which brings pageantry and colour with its benefits to our nations tourist income.If the Queen now chose to abdicate at the conclusion of her Platinum Jubilee year, the door would be open to a fresh wave of what would assuredly be positive and good publicity to wash away the stain which has been haunting the institution of the monarchy for some years now.And Her Majesty, who has faithfully observed her duty to the country, could enjoy her well-deserved retirement, knowing that no one will ever be able to match her record as the longest-ever serving monarch.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.* I AM pleased Prince Andrews lawyers have agreed a pay-off over the civil case brought by Virginia Giuffre.

He tried to come out of this question with a good answer and he did it.”On being tipped for a future United role, Hasenhuttl continued: “This is not in my mind and also not the things that are interesting me.“I don’t want to speak about my future every week.“Last week we spoke about dferent things, and this week we should be speaking about the game we have now against Everton.“This is more interesting for me, my whole focus and whole energy is on this game. Anything  I will leave to other people.”Southampton will host Frank Lampard’s Everton at St Mary’s on Saturday, in the first of four home matches in their next five league and cup fixtures.Hasenhuttl feels confidence is high after beating Tottenham and taking points off both Manchester clubs, but has also warned his players not to let their guard down amid an apparent softer run of fixtures.“We are in a good moodyou want, we have had some tough games in the past weeks,” said Hasenhuttl.“We’ve lost only against Wolves and the rest was very tough, Manchester City, Tottenham, Manchester United.“Staying unbeaten was a massive step forward for us definitely. But that doesn’t mean that le is easier now, definitely not.“Teams are coming where you think points can be possible, but it’s definitely not easier.“We know the upcoming fixtures are super tough for us. But the level we have shown is the level we are demanding now. And we have to keep on going the way we have in the last few games.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645020787354.jpg--covid_19___wed_16th_february_figures.jpg?1645020787000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220216newscovid 19 wed 16th february figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows five further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBronagh Murray with her lawyer Brian ArcherAllan PrestonTwitterEmailFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA Co Down woman who won a religious and sexual discrimination case against the Ministry of Defencehas told of how months of insults by an Army captain left her dreading the thought of going to work.Bronagh Murray , a Catholic civilian worker who was stationed in Thiepval Barracks in Lisburn, is set to receive over £, in compensation after the decision of a Fair Employment Tribunal in Belfast this week. It is believed to be one of the largest awards of its kind, with the MoD also accepting liability.Read MoreCatholic woman who left job over alleged harassment by her Army boss to receive more than £, compensationSpeaking to the Belfast , Ms Murray said she was relieved at the decision and was now focused on rebuilding her le.I absolutely dreaded going to work even though I had an immaculate record as a civil servant since I was , she said.“At times I just couldn’t think straight. I thought I had a handle on it by ignoring him but I obviously didn’t. I kept thinking, ‘he’s getting the message, it just needs to stop’. I didn’t approach him at the time about the harassment because I felt I wouldn’t be believed and it would lead to more harassment because I didn’t find him funny.The harassment by the Army captain, who cannot be named for security reasons, took place over a five-month period in , with Ms Murray later retiring due to deteriorating psychiatric condition in .Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The tribunal heard that the captain repeatedly referenced her religion in front of others and had also referred to her as “the big cougar”.In one incident, he was reported to have said: “I need back up, I have an Irish Catholic girl armed and dangerous, come quick, need help.”During an office conversation about a concert, it’s also claimed that he said: “I bet you have tried to steal a cone, that is the Catholic coming out in you.”After starting the complaint process in September , the captain was eventually disciplined and transferred to another military posting.The tribunal awarded Ms Murray around £, to cover injury to feelings, psychiatric injuries, loss of previous earnings and interest. Not due to retire until , compensation for loss of future earnings was calculated in excess of £,.She added: “I’m just so relieved and pleased with the outcome. I feel great because I’m totally vindicated and at long last the truth has come out.”She said the admission of liability from the MoD was particularly important.I didn’t ask for any of this, I had every intention of working until retirement age. Because of what happened to me, my health broke down and I was left with no other option than to go through the process of ill health retirement.“It was just so stressful, it was a horrible feeling. I had confided in a few close friends who knew what I was going through. It was such a hard time.”She said finding the courage to eventually speak up had felt like a major risk at the time.“I was afraid I wouldn’t be taken seriously, especially the cougar comment, she said.“I know a lot of people, even women, can find that funny, but I don’t. He just came out with it, he had been talking about someone looking for me ‘because you’re a big cougar’. I nearly fell off the chair. I just don’t find that funny or acceptable. It was a horrible feeling, the worst thing to say to a woman.“On every occasion that he did say something, I was at my desk typing or doing my admin work. I didn’t ask for this, he came to me to insult me.”Askedshe felt the insults were down to vindictiveness or just immaturity, she replied: “I really don’t know what he was thinking. It just beggars belief what was going through his head. All I wanted was to do my job and head home, but I was absolutely dreading it.Ms Murray also thanked her legal team, solicitor Brian Archer and barrister Michael Potter, for their “total support” throughout the entire process.Most Read‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads make surrogacy historyMotorist lucky to be alive after tree falls on his car during Storm DudleyCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two months‘I dreaded going to work… but I’m totally vindicated, the truth has come out’ – woman who won £k Army harassment case speaks outSinn Fein taking Justice Minister post following next election ‘very dficult’ for unionists, claims Arlene FosterTop VideosPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy store \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedLatest Northern IrelandStorm Eunice: Ireland braces for ‘high-impact, multi-hazard weather event’Half-term holidays in Northern Ireland: A guide to the best family fun daysStorm Eunice: Met Office issues warning as second storm in a week set to hit Northern IrelandMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averagePublic urged to stay at home as Storm Eunice approachesLatestBanking Hub company will help maintain access to cashFrank Lampard open to the idea of working with a director of football at EvertonStorm Eunice: Ireland braces for ‘high-impact, multi-hazard weather event’Air pollution ‘everybody’s problem but solvable’, Sir Chris Whitty tells summitScandal allegations raise questions about monarchy’s ‘right to reign’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, some will rise more than others. Heres a guide to why this is the case, how rates are calculated and where the money goes.Read MoreBigger rates bills on way for all Northern Ireland householdsHow are rates calculated Rates are made up of two parts: the regional rate and the district rate. The regional rate is set by Stormont and, along with the block grant from the Treasury, pays for the likes of schools, health and roads. The district rate is set by your local council and pays for services that the council is responsible for, such as refuse collection, leisure provision and street cleaning.Finance Minister Conor Murphy has frozen the regional rate for the coming financial year, due to the lingering impact of the pandemic and the current poor financial climate.District rates are either domesticor non-domestic . While councils have the power to set dferent rates increases for households and businesses, this year all councils have chosen to instead set one percentage increase for both. Domestic and non-domestic rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable valuation of your home business by the combined district and regional rate.Domestic and non-domestic rates are set in terms of the number of pence in each pound of the value of your home business. For instance, in the Newry, Mourne and Down council area, the domestic rate for the   financial year is . pence, while the non-domestic rate will be . pence.Why are rates increasing, and why are they rising in some areas more than others There are several factors that councils have to take into account when setting their district rate, including cost of living, inflation, the council#s own financial reserves and other income, and the wider economic outlook.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Last year, several councils chose to freeze their rates due to the impact of the pandemic, dipping into their reserves to absorb the loss of income. Others chose to raise their rates slightly, however this has meant playing a degree of catch-up this year, when all councils have opted to hike their rates.Some councils may be able to mitigate the rise through other savings, while those local authorities which are in a more financially healthy state, can strike a lower rate and use their savings to make up for the loss.Where does the money go As mentioned, district rates pay for services the council is responsible for. Many councils also increase rates with an eye on using some of the revenue for particular projects.Ards and North Down council, for instance, has said the money for the coming financial year will go towards redeveloping Bangor Waterfront and creating an #innovation hub#, while in Belfast some revenue will go towards supporting the development of office accommodation, hotels and retail as part of city centre development. In Fermanagh and Omagh, the council said the rates will raise around £m in extra revenue, £m of which is to be set aside for waste management.Related topicsBelfast City CouncilArds and North Down Borough CouncilFermanagh and Omagh District CouncilMid and East Antrim Borough CouncilAntrim and Newtownabbey Borough CouncilCauseway Coast and Glens Borough CouncilDerry City and Strabane District CouncilArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough CouncilMore On Belfast City CouncilBigger rates bills on way for all Northern Ireland householdsBelfast councillors refuse request from cinema owners to change Batman’s rating so younger viewers can watch with parentsCall for Belfast City Council to remember Bloody Friday  years on PremiumMark BainOpinionThe end is nigh, and thankfully the world is looking brighter than two years agoCost sinks council plan to make Belfast public transport free for young peopleMost Read‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads make surrogacy historyMotorist lucky to be alive after tree falls on his car during Storm DudleySinn Fein taking Justice Minister post following next election ‘very dficult’ for unionists, claims Arlene Foster‘I dreaded going to work… but I’m totally vindicated, the truth has come out’ – woman who won £k Army harassment case speaks outCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two monthsTop VideosPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy store \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedLatest Northern IrelandBelfast Alliance councillor Michael Long criticised over ‘insensitive’ Bloody Friday tweetStorm Eunice: Ireland braces for ‘high-impact, multi-hazard weather event’Half-term holidays in Northern Ireland: A guide to the best family fun daysMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averagePublic urged to stay at home as Storm Eunice approachesLatestBrazil mudslide death toll reaches , with dozens missingJD Sports delays results to give auditors time to assess Footasylum sell-offFA warns Wayne Rooney over comments he made about injuring John Terry‘Astonishing’ that Sinn Fein could appoint advisers with convictions – ministerWales new boy Jac Morgan relishing prospect of taking on England,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Patrick’s sister Charley was their surrogate and they used a donor egg.It was a long and expensive process for the family, with heartache along the way after a first pregnancy ended in miscarriage. There were also delays caused by the pandemic.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePatrick and Jon Coyle with baby Wren, who was conceived using a donor egg and carried by Patrick’s sister Charley FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePatrick and Jon Coyle with baby Wren, who was conceived using a donor egg and carried by Patrick’s sister CharleyShortly before Wren was tucked into bed at the family home, Patrick and Jon told this newspaper about the emotional moment Charley offered to carry their baby five years ago.Patrick, who had assumed that fostering or adoption was their only choice, said: “We didn’t really think this would ever be an option for us. “We’d heard of people going to America for surrogacy but had heard it could cost , . That was something we could only dream of. Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “When we were talking about it, people would say, ‘I would love to do that for you, but...’.”A few weeks after Charley had mentioned in passing that she would help, she sat the couple down to say she was serious.Jon recalled: “From that point, it felt like a possibility. She told us her thoughts on it, how her family and her partner felt about it and how it would be for her children.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBaby Wren FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBaby WrenThe couple had considered using an egg donor clinic in Kiev but were encouraged to advertise in a local newspaper.They were stunned when they received a reply after a week, with the donor stipulating the egg should go to a gay couple. They subsequently attended a clinic in Belfast, with all family members having to go through counselling.Patrick said: “It was actually a really good gateway to open up questions that you might not have wanted to ask.“Charley [was] telling her children what way we would do things when she had the baby. “[We were asking], ‘Whatthere’s something wrong the baby  Who would decide what happens ”Jon said the couple were also prepared for facing intrusive questions about who the father of the baby was.“Who would ask that  But I’m sure plenty of people will be thinking it without saying it, so how do you manage people’s expectations ” he asked.Patrick added: “But the way the counsellor put it, why would we tell anyone who Wren’s ‘real’ daddy was before she knew “But it doesn’t matter. We’re both her daddy regardless of what has happened. “There’s loads of dferent ways to make a family. Just because ours is a little bit dferent doesn’t make it any less of a family.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePatrick’s sister Charley FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePatrick’s sister Charley“It also prepared us to tell people that it wasn’t a very nice question. And a lot of people did ask, ‘Whose sperm did you use ’”Jon added: “It’s a natural reaction, but we can tell people the boundaries about that. I have to say it was nieces and nephews that were the easiest to tell because they just accepted it.”Patrick said that Charley’s then three-year-old daughter was quick to correct anyone who congratulated her mum for becoming pregnant.He explained: “She would turn and say to them, ‘She’s not pregnant. That’s Jon and Patrick’s baby’. Charley would be killing herself laughing.”After the “heart wrenching” pain of losing the first pregnancy, Patrick faced dark timesHe recalled: “I was in turmoil some of the times, but when you look back, it was all just washed away when Wren was here.”When the couple announced the new pregnancy, their families were delighted. Jon said: “I had never seen our parents and siblings cry with that kind of joy — they couldn’t believe it.”The day of Wren’s birth was a “surreal” experience filled with hope but also concern.But they had little reason to worry because after Wren was born just before am, the new family was at home together by dinner time.Jon said: “On that drive home and going into the house, you’re thinking, ‘Right we’re supposed to know how to look after this baby’.“It was a lot to take in, but it was amazing at the same time to know that she was ours.”Jon and Patrick are sharing their parenting story on their Instagram page @dadsjourneyMost Read‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads make surrogacy historyMotorist lucky to be alive after tree falls on his car during Storm DudleySinn Fein taking Justice Minister post following next election ‘very dficult’ for unionists, claims Arlene Foster‘I dreaded going to work… but I’m totally vindicated, the truth has come out’ – woman who won £k Army harassment case speaks outCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two monthsTop VideosPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy store \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedLatest Northern IrelandBelfast Alliance councillor Michael Long criticised over ‘insensitive’ Bloody Friday tweetStorm Eunice: Ireland braces for ‘high-impact, multi-hazard weather event’Half-term holidays in Northern Ireland: A guide to the best family fun daysMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averagePublic urged to stay at home as Storm Eunice approachesLatestBrazil mudslide death toll reaches , with dozens missingJD Sports delays results to give auditors time to assess Footasylum sell-offFA warns Wayne Rooney over comments he made about injuring John Terry‘Astonishing’ that Sinn Fein could appoint advisers with convictions – ministerWales new boy Jac Morgan relishing prospect of taking on England,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurneySuzanne BreenTwitterEmailFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailColum Eastwood has accused Sinn Fein of focusing on selfish party interests rather than improving the lives of ordinary people.The SDLP leader said his rival’s -year record in government was abysmal, and while the party had engaged in radical rhetoric, it had failed to deliver.Speaking ahead of his party’s annual conference this weekend, Mr Eastwood said that despite lacklustre poll ratings, the SDLP hoped to secure two ministries in the next Executive.However, he refused rule out going into oppositionhe didn’t believe that it would be “a government truly working for the people”.In a wide-ranging interview, he described Doug Beattie as “a breath of fresh air within unionism”. While he was aghast at the UUP leader’s tweets, he respected how he had faced up to his mistakes, taken the heat and opened himself up to scrutiny in media interviews.Mr Eastwood also said he had no regrets about using parliamentary privilege to name Soldier F, who faced murder charges for his actions on Bloody Sunday.He said he was “giving a voice” to the people of Derry in a House of Commons that desperately needs to hear views from Northern Ireland other than the DUP’s.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Despite at times sharing similar policies with Sinn Fein, Mr Eastwood insisted the parties were in practice very dferent.“Sinn Fein are interested in themselves alone. They’re focused on what benefits them as a party, what improves their position, securing community jobs for their mates,” he said.“They’ve been at the top in Stormont since  and have failed to change the lives of working-class communities despite having their hands on the levers of power.“After  years, you’ve had your chance. Those who don’t deliver should be punished at the ballot box. “Sinn Fein are not outsiders. With the DUP, they are the political establishment in the North.”Mr Eastwood was unimpressed with Sinn Fein’s performance in the current Executive: “They talk a lot, but don’t seem to do much. What have they actually achieved “Nichola Mallon and Robin Swann have been the outstanding ministers in the Executive. I don’t see too many others that have done much.”The SDLP leader accused the DUP of pursuing a “destructive and unbelievably foolish course of action”y.He expects his party to improve on its  seats and % vote in the  Assembly election. He is hoping it will secure a similar vote to its  Westminster result of %.“We would hope to gain enough seats to have two ministers in the next executive,” Mr Eastwood said.“We are running to be in government. It’s in our DNA to be in government.”But he said he could not rule out going into opposition “ we think it’s a government that will do nothing for the people”.On just % in this week’s Irish News Institute of Irish Studies of University of Liverpool poll, the SDLP seems to have a steep hill to climbit is tomore MLAs. Successive LucidTalk polls for the Belfasthave put the party in fourth or fth position.“I think that too much attention is given to polls in Northern Ireland,” Mr Eastwood said“As a deeply ided society, it’s one of the hardest places to poll. You have five political parties within  to % of each other, so it’s complicated.“We are not blind to polls, but neither are we worried about them. We do our own research and we’re confident that we’re not on %.”Mr Eastwood said the DUP’s decision to collapse the Executive had polarised the political environment in a way that suited Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s party and Sinn Fein.But the SDLP leader predicted it would not be a “pro- or anti-protocol” election.“In my office in Derry, people aren’t talking about the protocol. They’re worried about bills and hospital waiting lists. They’re annoyed at sluggish government.“There has been no response to the cost of living crisis by Stormont. In Scotland, the government is putting money into people’s bank accounts. Ours is doing nothing.”The SDLP leader said that in some constituencies, his party would be battling with Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s for the last seat, “and that will create a dynamic which helps us”.He cited Strangford as its best chance of a gain, followed by Fermanagh and South Tyrone and West Belfast, “while there’s an outside chance we will be in the mix at the end in South Antrim”.The SDLP faces a tough battle to retain its seats in three constituencies. However, Mr Eastwood was “very confident” Pat Catney would be re-elected in Lagan Valley he said Dolores Kelly should “never be written off” in Upper Bann and he believed his party had “enough votes to keep our two seats in South Down”.The SDLP leader said he wouldn’t be advising voters who to transfer to. “There’ll be dferent considerations in dferent constituencies,” he said. He would like people “to vote progressively and for change”.AskedSDLP supporters should transfer to unionist candidates he said: “If a candidate is progressive, then there shouldn’t be community barriers to giving them a preference. In the polling booth, I have and will transfer across the community ide.”In the wake of Doug Beattie’s tweet scandal, Mr Eastwood said he had “failed the leadership test”.Askedthe UUP leader should have resigned, he replied: “What Doug did was wrong and dficult to understand, but there was something very powerful in his ability to face up to his mistakes and to take the heat.“I think in those circumstances, people are ready to forgive. I certainly don’t agree with Doug on everything, but I like him. I think he’s coming at things from a good place. He’s a breath of fresh air for unionism.”Mr Eastwood said it had been “very important” for him to name Soldier F in the Commons.“The Bloody Sunday families wanted him outed and I wanted my constituents’ voices heard,” he explained.“I received numerous death threats for it, some more sinister than others. That’s fine for me, but it was hard for my family.“I didn’t believe anything would happen to them, but you still worry when you’re away from home at nights.”Mr Eastwood insisted that his party had influence at Westminster: “Claire Hanna and I are not going to overturn an -seat majority, but it’s vital that we — along with Stephen Farry — are there and it’s not just the DUP being heard.”He said that would particularly be the casean Executive could not be formed after May’s election and direct rule was reintroduced.The potential partnership with Fianna Fail, which Mr Eastwood had championed, is clearly now dead in the water for the SDLP.  Asked about the possibility, he would say only that he was “in regular contact” with Fianna Fail and that the shared island unit had “come out of our conversations” with Micheal Martin.Claire Hanna had strongly opposed any merger. Effectively acknowledging it was totally off the agenda now, Mr Eastwood stressed: “The SDLP stands on its own two feet.“We’ve moved beyond old arguments. I work very well with Claire Hanna at Westminster and she’s part of the leadership team.”The SDLP leader also categorically ruled out ever personally seeking a dual mandate. He dismissed rumours that he had been planning on running for Stormont as “absolute nonsense”.Related topicsSDLPSinn FéinThe Executive OfficeUlster Unionist PartyBloody SundayNichola MallonLucidTalk pollSir Jeffrey DonaldsonClaire HannaStephen FarryMost Read‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads make surrogacy historyMotorist lucky to be alive after tree falls on his car during Storm DudleySinn Fein taking Justice Minister post following next election ‘very dficult’ for unionists, claims Arlene Foster‘I dreaded going to work… but I’m totally vindicated, the truth has come out’ – woman who won £k Army harassment case speaks outCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two monthsTop VideosPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy store \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedLatestFA warns Wayne Rooney over comments he made about injuring John Terry‘Astonishing’ that Sinn Fein could appoint advisers with convictions – ministerWales new boy Jac Morgan relishing prospect of taking on EnglandSnapchat to allow username changes for the first timeBelfast Alliance councillor Michael Long criticised over ‘insensitive’ Bloody Friday tweet,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I don’t believe we should continue with a mandatory system.”Higher Education Minister Simon Harris, speaking to media at the launch of the national rollout of the Innovation Exchange at the Guinness Enterprise Centre, predicted that the Government would act “swtly” after receiving the advice.Mr Harris said that the Nphet meeting came amid a “positive trajectory and backdrop”.“I expect they will communicate their advice to Government later today and the Government will act swtly in relation to that advice,” he told reporters.“I think the justication for any regulation or restriction or public health measure always needs to be grounded in public health advice.“And there is no justication for any regulation unless it correlates with public health advice, so I’ll put it like that.“It is the clear intention of Government not to wish to extend regulations, unless there was a public health rationale for doing so.”He said that it was not yet decided whether the Cabinet would meet on Friday, following receipt of the latest guidance from health officials.He said that he did not believe it was a “particularly controversial” issue to consider.Labour leader Alan Kelly said earlier that for many people the review of mandatory mask wearing is a “welcome sign” that the pandemic is ending.“But many unions, Mandate and others that represent transport and retailin particular, have had concerns,” Mr Kelly added.There will be a lot of anxiety for staff and people who are vulnerable and this will impact especially on those considering using trains, buses and other forms of public transportAlan Kelly“Patricia Kinghas called for the rules to be kept for a short period.“There will be a lot of anxiety for staff and people who are vulnerable and this will impact especially on those considering using trains, buses and other forms of public transport.”Mr Ryan also told the Dail that he hopes measures to cut the cost of public transport will be brought in throughout April.The Government announced plans to cut fares by % last week as part of its measures to tackle the cost of living.People aged between  and  will also receive a % discount on public transport.Mr Kelly said encouraging people back on to public transport is “essential” to meet climate change targets.“Emissions were up % at the end of September versus ,” he said.Mr Ryan said the number of people using public transport is about % of pre-Covid levels.“It ies across the country. The long-distance commuting numbers are not back,” Mr Ryan added.“The cost-of-living measures that we introduced last week, it wasn’t just for cost-of-living reasons, as urgent as they were, it was also trying to get public transport a boost to this time, so we don’t see just the road space all taken up by people going back to cars.“We want to encourage people back on public transport, it is safe and we want the numbers back up.”He said he hopes to see both measures brought in by the end of April.Most Read‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads make surrogacy historyMotorist lucky to be alive after tree falls on his car during Storm DudleySinn Fein taking Justice Minister post following next election ‘very dficult’ for unionists, claims Arlene Foster‘I dreaded going to work… but I’m totally vindicated, the truth has come out’ – woman who won £k Army harassment case speaks outCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two monthsTop VideosPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy store \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedLatest Republic of Ireland‘Astonishing’ that Sinn Fein could appoint advisers with convictions – ministerStorm Eunice: Ireland braces for ‘high-impact, multi-hazard weather event’EU facing ‘changed’ landscape as world emerges from pandemic, says MartinHiggins highlights lack of progress on education integration in Northern IrelandEamon Ryan ‘hopes to see immediate end’ of mandatory mask wearingLatestHillary Clinton thriller to be turned into action filmBrazil mudslide death toll reaches , with dozens missingJD Sports delays results to give auditors time to assess Footasylum sell-offFA warns Wayne Rooney over comments he made about injuring John Terry‘Astonishing’ that Sinn Fein could appoint advisers with convictions – minister,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When it was announced that the new curator would be serving both Newry and Downpatrick this caused great consternation.ldquoWe can understand that frustration and since our local councils were brought together seven years ago where parity should have existed between Newry, Mourne and Down, it has felt that the legacy Down area has been left behind somewhat.ldquoWe have to be straightforward about the facts and Downpatrick is the county town. This carries major signicance. The historical and ecclesiastical heritage of Downpatrick is equally signicant, as is our links to St Patrick. The museum in Downpatrick is the Down County Museum and must be treated as such.The SDLP politicians say while they appreciate the local authorityrsquos need for a curator that serves both Downpatrick and Newry, they are firmly on the view that the curator must be based in Downpatrick.Cllr Enright confirmed that he and Cllr Brown have also been meeting with the Friends of the Museum over the past few weeks and will be calling for a special motion on the restructuring plan to be debated publicly at next monthrsquos full council meeting.ldquoThe council proposal makes no sense whatsoever at all to promote the relatively insignicant Bagelrsquos Castle in Newry over the Down County Museum which is one of the premier professional conservancy and historical centres in Northern Ireland, added Cllr Enright.Cllr Brownrsquos motion calls for a full-time curator to be based at and responsible for the Down County Museum and that the existing curatorial posts of keeper and assistant keeper of collections are permanently filled and not downgraded, with the vital and highly skilled role of the museumrsquos technician photographer also retained and not downgraded.ldquoI am calling for council officers to develop, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, a new, long-term strategic plan for how the council can most effectively invest in museums across the district, he confirmed.ldquoCouncillors are highly concerned by the plans to downgrade staff provision at the Down County Museum and to base the only full-time museum curator in Newry.

Arrested in Belfast in September , he was a prisoner in Dublin when the Rising raged in  and was despatched along with other State prisoners to Fort George in Scotland the following year.Liberated in , Russell threw himself back into revolutionary politics in support of Robert Emmetrsquos ill-fated coup by attempting to raise once again the standard of rebellion in Co Down. After an anticlimactic call to arms in Loughinisland in July , Russell escaped the county only to be arrested in Dublin and ed to Downpatrick for trial and execution.One of the earliest collections acquired four decades ago by the fledgling Down County Museum was a small parcel of documents relating to the trial of Thomas Russell.The documents include the order from the viceroy, Lord Hardwicke, to initiate proceedings against Russell and the list of jurors who would decide his fate, not that it was ever in doubt. Also contained within the collection is a series of fascinating depositions sworn before local gentry which condemned not only Russell, but two Co Down men, James Corry and James Drake, to execution.The improbability of success for the  Rising is revealed in the deposition of Patrick Doran from Annadorn, who said that ldquonone but fools andmadmen would endorse a Rising so soon after the sobering experience of . Doranrsquos deposition goes on to describe Russellrsquos green Generalrsquos coat, decorated with gold lace and rich epaulettes.Another deposition, from Hugh Magennis, of Ballydugan, provides us with the vivid impression of Russellrsquos ldquomilitary step and appearance, while William Cosby of Saintfield described the mysterious stranger of Wilsonrsquos ballad as a ldquolarge handsome looking man.Such witness statements helped to deliver a guilty verdict and Russell was executed outside the County Gaol, now Down County Museum, on Friday, October , . He was buried in the parish churchyard his gravestone arranged and paid for by the indomitable Mary Ann McCracken of Belfast.These documents held in Down County Museum shed considerable light on an episode of local history that had profound national signicance. Scholars of th century Ireland have visited the museum to consult its rich archive and conferences staged there to discuss the sitersquos deep imprint on Irish history and memory.The size and quality of its collections and the historical importance of its buildings underpin the importance of the internationally-recognised Down County Museum.The ongoing depletion of its highly-qualied and committed staff, which under Newry, Mourne and Down Council proposals now appears to include only a part-time curator, the replacement of the keeper of collections and an assistant with two new positions at a signicantly lower grade, and the removal of the important position of a photographer technician, reflects a disregard for the heritage industry in the county and represents an insult to the hundreds of donors who presented valued family possessions to Down County Museum in the good faith that the Council would preserve, celebrate and cherish them.The fear of many is that the downgrading of the Museum mdash for that is what this is mdash will lead to a reluctance among the public to donate artefacts to the collection and undermine applications for the funding of future projects.The public knows exactly what kind of jewel we have in Down County Museum.

The plans will include a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.Cllr Mason also reaffirmed the view that the rear of the Newcastle Centre is no longer fit for purpose and, as a result, will be demolished in the near future.She continued: ldquoFor too long, the people of Newcastle have had to put up with substandard facilities. I hope to see the finalised plans for the new leisure complex and site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.The council chairwoman said it is essential that the local authority ldquomoves in a timely manner to ensure the leisure centre project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access the new facilities as soon as possible.Cllr Mason said Sinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure the new leisure facilities are delivered, insisting that she will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to provide essential services in the heart of their respective communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Roads officials urged to address pedestrian safety in Darragh Cross  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to consider providing a new pedestrian crossing in Darragh Cross as part of a series of measures to make the village safer.The appeal was made by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown when he met with a local roads official in the village last week to discuss increasing concern about pedestrian safety as a result of the speed of vehicles.The Department for Infrastructure has said while there will not be a mph zone implemented in Darragh Cross due to current legislation, it has been asked to extend the current mph in force outside the villagersquos primary school and the nearby Barnamaghery Road.Cllr Brown has also asked the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership to locate one of its electronic speed indicator signs in the village.He said the devices have helped reduce speed in other areas and believes that one in Darragh Cross would be effective with a decision on his request expected next month.ldquoA speed indicator device will help address speeding concerns in an area where children are particularly vulnerable and I would like the sign in place as soon as possible, he continued.ldquoI have also discussed with roads officials the potential opportunity for a pedestrian crossing near the main shop which would be funded by the government departmentrsquos active travel department, which would be another welcome measure for pedestrians in Darragh Cross.Cllr Brown said that as a result of his recent meeting which he described as ldquoconstructive, roads officials gave a commitment to assess safety railings in place a Manse Road.ldquoThis particular issue was raised with me last month as damage to part of the railings is adding to residentsrsquo safety concerns. The assessment will happen after the new local authority-funded play park has been built at the GAA site, he said.Cllr Brown confirmed that he is also pushing for the safety railings to be extended from the Oaks Restaurant to the GAA ground to ldquomaximise the safety of residents, in particular, families with young children who will be making frequent use of the site.He added: ldquoI share residentsrsquo concerns about road safety in Darragh Cross and believe that enacting these measures over the coming months should be a departmental priority.ldquoHowever, I hope that collectively, these steps will begin to alleviate many of the villagersquos safety concerns for the future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_Traders.jpg","title":"Traders invited to get  involved in town future  ","story":"TRADERS in Downpatrick are being urged to have their say on the future development of the town with a primary focus on what can be done to revive its economic fortunes.The appeal comes after Newry, Mourne and Down Council confirmed that it is to organise a workshop event to gauge the business communityrsquos key priorities, particularly in a post-Covid environment.Details of the workshop event comes as the debate continues about appointing a dedicated town centre manager who would act as a link between the business community and wide range of statutory agencies and funders to help drive new initiatives and opportunities.Council officers have already spoken with a number of businesses on the issue, but it was confirmed at Monday nightrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee that a more co-ordinated plan now needs to be developed.Officials argue this is necessary in order to agree priorities on the way forward to manage expectations through the development of strategy focused on the needs of the town.Plans for a workshop to discuss the issue are being drawn up with appeals to everyone in business in Downpatrick to take part to provide as wide ofview of the potential way forward as possible.The workshop will focus on the main priorities to help develop a new strategy with calls for an independent person to head up the exercise which, it is hoped, will outline recommendations on the way forward.A proposal to appoint a Downpatrick town centre manager to help plan the townrsquos economic revival and long-term future was tabled last year and referred to the council committee for discussion.A number of councillors believe such an appointment is a ldquocritical component of the drive to support the business community, increase footfall and, crucially, help attract new investment to the county town.It has been suggested a town centre manager could work closely with the business community to develop fresh ideas and initiatives, but nothingwill happen before the outcome of the proposed workshop is known.Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed confirmation of the workshop and are fully supportive of the development of a strategic plan being mapped out for the town.Cllr Curran believes that appointing town centre manager deserves close attention and is keen to hear what the business community and other stakeholders have already said about the way forward.ldquoI see great merit in having a dedicated town centre manager, he continued.ldquoThe proposed workshop that is to be held is crucially important and I would appeal to everyone in business to get involved and have their say. This is a crucially important exercise and it must happen as soon as possible.Cllr Curran believes one area that requires particular focus is developing Downpatrickrsquos night-time economy which he is confident would help breathe new le into the town centre.He is also keen for Downpatrick to have an umbrella body representing all business groups and interests, pointing to the success of Chambers of Commerce which he believes play important roles.ldquoAgreeing the way forward for Downpatrick is crucial and a new strategy can help kick-start the townrsquos economic revival, especially at a time when ambitious plans are being advanced for the regeneration of the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty adjacent buildings, Cllr Curran added.Welcoming plans for the workshop, Cllr Hanlon said it has been identied that a strategic plan needs to be considered to focus on the needs of the town.She also confirmed that she as met with a number of stakeholders who believe that Downpatrick needs a strategic plan.ldquoThere is so much effort and productive work from local groups such as the Town Committee and Community Collective alongside local businesses, Cllr Hanlon continued. ldquoEngagement from a iety of stakeholders via theworkshop will ensure that we have a bold and progressive plan for the future of Downpatrick.She added: ldquoCouncil assistance to facilitate this is will be imperative as we continue to build our local economy, arts and events offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_Minister.jpg","title":"Tributes and presentations to Downpatrick clergyman  ","story":"ANOTHER chapter in the distinguished history of Downpatrick Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church closed last Sunday when the Rev Dr David Speers preached his final service after  yearsrsquo service.Dr Steers, who was also in charge of Ballee and Clough Non-Subscribing Presbyterian churches, is leaving the district to take up a new post in Dunmurry.He introduced his final service with the history of the replica High Cross which stands at the entrance to the Down Cathedral, explaining how its engravings depict Jesus Christ and the prophets St Anthony and Paul and how the illustrations guided the early Christians over a thousand years agoDr Steers said the Non-Subscribing congregation in Downpatrick worships in a building erected over  years ago, encouraging them to keep this faith going.He continued this theme with readings from Psalm  and the first letter to John, explaining the dference in the perception of God from the Old to the New Testament, with the departing ministerrsquos sermon reminding the congregation that despite their comfortable lives, to continue to do Godrsquos work in the community.Laura Patterson accompanied the hymns lsquoHoly, holy, holyrsquo, lsquoJust as I amrsquo, The Lordrsquos my shepherdrsquo and lsquoGod sent his Sonrsquo.At the conclusion of the service, church treasurer, Carol Nixon, spoke of Dr Steers leadership, pastoral care and how he led by example, fully participating in all the church worship and witness as well as many fundraising events.In addition, she reminded those in attendance of his leadership, both within the church group and in the community where he is well known and respected by all denominations, and wishing him the congregationrsquos blessing in his new charge.The Downpatrick churchrsquos senior elder, Mr Freddie Straney, made a presentation to Dr Steers and thanked him for his loyalty and  yearsrsquo service.Eileen Neill, on behalf of the younger members, presented Dr. Steers with a delightful and talented illustration of the Downpatrick church which she had created, with Ms Nixon presenting the ministerrsquos we Sue, with a flower arrangement, thanking her for the many ways she had supported her husband both in and outside the pulpit.Also during Sundayrsquos service, the congregation took the opportunity of presenting Mary Stewart with a gold brooch, church illustration by Eileen Neill, flowers and rose plants to mark her  years as church secretary.Dr Steers responded to his gts with moving words which touched everyonersquos spirit.He recalled how he became associated with the church in  and was in charge in  before being fully appointed in the group, also thanking Mary for all her work.The ious speeches were dficult and emotional, but very sincere and from the heart. It was a day of surprises which will remain in the thoughts of the retiring minister and his we, church members and office-bearers.Although Covid restrictions prevented the members from giving Dr. Steers and Sue a send-off befitting their service to them, such was their appreciation that it took two hours for everyone to say farewell.As the churchrsquos fourth longest serving minister, Dr Steers completed  years in full time charge in addition to being minister-in-charge for several sessions between  and .He was a member of the local ministerial group which organises collective worship and remembrance events such as inter-denominational services and Remembrance Sunday as well as highlighting and supporting worthy causes.Over the years Dr Steers conducted in excess  regular services as well as special services including Christmas celebrations. In addition, he undertook over  memorial services as well as weddings, renewal of vows and baptisms with these totals undoubtedly tripling when the Ballee and Clough churches are included.Dr Steers represented the denomination in  at a special service in Transylvania and attended and conducted the funeral services both here and on the mainland of some of the churchrsquos most distinguished serving ministers.Over the years, while celebrating the churchrsquos tercentenary, Dr Steers was a tremendous support in the church history and, more recently, its graveyard inion booklet.He also compiled a book entitled rsquoFirst World War Roll of Honour of the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church of Irelandrsquo containing all the members of the denomination who served and who gave their lives in defence of our country. The publication was launched at a special service in our church in November .Former church secretary Mary Stewart added: ldquoWhen the church history is read in years to come our records, just as they have down through the ages, will record names and dates of those who served.ldquoWe know however that a le of service goes beyond this. It includes sharing moments of sadness and tears but also memories of joy and laughter which we have had together in Downpatrick. We wish Dr. Steers, his we Sue and the family, good health and happiness in his new appointment in Dunmurry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13227668.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The DUP’s recent much more minor action of resigning from the executive shortly before an election is in an entirely dferent context, of major constitutional change having been imposed on Northern Ireland, compromising the principle of consent to placate nationalist Ireland.It is striking that the badly needed plan to overhaul the stadia has been stopped and the redevelopment of Casement is going ahead. Mr Murphy says it is an insult to describe the discrepancy as sectarian but it is not surprising that many football fans will interpret the dferent treatment in that way, particularly when the party defending the stadium decision is so reliably tribal and so reliably opposed to proposals that unionist politicians hold dear.It is appalling that the £ million earmarked for sub-regional stadia is not progressing.It is a huge setback for clubs such as Coleraine FC, which have waited so patiently for improvements, and which had drawn up feasible plans for them.As the IFA CEO Patrick Nelson has said see our back page, local football needs investment.Mr Nelson points out that the sub-regional funding was included in the  New Decade New Approach deal to restore Stormont.The only part of that deal that a Conservative and Unionist government intends to rush through is the part that Sinn Fein demands, relating to the gaelic language.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I’ve worked very well with the IFAand indeed with all sporting codes from when I came into post, I’ve engaged them on a regular basis.“They actually worked very closely with me throughout the pandemic, in not just stabilising those sectors, but also working to address the needs of the community through food parcels and through prescriptions.“This is not a sectarian issue and it’s not a Casement versus sub-regional.”Deidre HargeySinn FeinConor MurphyDUPGAA  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularThis is no time for unionist weakness on the Irish Sea borderStorm warnings for Northern Ireland now include heavy snowBelfast university culture spat: ‘No-one is convinced by efforts to portray the Irish language as cross-community’What time will Storm Eunice hit  When and where will Storm Eunice hit - and will it snow in Northern Ireland Storm Eunice Northern Ireland: Weather forecast for Northern Ireland as Met Office warns of snow and windMost PopularBest Aldi dupes : top perfume, skincare, beauty, makeup, cleansing balm products from Lacura to le CreusetHow to boost your home wi signal: the best wi router extenders  from BT, Netgear, Orbi, and AmazonCan the right mattress help with back pain  We review Simba, Nectar, Dormeo and Tempur mattressesBest snow sled and tobaggans UK : sleds for adults and children including plastic, wooden and inflatableRoyal Mint releases commemorative £ coin to mark  years of FA Cup                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The Irish News said the idea is to house people who are studying languages together, and as part of this scheme some Irish-specic accommodation is expected to be in place by September.Queen’s itself has stressed that it is still only a proposal, not a concrete plan, and that it would merely be in line with similar schemes in other unis.The Orange Society wrote a letter to the university calling the idea “cultural apartheid” which would “only serve the principle of segregation”.Cumann na Gaelach then hit back, saying that is a “depressing view” and that “everyone owns the language”.Many online supporters of the Cumann echoed this sentiment, saying it is perfectly possible for Protestants to embrace the language too.Mr Patterson responded: “While it may be true that Protestant Irish speakers could avail of this accommodation, and we do not deny that a very small minority of the same might exist, no one is convinced by this argument.“The vast majority of Protestants do not consider the Irish language to be a part of their cultural heritage and there has been a strong association between it and the Nationalist   Republican movement in Northern Ireland.“This dferentiates the scheme and others in place at universities in the Republic and mainland UK.“In this way it creates de-facto exclusion zones for Protestant and Unionist students and would further add to the concerning track-record of Queen’s on this issue.”He added that whilst the Orange society does have its own accommodation schemeit insists that this is a wholly dferent matter, because it is a case of private housing, not university-run housing.Meanwhile Linda Ervine today added her voice to the debate as well. The sister in law of dead PUP chief David, who has run Irish classes in loyalist east Belfast for years, said: “Great to see QUB providing the same type of residential scheme that is available in other UK universities.“It will be particularly beneficial for students from PUL backgrounds as often they have less opportunity to practise their language skills outside of the classroom.”MORE FROM THIS REPORTER:Click here: Lawsuits against the state from people interned in Northern Ireland  years ago now number up to Click here: RUC ‘collusive’ findings – WATCH as DUP man denounces IRA while speaker Alex Maskey tries to rein him in for ‘going off-topic’Click here: Catholic   Protestant quotas now in force in  new housing estates – with  more to come——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The next phase would be to transform a three-acre grass area beside the stadium into a G area for community use.The final phase of the vision is for an all-seater stadium with an international-size pitch accommodating between , and , spectators.

We do intend to do that through the [UK Government’s] ‘Levelling Up Fund’.“That in itself would give us a separate area where we could have all our youth groups, community groups, I don’t care who they are as long as the place is thriving, it’s vibrant, being utilised seven days a week.“That is always the aim of the club to bring the community into the area around the club. What it will do is regenerate the area of Coleraine which is an area of deprivation – that’s not me saying that, that is the statistics that are produced for Northern Ireland.”He added: “What we were looking for through the Sub Regional Stadia Programme was to create a North West Regional Stadium with state of the art training facilities and a community hub.“If you’re a team, say from Scotland, who doesn’t want to be going to Spain for pre-season training on an annual basis, Coleraine is right on your doorstep. There’s some great golf courses for a bit of rest and relaxation, great hotels – it all makes sense.”He said: “It was incredibly disappointing but not unexpected when the minister made the announcement.“I sincerely hope that we as a footballing family all come together and put pressure on the minister to reverse her judgement.“I would also strongly support engaging with the Gaelic community, I believe both communities need the facilities.“My thinking is that all the sporting communities should come together and put pressure on the minister to reverse her judgement.“It’s very disappointing that sport finds itself embroiled in a political situation, there are undoubtedly those who are using this is a political weapon, all they’re doing is depriving the youth and prosperity of all of society by their shortsightedness.”He added: “We’re proceeding with all our plans and hopefully further down the line after the election when there’s new candidates in, the money can be resurrected.”Intermediate club Bangor FC planned to use funding from the Department for Communities ill-fated stadia programme as part of the club’s push toto the Premiership.Largely based on cash from Deirdre Hargey’s department, the club – who have been absent from Northern Ireland’s top ision for more than  years – submitted a planning application for a new -seater grandstand and community hub.Bangor FC Chairman Graham Bailie said: “We are extremely disappointed about the news of the funding package for football stadia in Northern Ireland being shelved. “These funds were set to transform football club facilities across Northern Ireland. “A new modern grandstand and community hub are an essential step in the evolution of our plans to bring Premiership football back to Bangor FC. “Our ambition is to continue making progress on the pitch, and supporting the local community off it. “That is why we included a community hub at the heart of this project. “However, it was always dependent on securing a combination of public funds, from the Sub Regional Stadia Programme, and private investment opportunities.” He said the club now needs an answer to the question of whether the funding will now be available in the budget which spans  to . Mr Bailie said: “Bangor is one of the largest conurbations in Northern Ireland, and our continued vision is to upgrade the ground to match this position, as we progress through the leagues andto the Irish Premiership.”Despite the obvious setback, he said: “We need to keep trying to push forward, so as a board we are working through all other options which we think might be available. “The facility upgrade is needed in order for us to continue our progress.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This is new funding for the Welsh Government.“People in Wales expect both governments to be working together for them, their families and communities so we will continue engage with them on this support.”The UK Government said that while devolved governments receive a forecast of funding they are likely to receive through the Barnett mechanism, these are estimates only.It said that the Barnett consequentials are less than first thought due to a lower health spending than planned in England, after the Omicron iant of Covid- had lesser impact on the health service than forecast.It said this drop was unconnected to the council tax rebate funding.Welsh Conservative Leader, Andrew RT Davies, said: “I am pleased to see the new money that has come from the Conservative UK Government put to good use by Cardf Bay ministers as Welsh Conservatives have been calling for.“It is just a shame Labour couldn’t help themselves and have a pop at British ministers who have led the way in finding a resolution to this.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIn a letter to UK immigration minister Kevin Foster, representatives of the three devolved administrations claimed that processes for skilled workers looking to come to Britain were “inflexible, costly and bureaucratic” and had also served to “exclude many of the key workers that we need, many of whom have been crucial during the Covid- pandemic”.The letter, from Wales social justice minister, Jane Hutt, Scottish Europe minister, Neil Gray, and Northern Ireland economy minister, Gordon Lyons, states there are “severe labour and skills shortages” in all four nations of the UK.But they claim the UK Government has failed to “work constructively” with the devolved administrations to try to tackle the problem.The Welsh, Scottish, and Northern Irish politicians insisted the Home Office should “immediately reintroduce” regular four-way meetings where such issues can be discussed.They told Mr Foster: “The UK Government has said it wants the immigration system to work for all parts of the UK.“Without a commitment to regular and meaningful engagement with the devolved governments, this is simply not possible.”UK ministers were also urged to “immediately review the immigration skills and health surcharges and reduce additional fees”, with Governments in Edinburgh, Cardf and Belfast arguing these can be an “insurmountable barrier for both workers and employers”.They added: “As it stands, the UK has one of the most costly immigration systems and this cannot continueit is to be an attractive destination for global talent moving forward.”Ms Hutt, Mr Gray, and Mr Lyons repeated calls for the devolved administrations to be given a formal role in deciding which occupations there is a shortage of in their nations, in a bid to make it easier to recruit overseas workers to these posts..remove“We call upon the UK Government to act urgently,” they said.The three ministers told Mr Foster it was critical that their administrations are involved in the issue, arguing: “Migration is a cross-cutting policy area affecting many aspects of devolved competency including the economy, housing, healthcare and the delivery of local services.”However they claimed: “Sadly in spite of our efforts, the UK Government has consistently failed to consult, collaborate, or work constructively with the devolved Governments on any changes pertaining to the immigration system.“This is despite the severe labour and skills shortages faced across all four nations which can largely be attributed to the excessively restrictive UK immigration system.”They added: “We are doing everything within our respective powers to ensure that the needs of businesses are met, but the action we take must be supplemented by immediate changes to the immigration system in order to quickly access the labour and skills our nations need to survive the current crisis.”A spokeswoman for the Home Office said: “Our points-based immigration system is focused on talent and skills and makes it much easier for the brightest and best to live and study in the UK.“We continue to engage with the devolved administrations on immigration policies but it is important that employers make long term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

He tried to come out of this question with a good answer and he did it.”On being tipped for a future United role, Hasenhuttl continued: “This is not in my mind and also not the things that are interesting me.“I don’t want to speak about my future every week.“Last week we spoke about dferent things, and this week we should be speaking about the game we have now against Everton.“This is more interesting for me, my whole focus and whole energy is on this game.

You go into the likes of Ballybogey and Bushmills and they have facilities for all weather and they can play all year round.“We have  kids eager to play and yet we go through this every year and the pitch cuts up. It can’t take the weather and can’t take the elements.”Portrush FC Youths would like to see a G or G pitch installed enabling the youngsters to play in all conditions.Mr Quigley said: “Let’s move with the times. We are happy to try funding, we know council don’t have the money to pay for it all but eventhey say we are willing to pay a percentage towards it but unfortunately we aren’t getting anything from them.“There’s a chance some of those kids won’t come back. They are trying to run through the muck and there’s tears because they were falling in the mud then they were soaking wet and freezing cold. These are six and seven-year olds, it would be dferentthey were on a G pitch that wouldn’t be an issue and it’s a far better environment.“It’s demoralising for us as coaches to go down there and try and get kids to kick a ball through a mud bath.”Addressing his comments to the councillors who represent the Causeway DEA, the club Chairman added: “Please come down and take a look at it for yourselves and see what we deal with on a daily basis. Speak to the coaches, the parents and children.“These kids are speaking to their friends who are saying I was training at Coleraine on the G or at The Showgrounds but we don’t have that luxury, we can’t even get a slot up there to hold a training session.“We don’t really want to take the kids out of Portrush and not everybody has a car and then we have to take into account the additional cost of travel for parents.“It is so frustrating that from  when I started to  we are still struggling with the same issue. We have kids coming from all over, from Bushmills and Portstewart as well as Portrush and people have had enough. Would you want your kids playing in conditions like this  I doubt it.”The DUP Causeway DEA councillors spoke of their commitment to help Portrush FC Youths adding that a meeting has been arranged with the club and council officials within the coming days which is the next stage of an ongoing process.Councillor Mark Fielding said: “I have been working with the club on ious issues since  and will continue assist them now and in the future.“It is quite obvious that there is issues to resolve with the current facilities in order to ensure that they are of a standard that meets the needs of the club and local people.”Fellow Causeway DUP Councillor John McAuley added: “Following contact this morning from Portrush FC Youth regards the condition of their facilities, I have had discussions with the club and council officers with a view to achieving short, medium and long term improvements. “I have been involved in local football now for nearly  years so I am well aware that winter training has and continues to cause many clubs a problem. “The good news is resolutions are possible and have been achieved in other areas of the borough in the past.“I am committed to giving Portrush FC Youths support to get the same outcomes for their facilities.East Londonderry MLA Maurice Bradley said: “I was in talks two years ago with council officers on behalf of the Coleraine and District League as part of the council’s consultation process into the borough’s pitch strategy. “As part of an overall strategy it was recognised that there was a lack of G facilities in the borough and Parker Avenue was in the mix along with other sites.“I would be happy to meet with Portrush Football Club and Portrush Youths at any time to discuss facilities. “I have been having meetings with council officers with the hope of having roll-on, roll-off goals at Parker Avenue and other grounds.“I believe that facilities are important, facilities allow clubs to grow and sports enthusiasts to improve. “But, in the short term, I would encourage members of Portrush Youths to lobby their local councillors.“Having been involved for many years in football and campaigning for better football facilities right across the old Coleraine Borough Council area, I support improving facilities for Portrush Youths and also for all clubs across the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council area.”Meanwhile, SDLP MLA Cara Hunter posted on the club’s social media that she would ‘be writing to the Department for Communities and Sport NI to identythere are any funds to resolve this ongoing issue.’When contacted, a spokesperson for Causeway Coast  Glens Council said: “The club’s designated training pitch was passed fit for purpose at the beginning of this week.“Council officers will visit the site today to assess the ground conditions and, in the interim, will engage with the club to offer an alternate venue.”The Local Democracy Reporting Service contacted other councillors, however, they had not responded at time of going to press.Read More Read MoreKillowen PS kids learn about ‘refill’Mark FieldingCara HunterPortrushBushmills  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularSports clubs in Portadown and Lurgan pay tribute to Davy Mat...NewsStorm Dudley: Trees blocking roads and more than , with...News approached by male driver on Lurgan street\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime witness-appeal-after-girl-approached-by-male-driver- itm_sourceparsely-api\" approached by male driver on Lurgan street\" \"\" width\"\" approached by male driver on Lurgan street\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime witness-appeal-after-girl-approached-by-male-driver- itm_sourceparsely-api\"PSNI witness appeal: Girlapproached by male driver on ...NewsOmicron scam warning as public asked to fork out for test ki...NewsMiles the missing Portadown cat is found after mammoth three...NewsMost PopularBest boot deals  -

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dcfebdaaafeae   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cecdeddacea   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1606908037252.jpg--remaining_northern_ireland_coronavirus_laws_lifted.jpg?160690804100","title":"remaining northern ireland coronavirus laws lifted ","story":"The remaining coronavirus restrictions and face-covering regulations are to be scrapped, Health Minister Robin Swann has confirmed. They are to be replaced by guidance after Mr Swann obtained support for the move from his fellow ministers. Social distancing, regulations on the number people allowed in homes and the COVID passport scheme are also gone. There are only a small number of restrictions left in place, said Mr Swann, who is isolating after testing positive for coronavirus, in his statement to the Assembly. In light of the current situation, and remembering the commitment that restrictions would only be in place as long as they are needed, I have decided that those remaining measures should no longer be set out in regulations. Instead, they should be placed in guidance to be followed by the public. I shall therefore be making an order on Tuesday, February  revoking the remaining restrictions and face-covering regulations. The relevant guidance will be updated.” He added that the changes do “not mean that Covid- has gone away or that we as a community are safe from its harm”. Mr Swann continued, “It is vitally important that we continue to observe the sensible measures we have all learnt to protect ourselves and others. Even with these powers in place however, it would almost certainly be impossible to introduce new restrictions in the absence of an Executive.

The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have. Thank you to every single person that has applied to work with us.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dcfebdaaafeae   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cecdeddacea   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
