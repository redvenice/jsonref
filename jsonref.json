She explains that after her husband lost his small Hermès diary, she managed to find a replacement on eBay, listed under “small vintage leather goods”. The diary arrived, almost a twin to the original, with the “same smooth leather, but redder, softer with a well-used sheen”. And there was another difference. In the address section, Benkemoun found telephone numbers, written in brown ink, for Breton, Brassaï, Braque, Balthus, Cocteau, Éluard… “the greatest postwar artists listed in alphabetical order”.Benkemoun describes herself as an “obsessive” sleuth and discovers that the 1951 diary belonged to Dora Maar, photographer, artist and Picasso’s mistress and model (subject of Weeping Woman). She decides to tell Maar’s story through her notable addressees and even includes, charmingly, Maar’s plumber (he installed a bathtub for Picasso).It is a brilliant idea but – if the word can be used in this context – marred. The problem is that the subject arrived by chance, a biographer’s blind date (who knew eBay could deliver book ideas?). Benkemoun had no pre-existing interest in Maar and is disturbed to discover that she swung to the right in old age and kept Mein Kampf on her bookshelf. She considers abandoning her subject. What she does not do is to consider in any depth Maar’s precarious mental health. She describes a first meeting with Picasso in which Maar, wearing black gloves embroidered with small flowers, repeatedly dropped a knife between her fingers until her blood flowed: “Picasso was overwhelmed, enthralled. A psychiatrist might have been wary of this form of self-mutilation.” Benkemoun should have been warier, too – and more curious. Nor is she much interested in Maar’s photography. Her book is glitteringly anecdotal. It scores as artistic pickpocketing – unauthorised rummaging. But she misses altogether the melancholy fact that what her husband now possesses is the address book of a recluse, the contacts of a woman who lost touch with the world.• Finding Dora Maar: An Artist, An Address Book, A Life by Brigitte Benkemoun (translated by Jody Gladding) is published by Getty (£18.99).

Waves of shop closures in 2019 have been followed by a string of collapses during and since lockdown, with the result of thousands of job losses.Mark Robinson, chair of the High Streets Task Force, said high numbers of office workers were important for retailers. “The most successful places for retail have the most people working there as well – so having lots of people coming into work for councils, offices, and other employers is good for high streets,” he said. “We need to encourage more people to work in our town centres.”In several large towns and cities, students make up more than a quarter of those residents, which means if they do not return to university in the autumn, high streets could see lower footfall.Matthew Williams, a director at PwC who works with the taskforce, said the report provided “some clues that Covid is a catalyst for change that was already happening”.Last week PwC published a study of how four areas had coped since lockdown loosened, which showed that while Windsor and Cleethorpes had seen footfall bounce back, recovery was slower in Manchester and Ashford in Kent.“Not all the changes will be the same. What we’ve started to see is a ergence of what is happening in different towns and on different high streets,” Williams said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b69c2f2b6c2e6bd6a2b0c914129d2be91fb6884b/0_666_4234_2539/master/4234.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=294b0ebc295a5b1465ab83a333dc65d5","title":"sunaks stamp duty holiday behind surge in home buyer interest","story":"Demand for all UK property is up, but price range reflects chancellor’s £500,000 limitThe number of buyers looking for homes has surged in the month since the chancellor announced a stamp duty holiday, with demand for properties costing between £500,000 and £750,000 showing the biggest uptick, according to figures from the UK’s largest estate agency chain.The stamp duty cut, which was announced by Rishi Sunak as part of a package of measures to support jobs, means anyone spending more than £500,000 on a property is set to save £15,000 if they buy before 31 March next year.The move only applied to sales in England and Northern Ireland, but was followed by changes in Wales and Scotland which increased the tax-free threshold in those parts of the UK to £250,000.The housing market had already started to move after lockdown, but immediately after the chancellor made his statement, estate agents reported that phones were “ringing off the hook”, while property websites reported a rush of page views.Hamptons International’s analysis of data from more than 700 branches owned by its parent company Countrywide suggests much of the initial flurry of interest has translated into serious property searches.Aneisha Beveridge, the head of research at Hamptons International, said the stamp duty holiday had boosted the market, but the impact of lockdown should also be considered as it could be driving demand for homes outside cities.“The number of people looking to buy a home has risen across every region in Great Britain since the announcement, with southern areas recording the biggest increase,” she said. “It’s in these regions, where house prices tend to be higher, that buyers stand to gain the most from the holiday.”She added: “With space topping buyers’ wish lists, demand for homes in the suburbs and country locations has increased the most, and it’s these homes that are most likely to sell above their asking price.“Over the last decade house prices in cities have risen more than twice as much as those in the country, so this trend may mean the gap between city and country house prices will begin to close.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d2d57858ac69ba92ab5c20a7b6cb5d931020474/0_41_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76e90fbd07c77e7ac6d344d0ddecc39d","title":"covid 19 eat out to help out used 10m times in schemes first week","story":"UK diners quick to adopt Treasury’s plan to help hospitality industry stay afloat during Covid-19 crisisDiners across the UK used the government’s eat out to help out scheme more than 10.5m times in its first week, the Treasury said.HMRC said it had received claims for 10,540,394 “covers”, or inidual meals, from businesses under the scheme as of 9 August. A couple out having dinner together under the scheme would count as two covers.The average claim was close to £5, which means the scheme cost around £50m in its first week. The Treasury has set aside £500m to fund the initiative.Rishi Sunak launched eat out out help out to help the struggling hospitality industry, and described the uptake as “amazing”.“Britons are eating out to help out in big numbers. And they aren’t just getting a great deal – they’re supporting the almost 2 million people employed in this sector,” the chancellor said.“These amazing figures show that our plan for jobs is delivering.”HMRC said 83,068 restaurants had signed up to the scheme. They range from independent cafes, pubs and restaurants to mainstream chains such as McDonald’s, KFC and Toby Carvery, and include Michelin-starred restaurants.The half-price meal offer appears to have benefited retailers, which have also been hit hard by the pandemic.

In a sign of shoppers returning to the high street and ramping up spending online, separate figures from Barclaycard – Britain’s biggest credit card provider – also revealed a bounce-back in overall consumer spending.The release of pent up-demand in July fuelled a rise in food and drink spending in particular, according to both surveys, while spending in sports and outdoor stores rose sharply as the warm weather encouraged more people to spend time outside.Hairdressers, nail bars and beauty salons starting to reopen their doors after four months of enforced closure lifted spending, while furniture stores and electronics retailers reported their strongest figures this year.Despite signs of a recovery taking hold, many shops continued to struggle, with many people still reluctant to go out and office workers continuing to work from home.Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said September would prove the real test for consumer spending and the strength of Britain’s economic recovery, in a month when spending typically rises after the end of the holiday season and when adults spend money on their children returning to school.“With the furlough scheme unwinding and wider economic uncertainty set for the autumn, consumer anxiety will likely rise along with it. This will place more scrutiny on disposable income and make life even tougher for retailers,” he said.Following the non-essential retail lockdown and continued weak levels of demand at some stores, growing numbers of retailers are announcing job cuts and shop closures across the country – including at major high street brands such as Boots, John Lewis and Marks and Spencer.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said: “While the rise in retail sales is a step in the right direction, the industry is still trying to catch up lost ground, with most shops having suffered months of closures.“The fragile economic situation continues to bear down on consumer confidence, with some retailers hanging by only a thread in the face of rising costs and lower sales.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c010694016109ad43f75020a85aad817ffda634/286_196_4642_2786/master/4642.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da78cf7cf45fa231ca60b931f20c7842","title":"belarus alexander lukashenko presidential elections","story":"The implausible results of Sunday’s presidential elections have triggered a pushback like never beforeFrom the residential area of Minsk where I’m writing, I can hear the incessant honking of car horns. The sound marks the expression of popular protest in the Belarusian capital against Alexander Lukashenko, and his desire to stay in power and add one more presidential term to his already 26-year rule.Tens of thousands gathered on the streets of Minsk, united by a simple slogan: “Leave!” In response, the siloviki – the special state security forces – violently dispersed the crowds, resulting in around 3,000 people being detained and hundreds injured. What is particularly remarkable is that protests took place all over the country. This is not the uprising of some narrow or unrepresentative liberal group.The internet has also been blocked for the second day in a row even with workarounds, like VPNs, it barely works. (This happened before in 2010 on election night and sporadically during the 2020 electoral campaign.) As of Monday afternoon, the protesters, many of whom rely on information from the encrypted Telegram app, were still intending to take to the streets again. Moments of connectivity brought Telegram reports that additional military trucks and equipment are being brought to the city.Lukashenko’s plan to stay in power is crumbling. In a recent address to the nation, he proclaimed that he “won’t give the country away”. With multiple violations of democratic standards and human rights committed during his reign – such as the unconstitutional referendum that allowed Lukashenko to run for president for an unlimited number of terms, the disappearance of opponents in the 1990s, the imprisonment of those who dared to question his authority – he and his government understand that if he leaves now, the prosecution of past deeds might follow. People would be free to pore over the past 26 years. The regime is in survival mode: they are determined to suppress discontent, even at the cost of spilling blood on the streets.Although Lukashenko has a strong hold on the repressive apparatus of the state – as the spectacle of siloviki bundling unarmed protesters into the backs of vans in broad daylight signals – and maintains leverage over the employees in the state sector who work on the electoral commissions, there are signs of cracks inside the system.There were reports indicating that police showed up last night at some of the polling stations, forcing the commissions to report the “correct” results. In addition, although many of the siloviki present on the streets yesterday did attack protesters, some refused to take part. Such developments are unprecedented.Another source of inspiration for the protesters and those people who oppose the regime from inside the system (electoral commissions and the police), is the growing consolidation of the civil society. Belarusians – those inside the country and the Belarusian diaspora all over the world – have already reached into their pockets to crowdfund money to assist those who have been repressed and detained. We are at a turning point. Lukashenko has little option other than to cling to power, which makes the possibility of more state violence against his own people likely. At the same time, this level of popular protest against the intolerability of life under Lukashenko has never happened before. Even if he manages to suppress the protests in the coming days, Belarusian society has awoken to a freedom struggle that will not go away any time soon.• Katsiaryna Shmatsina is a research fellow at the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93379ba9201b0b7a90555c5fc030b22a54ca3774/301_393_3955_2374/master/3955.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a31f851cde08348498e960b636dc869d","title":"guardianwitness send us a story","story":"You can send a news tip direct to  journalists here.

They casually dish out hugs, wipe tears and help blow snotty noses, all without any hint of anxiety or signs of protection. These people work in children’s nurseries.I found it so strange to see people, as a matter of routine, put aside the messages coming out of press conferences around the world about the risks of being in close contact with others. It’s something they have to do each time they pick up and hug a crying and blubbering child. They don’t reach for masks and gloves, but for the kids instead.Leaving the outside world full of people in masks and gloves dodging each other on buses and in shops, ever vigilant of their own personal buffer zones, and coming into the local authority-funded nursery is like going back in time to when other people weren’t a mortal danger to us all.But they tell me it has to be this way. Without normality and contact and support, the children will suffer. Just as plants need water and sunshine, children need a loving and caring environment. As the Harlow experiment from the 1950s and 60s showed, primate infants will forgo food for care and contact, and whether the people in the nurseries know of this experiment or not, they are all convinced that without care and contact the children will suffer.They are so sure of this that they are willing to place themselves in harm’s way. Of course they take precautions, such as constantly cleaning, but you’re fooling no one when you pick up a blubbing child that then tries to bury itself into your neck.These people’s radiant beliefs are so tangential to those that result in empty clapping outside No 10 that I find it almost hard to find my bearings, until I’m back on the streets and surrounded by sideways glances once more.“I’ll be honest, at first, it was quite frightening. I’m sure we’d all like to stay at home and keep safe, but that’s just not the way the whole world works. I’d imagine the parents that have to go to work too, and how they feel leaving their children. It’s so important for their day at work, that they know that their children are safe and happy at nursery. I’m a mum, and I’m a key worker, and that for me would mean everything.“I imagine that they’re going to work every day frightened – will they get ill, what will happen to their child, how are they going to keep the roof over their heads? And so allI could do is come into work myself and put my best foot forward, thinking if we can make their children’s life a little bit better, it’ll make their day a lot better too. At least they know that their child is safe. And so I just thought, come on, you know? My son’s safe, he’s out of harm’s way. And as long as I keep myself well, I can keep on doing what we’re supposed to be doing.“But I also wanted to show my son a good role model: that through tough times, through uncertain times, I can still get up and be positive, and bring a little bit of positivity to the children here in the nursery too, because they don’t really understand what’s going on. It’s quite frightening for them – the world’s changed all of a sudden in their eyes. So I just thought, I’m a mum, come here to the nursery and let the children’s parents know that they’re in safe hands – that was my everyday get-up-and-go thought.”“Kids require contact because they need the reassurance that that brings. You’ve got to understand that these are very young children, and they’re still very vulnerable. They need to feel like they’re in a secure and safe environment, and so you have to show them that kind of love. It’s just not possible to stand 2 metres away from them, wearing a facemask and gloves. Your face is one of the primary ways in which you communicate with a young child, especially as a lot of the time their language isn’t there yet.“If we’re treating the children differently from how we did before this whole situation – if we were not giving them cuddles, if we were not being attentive to their needs, if we were not in close proximity with them – then they’ll pick up on that, and we’ll have a bigger problem because the children won’t feel safe and secure.“To be honest, it didn’t really bother me being in close proximity with others while everyone else in the country wasn’t, because I know what this job entails. To do it properly, you need to have that tactile environment, and so there’s no point in saying I’m not going to do X, Y and Z. You’ve just got to get on with it.“We’re not doing anything different now, we’re still doing what we were doing in January, in November and last summer, and that is to provide children with a really stimulating, loving and caring environment in which they can flourish. It’s as necessary for a child as sunshine and water is for a plant.”“With Covid, we are much more thorough with the cleaning. Previously we’d clean the toys, tables, door handles and surfaces probably twice a day, but now it’s every 30 minutes. That’s a major, major difference, and it’s taking up much more of our time.“Another is splitting the rooms. So for example, the toddler room now has no more than 10 children, although before it was more like 20. And it’s going to be an ongoing challenge because we’ll need a lot more staff to be in different areas. And even a lot more rooms.“I think everyone needs to understand that with children it’s not possible to social distance. They don’t understand, and you can’t just tell them ‘don’t hug your friend’ or ‘don’t go near your friend’ – that would just create an atmosphere that’s really negative for the children. On the one hand, you’re aiming for everything to be as normal as possible, but at the same time we have a duty to ensure that the environment is safe and that we’re following the guidelines that are set out by the government, though much of that is confused. “The management here are trying their best with the information that they’re being given by the government, but so much of that doesn’t seem to take into consideration that every centre is different, and that they can’t all just adapt and do all of these things that they’re telling us to do. It’s just not possible. For this reason, I think that the way we’re currently working is just not sustainable.“Before we had a much closer type of communication with the parents. They could actually come into the centre’s classroom and directly drop their children into the room, and see them go off and play with their friends, whereas now we just straight away take them from their parents and take them into the room ourselves. And at pickup we have to take the child to the entrance to meet their parents, and if you’re trying to give feedback to, say, five parents, it’s a little bit awkward and rushed, and so the parents might feel like they’re not really as involved in the centre as they were before. They don’t actually know what’s going on behind closed doors, and they don’t see the beneficial changes that we’ve made.“Because of the fear and anxiety of parents, some of the children might not come back to school. It is a worry for me, especially as a practitioner, knowing that some children are going to be left without an education, especially those children who are vulnerable and who need more of a push than other children. To accept that as a reality, is quite disheartening.”“These children’s parents are working on Covid wards, they’re GPs having to do emergency appointments, they’re seeing people face to face, and when they’ve finished their shift they’re coming to us. We open that gate, and what do they want to see? A child with a smiley face, that’s really tired and has had a really great day. The kids pick up on the slightest thing, so if you’re stressed you’ve got to turn it on. You want their journey through Covid to be as positive and happy as it could be.“I do think that there are some people, including myself at times, who have been in quite a fragile state of mind. I’m exhausted, more so than I ever have been, because you’re using your nervous energy. You’ve got worries as well, so you don’t sleep as well as sometimes.“When I get back home I’m exhausted. I use the buses as I don’t drive. And then it’s wash your hands, take your clothes off, have a shower – and I make sure and I’m wiping down everything in my home too, so it’s not just your shift here. But you do feel a sense of achievement, and I do feel that you need to have that, in order to go home, rest, eat some nice food, have a glass of wine and then come back the next day.”“The age group that I work with are too small to understand anything to do with Covid. Some of them don’t even speak yet. And when a baby cries, you can’t just leave them crying over there with you watching. They’re babies, we can’t do that. Even with the older children, when they come for a hug, you can’t just tell them to keep a distance.“It was weird in the beginning because, despite what I said about hugging the children, those children are coming from outside and we don’t know where they have been or whether they’ve had contact with anyone else, and so of course it was worrying to be at work and then go home and see my family, my two children and my husband, after that. But I can’t just tell a child to stay away from me. I can’t do that. They’re too small, they don’t understand that and they aren’t gonna get it.“In the classroom, we’ve had to remove everything like rugs, soft toys, blankets, Lego, books – everything. And the toys which we have kept on our floor, we have to spray them every single day to wash them and make them ready for the next day. So we make sure we spray everything, which is a lot more work, and you have to do it every day for them because they do touch it, in fact everybody touches it, or maybe they put in their mouths. So I make sure it’s nice and clean for them as well. They need it done for them.”“At first the pandemic was scary, but we have to face it. I think that if it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be. You can’t lock the door and stay away from it. And if you accept it, it’s not difficult. Then you don’t feel like you’re scared or vulnerable.“The first two weeks, I didn’t go out as I was off from work. And then, when I did go out, my eyes were hurting from the sun as it was so bright. And so from that day I said I’m not going to stay inside all the time because it’s not good – not for your brain, for your body, or for everything else.“Some children here are coming from other nurseries, and that transition for them is very difficult. You need to make them both come here and be happy, all at the same time. It’s easy to put pressure on yourself, but when you do, the children get pressure as well. So first, the adults have to become calm, to get nice and smooth, and then the children will be too.“Without contact, it’s no good for them. It’s no good because children, when they play, they talk and move, and their brain and emotions develop. When they communicate with friends, they pick up speech. When they move, they become strong. So we just have to be calm, and then do as normal.”“This is the foundational stage for the child, one where they start to develop, and if they miss something there can be under-development. It’s important that they create a bond with people, with significant others, and with the people next to them. And if you are distant, you cannot create this bond. Instead you will disconnect with the child.“Children like to play, and if I say to them ‘no, no, don’t come to me,’ the child can look at me confused and ask ‘why don’t you want me? Yesterday you were playing with me, but today you won’t play with me?’ It’s very important for them to have continuous care and continuing provision, both educationally and emotionally, and if you’re far away from them, you lose this connection.“Without this, a child might start to cry, become very quiet or withdraw. If this happens at this age it could have a detrimental effect on the child, educationally and emotionally. But I think, in my personal opinion, the effect is more emotional, because at this stage the child needs this emotional support, and this attachment, to develop a better foundation.”“I’ve been at this nursery for 30 years, and in that time I would say this is the biggest challenge I’ve had to face, because it’s unlike anything we’ve ever known before. Friday was the announcement you’re going to close, and Monday we were back open just for vulnerable children and the children of key workers, all from different places.“So the phone started ringing and the referrals started to come in. I think the challenges were: how do these children adjust to new environments? What could we do to make sure that they had a good transition, to reassure parents from home, and send out messages and activities to them? We were really, really busy, with a small skeleton team. Myself and Fiona, the deputy manager, have worked really closely with Nick from Haringey council, and that’s been really instrumental in terms of advice and support.“I don’t think we have come up for air yet. Every day brings a different challenge. You come in and something’s changed, for example more calls for places for children whose families are key workers.“Previously we were offering places to 130 families, and now we’re accommodating 77 families, which is a lot of children in this environment. We’re working at a high percentage. But there are families staying at home who are not now having that face-to-face contact, and are not having their issues resolved quickly. Like before, a parent would come up and say: ‘Can I speak to you for a minute?’ And I would always make time. I’d have a little conversation, share a few techniques, and within two or three weeks that stress is over. But now it’s very different, which is a worry.“In general, looking at the national picture, I’m very worried, and not just educationally. By only staying home, children’s socialising and wellbeing is compromised.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6f4afe873579eee00c1dc54fb66212963a7a104/0_328_4946_2969/master/4946.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f79641096e162b15474486ffc8a8e370","title":"undergraduate students what plans do you have for freshers week","story":"If you are set to begin an undergraduate course in the UK this autumn, we would like to hear from youWith nightclubs closed and social distancing measures in place at hospitality venues – including pubs – across the UK, freshers’ week is likely to be a toned down affair for first-year university students in September.Many universities have set their sights on virtual events such as remote freshers fairs and Zoom comedy nights as a way to welcome young people to campus life, while parties in halls are likely to be banned.

The university, at the behest of the business interests that dominated its governing council, was apparently spying on its lecturers and students and keeping files on their political activities.Among the targets was Prof David Montgomery, one of America’s most distinguished labour historians, then a visiting professor at Warwick. When he addressed Coventry Labour party, the legal adviser and security officer at Rootes Motors, one of the young university’s biggest backers, attended the meeting and reported to the university authorities. Montgomery, they wrote, “revealed a definite bias against employers” and “most likely” would “exhibit a similar bias” in university lectures, exposing students “to a most undesirable indoctrination”.The revelations caused a nationwide storm. Within days, students across the country held sit-ins, demanding that universities open any personal files held on them. Penguin rushed out a book called Warwick University Ltd: industry, management and the universities. Its editor, the Warwick history professor EP Thompson, said the university had forged a “subordinate relationship with industrial capitalism”.Today every university operates as a business, making its living in a globalised marketplace. Every university has remodelled its governing bodies along corporate lines. Every university gets most of its income from private sources. Paradoxically, every university is also, mainly through the funding agencies and their “quality” indicators, subject to a degree of state control that would have been unthinkable 50 years ago.As Roger Brown, former vice-chancellor of Southampton Solent University and co-author of Everything for Sale (2013), has observed, markets are normally seen to need less state regulation while “in higher education they are seen to need more”.The extent of regulation by the UK state is a legitimate subject for debate. So, indeed, is the extent of British industry’s involvement with universities. Influence from foreign companies and foreign states is a different matter, and you don’t need to be a xenophobe to think so.In recent years, concerns have occasionally emerged about normal academic processes being compromised to protect university income. In 2014, for example, the University of Bedfordshire was accused of bending its rules to allow students sponsored by the Saudi Arabian government to retake an exam three times. But the benefit of a market is supposedly that, if one source of income asks for special favours, you tell it to get lost and you find another.In the past few years, however, the situation has changed dramatically. A single source of income has become so important that its loss could spell financial disaster for at least a dozen leading UK universities. That source is China. And China is an authoritarian state that controls not only its leading companies but also, in large measure, the behaviour of its citizens.In welcoming whatever custom they can get from China, universities are doing what the rules of the higher education market demand. They also have sound academic reasons for collaborating with a country that is increasingly at the forefront of research, particularly in the sciences. Unfortunately, China does not play by what are generally understood as market rules. Still less does it accept the practices of disinterested and dispassionate academic inquiry to which British universities still try to cling, if less tenaciously than they once did.If you want proof of that, read a document approved by the ruling Chinese communist party congress in 2013. It was secret but translations are available. “We must … allow absolutely no opportunity or outlets for incorrect thinking or viewpoints,” the document states. It explicitly rejects western concepts of civil society and universal values.China doesn’t believe that knowledge, particularly in the social sciences, should be pursued for its own sake. The goal, as Exeter University’s Catherine Owen, a politics specialist who speaks Mandarin, told the Commons foreign affairs committee last year, is “to promote social harmony and advance the government’s vision of social and economic development”.The relationship between UK universities and China doesn’t stop there. Liverpool and Nottingham both have campuses in China. Cambridge has a Chong Hua professorship in development studies, endowed with £3.7m from a charity controlled by the family of a former Chinese prime minister. Jesus College, Cambridge, has accepted funding from Chinese sources for its China Centre. At least 10 UK university laboratories depend on significant investment from Chinese defence firms.China is the UK’s third most important research partner. In 2018, UK researchers published 14,763 papers co-authored with Chinese researchers, some of them partly financed by the Huawei company, which the government now regards as too close to the Chinese state to be trusted with helping to build the UK’s 5G network.About 500 Chinese military scientists have spent time at British universities in the past decade, working on technologies linked to missiles, supercomputers and jet aircraft. GCHQ has warned universities about “hostile state actors” trying “to steal personal data, research data and intellectual property”.These are just a few examples we know about. As the Onward thinktank notes, UK universities aren’t always transparent about their funding sources. For example, Bristol refused to reveal details of funding for a five-year internet research project lest it lead to the sponsors’ withdrawal and “hamper the ability to win future research funds”. As for spying, the Chinese embassy, it is alleged, routinely keeps tabs on the country’s UK students.Fifty years after the Warwick scandal, it’s not lefty students but Tory MPs and thinktanks and rightwing papers such as the  – always eager to find reds under the bed – who warn of the dangers of UK universities’ links to China. Their focus is on security and censorship risks and they quote evidence of Chinese pressure to prevent sensitive subjects such as Taiwan, Tibet, the Uighur Muslims, Tiananmen Square and civil rights in Hong Kong being discussed on UK campuses.Some of this may be scaremongering. But academic freedom is precious and fragile. Just as the young Warwick University, in its anxiety to establish itself, laid itself open to interference from illiberal industrialists, so now some of our most prestigious universities, in their anxiety to succeed in the global marketplace, have become sitting ducks for an illiberal state.The coronavirus pandemic already threatens the continued flow of Chinese students to the UK, with possibly ruinous consequences for some top universities. But if relations between the UK and China worsen, China could order a boycott of higher education in the UK, as it has already done in Taiwan and threatened in Australia. The Tories, who like to think of themselves as s of national security and independence, could find their marketisation policies blowing up in their faces."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cc15c54303d73154b86eae2a4ee7ccfad57d706/0_178_5349_3209/master/5349.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=c4488ec7252e346294daf2c10cccbd04","title":"we love fashion fixes for the week ahead in pictures","story":"Mother Denim launch new Aura collection, plus beach towels made from recycled plastic bottles, and slippers built to last"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3cacfd18f84a42c249e11145a5376e640f85887/0_93_4453_2672/master/4453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d8588b770a8ac825f8921ed0ee43230","title":"liverpool complete signing of kostas tsimikas on a five year contract","story":"Liverpool have completed the signing of the left-back Kostas Tsimikas from Olympiakos, with the 24-year-old Greece international moving to the Premier League champions on a five-year contract and for a fee believed to be in the region of £11.75m.Tsimikas, who has three caps for Greece and made 86 appearances for Olympiakos, will serve as a back-up to Andrew Robertson and fill a problem position for Jürgen Klopp, who for some time has deployed James Milner as a fill-in for Robertson whenever the Scotland captain has been absent.“We have watched Kostas for a long time and are really happy that he has joined us,” said Klopp. “He is a very good footballer with an attitude to win and to compete, and I really like his mentality.

They are travelling across the Channel on a magic carpet that can take only two people at a time. So, in order for everyone to get across there will need to be 9 trips in total from their starting point in England: 5 across carrying two people, and 4 returning carrying one person. (Magic carpets cannot fly empty, which is why one person needs to travel back. All the friends are able to fly alone on the carpet if need be.)The faster the carpet flies, the bumpier the ride. Babs can fly at a speed that gets her to France in 1 minute. Charles feels queasy at that speed: his maximum speed gets him to France in 5 minutes. The others can get to France without suffering debilitating travel sickness no faster than 6 mins (Hattie), 7 mins (Joan), 8 mins (Kenneth) and 12 mins (Sid).1. What is the least amount of flying time, in minutes, required to get everyone from England to France without anyone suffering from queasiness? (When two people are on the carpet together, the crossing will take as long as it takes the slowest of the two.)Perhaps the most obvious strategy is for Babs, who can travel fastest, to take everyone over one by one, returning by herself, since she will save everyone time on the return journey.If she does this, she takes 5 min with Charles, and 6, 7, 8 and 12 mins with the others. Her total time in minutes is thus 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 12 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1  42. This is indeed the best strategy with the given times in the question.2. Let’s say that the friends’ tolerance for travel-sickness means that their fastest journeys take the following times: Babs (1 minute), Charles (3 mins), Hattie (7 mins), Joan (9 mins), Kenneth (11 mins) and Sid (13 mins).If you tried the above strategy of Babs taking everyone over one by one, the total time would now be:This is not the best strategy any more. You know this because I told you that all the friends can get to France in less than the answer to question 1, which is 42 minutes. So we need to look for a better strategy.The insight here is that the slowcoaches must go over together. If Sid will take 13 minutes, much better for Kenneth to go with him, which avoids the need for another traverse to take 11 minutes. So let’s put Sid and Kenneth on the same ride.However, if Sid and Kenneth go on the first traverse, one of them will have to return to pick up someone else, which rather defeats the object. So let the fastest two go over first, leaving someone there to return with the carpet once Sid and Kenneth get there. In other words:Step 1. Babs and Charles go over. Charles stays in France and Babs returns: 3 + 1  4 minsStep 2: Kenneth and Sid go over, and Charles returns: 13 + 3  16 mins.Step 3: Babs and Charles go over again, and Babs returns: 4 mins.Step 4: Hattie and Joan go over, and Charles returns: 9 + 3  12 minsStep 5: Babs and Charles go over: 3 mins.If you used the ‘slowcoaches together’ strategy for Q1, the total time would have been 46 minutes. So that strategy is not always the best one.I hope you enjoyed today’s puzzle. I’ll be back in two weeks.I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles.

It had lain idle and fallen into disrepair over a number of years. It is the only track of its kind in the north of England and attracted a Covid-19-limited capacity of 100 competitors and 500 spectators for its first event, entitled Dragtastic, on the weekend of 8 August 2020.The fundraising effort and venue revamp was organised under the auspices of Straightliners, the West Yorkshire-based motorsport event organiser and club which tapped into its thousands of followers on social media. The revamp involved a complete resurface of the drag strip.The prestigious track was set-up in the late 1970s as York Raceway by the Murty family, who organised drag racing events for decades. It isa well-loved drag strip that has played a part in so many racers and enthusiasts lives. It became the north of England’s premier drag racing venue and generations of families have come here to test their nerve and machines. Unfortunately, Melbourne Raceway closed down in 2017, a heartbreaking development for the motorsport community.The relaunch of Melbourne Raceway is the next chapter in motorsport history in the north of England. The community came together and saved this iconic venue, once again reborn to live another day.Competing side by side in a two-lane raceway, the racers take off from a standing start after dramatic tyre burnouts and the first past the finish line wins. All runs are electronically timed under the auspices of the UK Timing Association (UKTA), with competitors receiving a personal performance print-out showing their times and speeds.Event organiser and founder of Straightliners, Trevor Duckworth, thanked everyone for their fundraising effortsand help in order to getting the eighth-of-a-mile track ready for the event. “It’s new tarmac, drivers,” he said at the start. “Don’t expect super fast times today. We need to lay down some rubber and get it going,” he said referring to the practice of heating up the tyres on the start pad. This makes the vehicle tyres grip and perform better but over time it makes the track grippier and therefore faster. As the first event got under way and rubber was laid, Duckworth said: “I had a dream and it’s now very much a reality. Melbourne Raceway lives and it’s time to create new memories and inspire the next generation of racer and teams.”Mark Flavell’s Funny Car 7.8 litre recorded the fastest time of the day powering down thetrack in 5.41 seconds.One of the big draws at the event was Force of Nature, a steam-powered rocket motorcycle designed, built (with the help of others) and ridden by Graham Sykes from north Yorkshire and powered solely by steam. Built for drag racing, record breaking, exhibitions and events, it uses the latent energy of super-heated pressurised water released through de Laval nozzles, where it turns to steam and creates the thrust to propel the bike.Another big name attendee was Kevin Nicks, who holds the world record for fastest shed. Nicks was racing on his latest creation Barrow of Speed, which he built on a zero budget during the coronavirus lockdown.Duckworth said: “I had a dream. It’s now very much a reality. We have had some very unexpected hurdles but we prevailed and I can honestly say this is something remarkable. Melbourne Raceway lives. It’s almost time to create new memories and to inspire the next generation of racers and teams, who knows what the future holds? But I can tell you this: we surpassed expectations in many ways, and you have all done me proud. Long live Melbourne Raceway.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/512a08d8d8c897cb05187a90b5aaa0ba8cc86b55/0_42_4437_2663/master/4437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2dcb43b5aa17fc87ee83e374554a9be0","title":"innocent fun joe root lost burdens of england captaincy","story":"Perhaps it was inevitable that in being a leader, an ambassador, an entertainer and a salesman, something had to giveThree years ago, I went to Sheffield to interview Joe Root. It was his first summer as England captain and as he parsed his way through a series of solemn, proportionate answers about New Responsibilities and Exciting Opportunities, I became increasingly fascinated by his demeanour. His posture was nervous and awkward his gestures self-conscious and uncertain his words stilted and punctuated by short involuntary intakes of breath. It seemed like Root still was still trying to work out whether the England captaincy was something into which you grow or shrink. Whether it bottles you up or sets you free.A couple of weeks later, someone in the England camp informed me Root had read my article and was a little put out. Not angry. Not upset. Just a bit surprised, as anyone might be if they’d seen their verbal tics and physical mannerisms deconstructed in creepily forensic detail in a national newspaper. Even so, Root’s reaction struck me as atypical. If this was his response to a largely innocuous slice of cod-psychology, how would he handle the merciless media roastings, the poison-pen campaigns, the barefaced lies to come? The England captaincy, after all, is hardly a job for someone who cares what other people think.Which, when you break it down, is a pretty appalling notion, isn’t it? This idea that in order to be an effective leader you need to shut your ears to the world. Think of all the dichotomies captaincy throws up – caution v boldness, indecision v stubbornness, sensitivity v emotional detachment – and then consider how the qualities we most revere in leaders are often those we least admire in people. To Root’s credit it is a dichotomy he has always rejected and now he appears to be proving it.At the turn of the year, with England 1-0 down in South Africa, Root was widely believed to be on borrowed time. Since which point: six Tests, six wins – he missed the recent first-Test defeat against West Indies being on paternity leave – and a side that for the first time feels like Root’s own: holistic, empathetic, fuelled by hard work and loyalty. Which makes it all the more anomalous that one player has remained stubbornly resistant to Root’s inspirational touch: himself.You’ve already seen the numbers: the anaemic conversion rate, the one century in 18 months. The idea of the “Big Four” in Test batting was always grounded more in myth than reality – ignoring AB de Villiers and Che Pujara at inception, Babar Azam and Marnus Labuschagne now – but, for the record, since ascending to the captaincy in 2017, Root averages 43 in Tests Kane Williamson 54 Virat Kohli 57, Steve Smith 69.And really, the broader picture here goes beyond statistics. What is missing is not runs or centuries but joy, expression, basic enjoyment. The young Root was a sheer pleasure to watch: a bouquet of abundant talent, sparkling freshness and life-affirming exuberance. The drives and the dabs, the carefree timing, the cheeky boyish grin: here was a player who seemed to encapsulate the sheer fun of being really good at cricket.These days the runs still occasionally come, but at some point in the past three years – somewhere in among the countless shifts between No 3 and No 4 like a Radiohead time signature, the technical modifications, the hailstorm collapses, the off-field crises, the sleepless nights – something important has been lost, diluted, dialled down. Somewhere along the way, we turned one of the great modern English batsmen into a pen-pushing middle-manager.I use the first person because the fault is not entirely Root’s own. It seems patently obvious with hindsight that Root was handed the England captaincy too soon: in his mid-20s, an age when we are still trying to discover who we are and what we want out of life. This is why Jimmy Anderson or Stuart Broad would have made more sense in the short term.Yet while being expected to maintain his stratospherically high standards in an era where the three formats were irrevocably breaking apart, Root would now also be asked to turn around an ailing team with a wildly uneven player pool, a hands-off coach, a relentless media and a punishing schedule. Not only that, but as results began to veer wildly he would carry the can for a generation of neglect: the sport’s declining popularity, the inadequacy of the grassroots game as a talent nursery, English cricket’s depressing prioritisation of profit over reach. The only way Root has managed to surf these tides without completely imploding is because he is as exceptional a cricketer as he is a person.But perhaps it was inevitable that while being a leader and a mentor, an ambassador and an entertainer and a salesman, something had to give. And perhaps it was inevitable that it would be his batting, the one skill that requires not empathy and sensitivity but its polar opposite: the ability to bury yourself, to be an island, to leave behind earthly cares and float off somewhere else entirely.Perhaps this is the true way of all flesh in the end. Or perhaps this is a peculiarly English disease: this urge to burden and thrash our pristine talents as if they were new cars, to see how much strain they can take before they break (exhibit 2B: Jofra Archer). Whatever he goes on to achieve, Root will be remembered as one of the most significant figures in the modern English game and if there is a sadness there it is that he has done it all in spite of us: a player of such broad shoulders that we made him hold up the sky."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ec4e3abc90ea8f31d8d3395fb2cf7160098fcf8/0_0_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b527fa8f67a81362c593f034aa510dae","title":"italians do it better an expert guide to hosting an amalfi inspired dinner party","story":"Giulia Rhodes speaks to some in-the-know Italians about how stunning seafood and verdant produce can add a touch of the Amalfi coast to your next dinner partyFrom authors and actors to designers and directors, the glamorous set has long flocked to Italy’s Amalfi coast. And it’s not hard to see why.A film-set perfect 25-mile ribbon of mountainous coastline, its colourful villages, fragrant lemon groves and deep blue sea form a Unesco world heritage site.And as with all Italian regions, the local food and drink is inextricably tied to the culture which means that even if you can’t actually strut your stuff in Positano, you can cook up a bit of Italian sunshine in your kitchen.Alessandro Savelli is CEO and founder of UK-based Pasta Evangelists, which makes premium fresh pasta and sauces for home cooking – with next day delivery across the UK – in addition to its coveted concession in Harrods, now back open for business following the easing of lockdown restrictions.He learned to make pasta with his grandmother. Step one, he says, is to understand the culture. “I am Italian. I love food. I love pasta. I love cooking. Meals in Italy are when the family comes together to talk and enjoy delicious food. It is the highlight of our day. Food is not just seen as a necessity.”He celebrates the regional roots of Italian cuisine, sharing culture and stories to support local speciality pasta dishes. The food of the southern Italian Amalfi coast is different to that of his native Genoa, in the north, but it is close to his heart.“We go every year. My wife is from Naples and we married in Capri. I love it. The people are friendly, funny and loud, and the cuisine has everything – from amazing fish and seafood, fruits and vegetables to wonderful pizza and pasta. I discovered dishes that only really exist in that area.”His personal favourite is spaghetti alla nerano, with fried courgette and provolone cheese. While scialatielli – somewhere between linguine and tagliatelle in shape – with Amalfi lemon, ‘nduja sausage and mascarpone, features on the Pasta Evangelists’ Amalfi week menu.“Pasta dishes are about simplicity, freshness and few ingredients. We can bring that to your home,” he says. Although he admits he can’t deliver the full experience. “In Italy, we do tend to take the sunshine for granted.”Carla Bollati, a retired doctor from Turin, was introduced to the area around Amalfi by her late partner Gennaro, a Neapolitan. “I have a deep sentimental attachment,” she says. “And the tastes are a lovely way to travel to happy memories.”She was struck by the area’s scenery from her first visit. “It is a crowded landscape that cannot be changed. But there is also such special light and colour, the perfume of lemons, so many wonderful flavours. All the senses are covered.”The people and cuisine of the south are, she says, another huge draw. “They cook with what the area has to offer. Try a mozzarella there and you will understand what it is supposed to be.”Culinary roots and rules are revered, she adds. “If I cooked Neapolitan pasta e fagioli – with beans – for Gennaro, it had to be with broken odds and ends of pasta. Shells just wouldn’t be right. We Italians are so tied to the history of our food and the habit of coming together to eat it.”Italian food expert and cook, Paola Maggiulli, who runs the Tiny Italian supper clubs and cookery courses, agrees. But she insists it is a very inclusive tradition. To create an authentic Italian dinner, she says, the starting point is confidence.“Anyone can make Italian food. It is about flavour, not technique. With a few quality ingredients you can make incredible dishes.”Having spent much of her childhood in her father’s south London Italian deli, she recommends taking time to shop for good ingredients and learn the stories behind them.“In normal times, what is special about Italian food is the connection and time with other people. That might be planning the menu with friends or helping your grandmother prepare Sunday lunch for the extended family. Community and family are everything. Sharing the experience of eating with people you care about just makes you feel better.”So what would Maggiulli serve for a feelgood dinner inspired by the Amalfi coast?“I would want those incredible lemons,” she says, suggesting simple spaghetti with lemon, parmesan, olive oil and basil as a first course.“Amalfi seafood is beautiful, too. So perhaps a main of braised octopus, mussels cooked in white wine, or a frittura mista platter of fried squid and prawns,” she says. A chocolate and almond cake – a torta caprese after the island of Capri – would end the meal nicely.When you host your party, build the convivial atmosphere by serving the food on large dishes in the middle of the table, for guests to help themselves, and make sure the conversation, as well as the drinks, are flowing.For the latter, Daniele Umoette, former bar manager and drinks brand ambassador from Carpi in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna, suggests a gin spritz aperitif to kickstart the evening.“Mix blood orange flavoured Malfy Gin Con Arancia with Fever Tree Sicilian Lemon Tonic and a splash of prosecco over lots of ice in a nice glass, and garnish with some fruit such as blackberries, pink grapefruit slice and some aromatic herbs such as sage,” he says.Admittedly, your after-dinner stroll will probably be a little less glamorous than the nightly passeggiata in Positano. Maybe next year. Meanwhile, buon appetito.Malfy Gin is available to purchase in selected Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Asda, M\u0026ampS, Waitrose and Co-op stores, as well as Ocado and the Malfy Gin Amazon brand storePlease drink Malfy Gin responsibly.

In the early days it formed the basis of many a #quarantini – made from whatever we might have left in the cupboard. Since then, the hashtag has clocked up more than 87,000 posts and the term has passed into the popular lexicon. Now, take it a notch higher for the ultimate cocktail moment. With Malfy Gin, you can create the most authentic Italian style aperitivo hour. Try a Malfy Gin Rosa G\u0026ampT by mixing a measure of Malfy Gin Rosa with Mediterranean tonic in a copa glass over ice and garnishing with a pink grapefruit wheel. Or, for an added touch of sophistication, mix a measure of Malfy Gin Rosa with 50ml prosecco and 50ml San Pellegrino Arraciata Rossa over ice in a wine glass, and garnish with an orange wheel, strawberry slice and sprig of thyme to create a Amalfi Sunset Spritz.Front-room festivalsIf you missed glamping it up at Glasto or living it up at Latitude this summer, there’s nothing to stop you recreating that festival feeling right in your front room. This year, with staycations booming, boutique bell tents are all the rage, and whether you’re a Hyde Park regular, or head to the Isle of Wight every summer, you don’t have to miss out. Pitch your tent in the garden – or indoors if it’s raining – swing open the patio doors, pour yourself a Malfy Gin and tonic, and cue up your festival playlist. Designer wellies optional.UpcyclingNesting has taken on new meaning as we’re spending more time than ever at home, meaning that we are looking to make our personal spaces as cosy and reassuring as possible. With major home improvement projects put on hold, we’re looking at subtler ways to spruce up our living spaces, often going hand-in-hand with the crafts we’ve taken up to help while away our extended free time. Repurposing old units and reupholstering much-loved chairs are at the top of many DIY lists – and when it comes to themes and patterns, rainbows and bright, uplifting shades are the order of the day.Micro garden partiesWith our close friends and family having been out of bounds for so long, we’re getting to know the neighbours. WhatsApp groups for inidual streets and blocks of flats are springing up across the country as we look closer to home for friendship, support and entertainment.Scaled-down garden parties comprising small groups of neighbours dressing up and bringing over their own food and drinks – nibbled and sipped at a respectful distance – make for eclectic gatherings and unexpected new friendships being forged.Staying ‘in-in’Now we can no longer go “out-out” – and with loungewear fatigue firmly setting in – summer is about dressing up for virtual socialising. Many of us are seeing more of our friends than ever as we plan regular catch-ups via online video calling, from family quizzes to propping up a virtual bar with friends, while Royal Ascot 2020 saw thousands of us donning fascinators in front of the TV in aid of frontline charities. So as the weather warms up, it’s time to cast off your lockdown look and raise a glass of Malfy Gin in style.Locally sourced picnicsWith public transport still only used for essential travel and some of our favourite parks and gardens closed, we’re exploring the green spaces closer to home for a suitable patch of grass on which to spread our blankets.The best-dressed picnic baskets are filled with treats that support local producers, from honey collected by local beekeepers and veg from the farmer’s market, to unique small-batch cheeses and British charcuterie sliced on to artisanal sourdough. Explore your local high street to see what gems you can unearth.Home cooking with a little helpOnce we realised how much mess keeping a sourdough starter alive entails, the appeal of devoting ourselves to becoming expert home chefs faded fairly fast. With more food businesses pivoting to offer meal kits designed to be finished off at home for that personal touch, there’s no better time to start enjoying gourmet food delivered to your door (without worrying about it getting cold). For a taste of Italy, Pasta Evangelists offer artisan pasta and sauces via next-day delivery across the UK, which can be whipped up at home in minutes. With dishes inspired by culinary traditions found across Italy, from Venice to Sicily, you can be taken on a foodie journey with all the taste and minimum effort.Growing lupinsSince lockdown began, gardening has shot up in popularity, with garden centres opening some time before other non-essential businesses. From window sills to flower beds, this summer is about attempting to turn green spaces into a riot of colour to rival the rainbows pinned in people’s windows, and the West Country Lupin has been particularly popular. Packed with uplifting colour, lupins are easy to grow and soothing to look at, making them the ideal flower to plant this summer.Virtual destination toursGrounded globetrotters are fulfilling their wanderlust by taking virtual tours of some of the world’s most stunning spots. Choose from tours offering 360-degree views of popular destinations such as Tokyo or Machu Picchu, or watch a live stream from San Diego Zoo or California’s Monterey Bay Aquarium.You can even take a treadmill walk through the Colosseum – made even more authentic by concocting a refreshing gin spritz with Malfy Gin Rosa to take with you on your virtual tour.CottagecoreAnyone not ensconced in a countryside pad with an acre or two of garden attached is currently looking enviously towards the idyllic-looking lockdowns of those who are. As even the most ardent city-dweller wrests with sourdough starters and homemade crumpets, we’re being calmed by a trend that has been dubbed “cottagecore” – an aesthetic oozing with images of perfect-looking pies, vases filled with wildflowers and verdant countryside. Get the look by adding some floral frocks or shirts to your wardrobe.Malfy Gin is available to purchase in selected Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Asda, M\u0026ampS, Waitrose and Co-op stores, as well as Ocado and the Malfy Gin Amazon brand storePlease drink Malfy Gin responsibly.

Dr Mike Ryan, the head of the World Health Organization’s emergencies programme, alo said the virus had shown no seasonal pattern and governments in western Europe needed to react fast to new flare-ups to prevent it bouncing back.The Paris order applies to everyone aged 11 and over and covers places where physical distancing is difficult, including open-air markets, shopping streets and areas with large numbers of cafés and bars such as Rue Oberkampf and parts of the Marais.The city’s busiest boulevards and the pedestrianised banks of the Seine and the Canal St Martin, which are popular evening and weekend gathering places, are also included, as is Montmartre with its warren of narrow streets. More open areas such as the zone around the Eiffel Tower and Champs Élysées are not included.“The targets are basically places with a lot of people where it’s hard to keep more than a metre apart, and areas where people go to to relax, where distancing measures are being forgotten,” said Nicolas Nordman, a city hall safety official.He said people not wearing masks would be warned for the first few days, but that police would soon start handing out fines of €135 (£120). The zones where masks are obligatory will be evaluated regularly and could be expanded, he added.Several other French cities, including Lille, Nice and Biarritz, have adopted similar measures in recent days as the spread of Covid-19 has accelerated in several parts of France. France reported 2,288 infections in 24 hours on Friday and another 785 on Monday, bringing its weekly total of new cases to 10,800.Several European countries are experiencing a sharp increase in infections after easing strict lockdowns. In most, numbers remains significantly lower than during March and April, but Greece recorded 203 infections tests on Sunday, its highest figure since the start of the pandemic.Gkikas Magiorkinis, an assistant professor of hygiene and epidemiology at Athens University and one of the country’s top infectious disease experts, said Greece had reached a critical juncture in its ability to contain the further spread of the virus.“We can say that Greece has formally entered a second wave of the epidemic. This is the point that we could win or lose the battle,” he said, adding that cases could surge to 350 a day if the “dramatic increase” continued unabated.“Unless there is a change in the trend that we are seeing we are likely to propose more measures along the lines we have seen in Poros,” he said, referring to the island where a surge in cases late last week prompted authorities to announce an unprecedented crackdown including the closures of clubs, bars and restaurants from 11pm.The Greek health minister, Vassilis Kikilias, said transmission of the virus was “growing dangerously and hinted that further containment measures were likely to be announced.The country’s main concern was “the degree to which this epidemic can stretch any health system”, he said. “No health system, anywhere in the world, can cope effectively with a full epidemic resurgence.”While tourism was partly to blame, Magiorkinis attributed the recent Greek resurgence mostly to lax observance of hygiene protocols by Greeks, particularly younger generations who have flooded bars and beaches in recent weeks.The median age of an infected person within the last 30 days has fallen to 38, the Corriere della Sera paper reported, with a sharp increase in cases among those under 18. “Not being worried would be reckless,” the health minister, Roberto Speranza, told the paper. “The average age among those infected has dramatically fallen below 40.”There are currently 15 clusters of infections across Italy, including 14 friars in the Umbrian town of Assisi who recently arrived from overseas. The biggest outbreak, involving 257 people, has been among residents and staff at a migrant reception centre in Treviso, Veneto.Fresh outbreaks in north-east Spain continue to cause concern. Catalonia reported 863 new infections and five deaths in the past 24 hours and neighbouring Aragón recorded 633.New outbreaks have also been reported in Marbella and elsewhere on the Costa del Sol, and the Atlético de Madrid football team, who are due to travel to Lisbon for their Uefa Champions League quarter-final against RB Leipzig, also reported two cases.Despite the recent increase in infections in Spain, the WHO’s director of public health and environment, Maria Neira, said a new national lockdown would only be justified by a “very alarming” epidemiological scenario which she said “simply doesn’t exist”.Education authorities across Germany, meanwhile, where pupils in the states of Berlin, Brandenburg and Schleswig-Holstein returned to class on Monday, are ided over whether students should be required to wear masks during lessons.In four states, pupils and staff are required to wear masks only in corridors, common rooms, stairwells and canteens, while others – including Germany’s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, where secondary schools go back on Wednesday – have made masks compulsory everywhere on school grounds, including classrooms.Teachers’ unions have criticised the rules. “Starting schools with full classrooms can only be something other than a risky experiment if we are prepared to replace safety distances with other effective hygiene measures at schools,” said Heinz-Peter Meidinger, the head of the German Association of Teachers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd145cb5c7ebe4f2ff3c81910fd5f21f3daa0bd1/0_184_4853_2912/master/4853.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26846be36aa242b2374bfe16a5471c3d","title":"france on the cliff edge of removal from uk safe travel list","story":"Hundreds of thousands of British tourists face possible quarantine, industry figure suggestsFrance is “on the cliff-edge” of being removed from the UK’s travel corridor list, according to an industry figure, with a decision expected by the end of the week that could mean hundreds of thousands of Britons holidaying there would have to quarantine on their return.The country, which is the second most popular overseas holiday destination for Britons, recorded its highest Covid-19 surge since May on Friday, with 2,288 new cases. UK ministers are said to be closely monitoring the situation.Should data from the next two days confirm a continued rise in cases, France’s current exemption from quarantine restrictions is likely to end, meaning UK arrivals who have been there recently would again have to self-isolate for 14 days.The list of approved countries is typically reviewed at the end of each week – with a decision announced on Thursday or Friday – but Downing Street warned it would “act very rapidly” to impose fresh restrictions on countries if necessary.Travel firms were bracing for a “further shockwave”, according to Paul Charles, a consultant and spokesman for the Quash Quarantine campaign, who urged consumers to continue making plans to travel regardless of the uncertainty.Charles said that on a key benchmark, infection rates published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, France had already surpassed the level he claimed Whitehall deemed safe.He said France appeared on a similar trajectory to Spain – which was abruptly removed from the Department for Transport’s safe list last month. As of Monday, the 14-day cumulative number of Covid-19 cases in France was 26 per 100,000 people.Charles said: “They are seeing it in France the surge wasn’t strong enough last week, but it is on a cliff-edge at the moment. Unless they can demonstrate they can keep a lid on the numbers, based on the latest data it’s not looking good at all – nor in Malta, Netherlands or Switzerland.”He added that he hoped that ministers had “learned their lesson from Spain and would give people notice”, following the 30-hour grace period when 14-day quarantine restrictions were imposed on returnees from Belgium last week.Asked whether quarantine restrictions would be imposed on arrivals from France later this week, the prime minister’s official spokesman said on Monday: “We keep the data for all countries and territories under constant review. Any decisions to update the exemption list will be informed by the latest health data, and we can and will act rapidly if we judge that the public health risk not requiring travellers to self-isolate increases beyond an acceptable level.”He said the exemptions list had been updated on a weekly basis to reflect the international health picture, but added: “If there is a need to act very rapidly in order to protect public health, then we wouldn’t hesitate to do so.”Speaking during a visit to a school on Monday, Boris Johnson echoed the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s message last week that the government would “not hesitate” to impose quarantine restrictions.Government decisions on which countries are removed from the travel corridor list are informed by a risk assessment from the Joint Biosecurity Centre, which looks not only at infection rates but other factors including testing capacity, assessment of the quality of data available, trends in incidence and deaths, as well as transmission status.Labour called for more transparency over how quarantine decisions were made, including publishing all the scientific background. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said: “This transparency is vital if people are to have faith over how decisions are being made. Ministers also need to bring forward sector-specific support for those industries most impacted.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06ad32b7d7bb3a33087df313f06ba49bd8d09f64/0_48_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b99c51e8469ed49e5d7f0ba332258279","title":"share your reaction on the belarus election result","story":"If you live, work in Belarus or are an expat, we would like to hear your thoughts on the election resultProtests have broken out in Belarus after Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled for 26 years, claimed he had won a landslide victory in an election marred by accusations of vote-rigging.In clashes that took place on Sunday, riot police used rubber bullets, flash grenades, teargas and a water cannon to quash protests.Whether you live, work in Belarus or are an expat, we would like to hear your reaction to the election result.

A once-elegant garden had been untended since the mid-1980s and was now completely overgrown.The stuff of estate agents’ dreams, the hôtel particulier – billed as “the last truly significant property in the capital’s most sought-after neighbourhood” – finally sold in January by its owners, a discreet Dutch company, at an auction that lasted barely 15 minutes. The buyer, Jean-Bernard Lafonta, paid €35.1m (£29.9m) – nearly six times the reserve price.Lafonta, a former director of the French investment firm Wendel and now head of his own industrial holding group, lost no time in February starting work on restoring the property, protected by a strict preservation order, to its former glory, residents told Le Parisien.But then workmen surveying the site stumbled across the body. “Everyone was devastated to learn it had been there so long, without any of us knowing,” said Sabine Lebreton, the vice-president of a local association dedicated to preserving the mansion.Le Monde said the corpse, the discovery of which was only recently made public, came to light as workers removed a pile of planks and rubble in one of the mansion’s cellars. Traces of wounds including broken bones and knife cuts prompted police to open a murder investigation, the newspaper said.Papers found on the body allowed authorities to identify the man as Jean-Pierre Renaud, and his death was dated to about 30 years ago. “He was someone of no fixed abode, with a drink problem,” a police source told Le Monde.“We could imagine a fight with someone else living on the margin … But it’s unclear whether he died in the mansion or was brought there, and we may never find out who was responsible. It’s quite possible the murderer is himself now dead.”Renaud’s children have been located and informed of their father’s death, police said, and Lafonta, the new owner, has declined to comment.

A month ago, Ireland had one of the lowest incidences of the disease in Europe, while the UK was still grappling with the aftermath of its disastrous start to fighting the virus.On July 2nd, a European Centre for Disease Control reported Ireland’s incidence as 2.9 cases per 100,000 of population over the preceding 14 days the UK’s was 22.7, almost eight times higher.On Monday, the tables were turned Ireland’s incidence is now 16.9, and rising rapidly the UK’s is 16.5, and steadier. Once again, as with our overall mortality figures, Ireland is back again in the middle of the pack when it comes to curbing the spread of Covid-19.A month ago, Ministers were boasting about Ireland’s low figures when implementing one of the most restrictive travel policies of any European country, a go-it-alone approach that erged from that taken by most of our EU neighbours.They won’t be boasting now, with the graph trending steeply upwards thanks to four big outbreaks in midlands meat-processing plants and clusters occurring in most of the 26 counties. Co Kildare, with a 14-day incidence of 138 cases per 100,000 population, currently has worse figures than any single country in Europe (though Spain and Romania may have regions with higher figures).Role of travelWere we smug back then? Probably. Were we complacent? That’s probably not the case, though the change in government did not help.Ironically, given the amount of time spent debating “green lists” and airport checks, travel has had little to do with the current spike in cases. Though our figures were low in late June, the virus was evidently still circulating, but was not being picked up by our testing and tracing system.We had already suffered hundreds of cases in meat-processing plants in the spring, but it seemed the problem had been dealt with, and no further clusters were being reported in this sector by June.Some of the companies seem genuinely perplexed by the speed with which outbreaks have occurred in their plants. O’Brien Fine Foods, for example, went from one case at their plant in Timahoe on July 30th to 80 cases in the space of a week.The fact that two of the companies currently experiencing outbreaks felt the need to bring in private companies, at their own expense, to test workers appears to indicate a level of dissatisfaction with the Health Service Executive’s ability to turn around tests quickly enough. Sources say it was done “to save a few hours”, but hours are crucial in identifying cases and ensuring their contacts go into quarantine.Outbreak studiesSome of the companies may just have been unlucky to have experienced a clear “super-spreader” event. In Germany, the giant slaughtering plant run by Toennies suffered 1,500 cases despite the company introducing a series of preventive measures, including building its own testing centre.That outbreak has been studied comprehensively by scientists using genetic sequencing techniques. The index case, who was masked, spread the disease to co-workers in a radius of more than eight metres over three days of work shifts, they found.Transmission was aided by the confined area of the plant, where air was constantly recirculated and cooled to 10 degrees. Shared apartments, bedrooms or carpools did not play a major role in the initial outbreak.The German research points to the need for regular and widespread testing, which appears to be happening now, finally. It also points to the outsized role played by certain “petri-dish” environments in driving initial transmission, which then spreads out into the community.More generally, current events show the need for us to be actively tracking down the virus rather than finding ourselves on the back foot again and being chased by it.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4326970.1597093745!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland among countries urged to consider reinstating covid 19 restrictions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGarda checkpoint between the Meath and Kildare border near the N4 motorway at Kilcock, Co Kildare, on Monday. A spike in coronavirus cases has forced the reintroduction of local restrictions in Kildare, Laois and Offaly. Photograph: Collins PhotosIreland and other European countries experiencing a resurgence in Covid-19 cases should consider reinstating selected restrictions to avoid further increases in cases and deaths, according to a new risk assessment by the European Centre for Disease Control.The ECDC says there is a “true resurgence” in cases in several countries as a result of physical distancing measures being relaxed.The assessment comes as the Government plans to roll out a national testing scheme in food processing plants with more than 50 employees.Officials from the Department of Agriculture met the HSE on Monday to discuss the new testing regime for workers in the food companies.A senior source said the plans will involve weekly testing in all plants in Kildare, Laois and Offaly for an initial period of four weeks.Alongside this, testing will be directed at companies with more than 50 employees nationally although risk assessments will be carried out on smaller companies and testing may follow there too.Officials are examining the national testing capacity and turnaround times but a source said the Government hopes to have the new serial testing scheme up and running by next week. Overall planA spokesman for the HSE said an overall plan would be sent to the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) later this week, after engagement with key stakeholders. The ECDC risk assessment says further incidences of Covid-19 “can be mitigated if sufficient control measures are reinstalled or reinforced in a timely manner”.Alongside a tailored and comprehensive testing strategy, the speed of contact tracing is important to reduce transmission, it says. Efforts should be made to shorten the time needed for each step in the testing, notification and contact-tracing process.Despite the rise in cases, it says countries should be better prepared to control any resurgence given the public health measures in place.Speaking at a NPHET briefing on Monday, acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said Ireland is still “in a good place” relative to many places in the world, despite recent increase in case numbers. New figures from the ECDC show the incidence of the virus in Ireland rising above that in the UK for the first time on Monday. Dr Glynn said over the past 14 days, 879 cases have been notified, giving a 14-day incidence of 18.5 per 100,000. He said Ireland’s rate was much lower than the UK’s outside counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly, where a spike in cases has forced the reintroduction of local restrictions.Regional restrictionsWarning of “ups and downs” in the number of cases to be reported over the coming days, he said it would be next week before officials could assess whether the regional restrictions were working.A further 57 cases were reported by the NPHET on Monday – lower than expected – and no deaths. The emergency team has brought forward its next meeting to Wednesday to focus on the evolving situation in the midlands.Meanwhile, Tánaiste and Minister for Business Leo Varadkar is due to meet with publicans on Tuesday, and a meeting with Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath is also planned. Sources say the Government is coming under increasing pressure from pubs to set a date for reopening and to provide extra financial support in the meantime. WaiverGovernment TDs are also calling for an enhanced economic package to support the region. Fianna Fáil TD for Kildare North James Lawless said supports “over and above the July stimulus” were needed. He has submitted a list of potential policies to his party colleague, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrath, including a waiver on licensing fees, a rebate or grant for businesses that saw stock spoiled, measures to support the hospitality sector and an extension of the local authority rates referral.

File photograph: Toby MelvilleReuters. A new £650 million Brexit support and peace and reconciliation package for Northern Ireland was announced by British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove who was visiting the North on Friday.The funding comprises £300 million of support for the European Union’s Peace Plus programme and £355 million to assist traders in the North deal with the complications of Brexit. Of the £355 million the package involves £200 million towards a new free-to-use Trader Support Service that will assist with import, safety and security declarations on behalf of traders.The other £155 million, according to Mr Gove’s office, will fund the development of new technology to ensure the new processes can be fully digital and streamlined.Mr Gove’s department said the “new service will be available to businesses bringing in goods from Great Britain or the rest of the world, providing guidance as well as dealing with their requirements for moving goods into Northern Ireland”. The £300 million confirmed by Mr Gove for the Peace Plus programme will help “to support peace, prosperity and reconciliation projects on the island of Ireland”.Mr Gove who, accompanied by Northern Secretary Brandon Lewis, was visiting Northern Ireland on Friday, said the £650 million investment underlined the British government’s “absolute commitment to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland as we move towards the end of the transition period”.“Our new free-to-use Trader Support Service will provide vital support and guidance to traders, while our £300 million investment in reconciliation projects will help to preserve the huge gains from the peace process and the Belfast Agreement,” he said. “As we continue to engage with businesses, and our discussions with the EU proceed, we will update these resources to ensure that traders are ready for the end of the transition period,” added Mr Gove.Mr Lewis said the Trader Support Service “will ensure that businesses of all sizes can have import processes dealt with on their behalf, at no cost”."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Readers queue from 2am to buy the pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestsFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceCrack in hull of Japanese-owned ship is spilling oil into country\u0026rsquos famed blue lagoonsAttitudes still shaped by legacy code of conduct that dictates women must be submissive and patientAircraft with 190 passengers and crew on board overshoots runway in heavy rain in CalicutAbe avoids reference to nuclear treaty during scaled-back ceremony due to coronavirus\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos move closer to China set to be confirmed after unusually subdued pollThree men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationNorth Korea subject to UN sanctions since 2006 over nuclear and ballistic missile programsAt least 29 killed in terror group\u0026rsquos assault on prison in eastern city of JalalabadPolice officers and government officials suspended following deaths in Punjab stateInfections surge in Latin America while China reports highest total since MarchPro-democracy opposition, which was seeking a majority, says move politically motivatedStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Government resigns amid outrage over blast that killed at least 163 people and injured 6,000Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionPort officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarersTwenty-five years after the Balkan conflict\u0026rsquos worst atrocity the Bosnian town remains idedDemonstrations stretch far beyond prime minister\u0026rsquos official residence in Jerusalem\u0026lsquoWe have no trust in our government . . .

I’d hazard that your choice says something about you. Traditionalists plump for Sean Connery, while those of an edgy or progressive bent favour Daniel Craig. One colleague argues persuasively for George Lazenby, proving that we humans are indeed a erse bunch. (Being immature, with a weakness for puns and a well-cocked eyebrow, mine is Roger Moore.) Many viewers simply choose the first they saw in a cinema.The magazine Radio Times aims to set the record straight, polling tens of thousands of readers in a knock-out tournament between the six actors who have graced the role. The results are fascinating. Connery finishes top – no surprises there. Intriguingly, Timothy Dalton’s gritty, criminally underrated Bond ends up in second place, ahead of Pierce Brosnan and Roger Moore. Daniel Craig was eliminated immediately.This seems quite the upset when you consider that not long ago, many critics were hailing Craig as the greatest ever Bond. Yet his films have never recaptured the high watermark of his debut in Casino Royale, directed by Martin Campbell, the architect of another game-changing reboot, Goldeneye. The series soon turned in a worthier and more tedious direction axing much of what was distinctively “Bond” gadgets, sexual chemistry – and yes, smutty wordplay – replacing them with bewilderingly fast-moving action sequences and CGI. Then the ultimate sacrilege Bond’s trademark Martini was supplanted in one scene by a Heineken bottle, amid so much product placement I almost wondered when they would start calling him “007UP”.There are constant efforts to unearth deeper emotional meaning from Bond exposing him as a tortured white elephant of “toxic masculinity”, rather than the elegant, seductive gentleman spy of our fantasies. This perhaps explains recent films’ obsession with Bond’s origins reflecting our own identitarian times. The end result may be more multifaceted than, say, A View to a Kill, but it eliminates much of the fun. Only the most committed fan would return for round two of Quantum of Solace.I suspect many of the Craig enthusiasts aren’t great lovers of the franchise – more likely scholarly critics, the perennially woke, or else they like him precisely because he is more Bourne than Bond. For my money, Craig is to Bond what the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are to the Royal Family both tend to alienate traditional fans while energising new audiences.Over the weekend, Dad and I watched Moonraker, one of the sillier Moore outings. We groaned as Bond tries to remain incognito among the sightseers of Venice by driving through St Mark’s Square on a hovercraft-gondola mounted on a giant Union Jack, while waiters spill drinks and a pigeon performs a double-take. We cheered as the Defence Minister, upon spotting the obligatory footage of Bond and his love interest in intergalactic flagrante, says, “My God, what’s Bond doing?”, to which Q responds: “I think he’s attempting re-entry, sir”. Bond is nothing without this element of prep school humour.In years to come, we may look back on Connery’s victory over Craig as a vital milestone in this mini culture war. While elitists push for an ever-more tortured Bond, normies like me will seek solace in double-taking pigeons and exploding pens.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and

since the end of June - but data suggests the rise is being driven by more infections in younger people and increased testing. A total of 1,062 people tested positive for Covid in the 24 hours before 9am on Sunday - nearly a fortnight after Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned of the possibility of a \u0027second wave\u0027 of infections.But the rise appearing in the UK\u0027s daily case numbers may in part be due to more testing - as infection rates climb among younger people while community testing is ramped up . According to the latest surveillance data from Public Health England, the infection rate is rising among all age groups under 65, and falling in every age group above 65 - those most at risk.Among the 15 to 44 age bracket, the infection rate has risen by 35 per cent over the last five weeks.It now almost matches the rate of infection among the over 85s, who have been the most disproportionately affected and at risk group throughout the pandemic.It suggests the recent rise in cases is being driven by cases in younger people who may not have previously been picked up by the testing regime.In the week to August 2, the rate of infection among 15 to 44 year olds in England was 11.9 per 100,00 people - up 35 per cent from the week ending July 5 at 8.8 per 100,000.It has climbed back to roughly the same rate seen in mid-June, while the infection rate among the over 85s has dropped dramatically before levelling off.At the height of the pandemic, in the week to May 3, the infection rate was at 302 per 100,000 people among the over 85s, and 44.1 in the 15 to 44 age bracket.When accounting for tests, the proportion of new cases being detected under Pillar 1 of the testing regime - for those in clinical need and public health workers - have been falling for weeks.The average number of new cases per 1,000 tests in Pillar 1 has dropped from 12.6 in early June to 1.4 by August 6.In the same period the number of tests conducted under Pillar 1 has risen from 248,338 in the week to June 7 to 357,242 in the week to August 6 - indicating a significant drop in cases.Within Pillar 2 - tests conducted by commercial partners in drive-in centres and community testing - there has been a recent uptick in the rate of cases picked up.In the last two weeks the number of cases picked up per 1,000 tests in Pillar 2 has risen from 8.2 to 9.4.Over the last fortnight the number of weekly Pillar 2 tests has risen from 545,662 to 615,648, suggesting a corresponding rise in cases in the community.But the overall trend in Pillar 2 cases has been relatively static since early July, when accounting for tests conducted.Significantly more tests are now taking place across the UK, with over one million (1,091,904) conducted in the last week alone.That represents 14 per cent more than the average weekly number in July and over eight times more than the equivalent figure for April.The rise in new cases is not evenly spread across the country, and in many areas there has not been a corresponding rise in the positivity rate of tests conducted among those in clinical need.While the infection rate in London has doubled since mid June, from 3 cases per 100,000 people to 6, it has been accompanied by a 50 per cent reduction in positive Pillar 1 tests, while the proportion of Pillar 2 tests coming back positive has risen from 0.8 per cent to 1.2 per cent.In the North West, which has seen the infection rate climb from 9.6 to 17.4 in the space of a month, the positivity rate has risen from 0.8 to 1 per cent in Pillar 1, and 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in Pillar 2.Meanwhile, those who are hospitalised with Covid now have much better chances of survival.Deaths in intensive care units are at their lowest level since the pandemic began, according to data from the Intensive Care National Audit \u0026amp Research Centre, with just two deaths in the final week of July.Though there is a significant lag between spikes in new cases translating into increased deaths, data shows that the ratio of those dying from Covid-19 in ICUs compared to those being discharged has fallen, which could indicate hospitals are grappling with the most severe cases more effectively. During April approximately two patients were dying for every three discharged, while now one patient is dying for every three discharged.However, the data for more recent weeks represents just a fraction of the numbers of patients ICU\u0027s during the pandemic\u0027s peak - in the first week of April, 1,037 patients died from Covid-19 in critical care while 1,354 were discharged.By contrast, in the first week of July, 19 died while 31 were discharged.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your

marriages mandatory","story":"The Government must overcome the fear of being labelled Islamophobic and make the registration of sharia Muslim marriages mandatory, according to a new report.Around 100,000 sharia marriages take place in the UK every year, of which up to 75 per cent are thought to be unregistered.Many Muslim women are unaware that they lack legal protection and access to marital rights after they have got married in an unregistered ceremony. For women in such unregistered religious-only marriages, orce has no legal status in UK civil or family law, leaving them facing destitution without financial assets or property as well as being shunned by their community.The report by the Civitas think tank, called Fallen Through the Cracks, cites a number of case studies featuring Muslim women in marital captivity and forced to hand over custody of their children in return for a orce.Author Emma Webb accuses successive governments of failing to address this well-known problem, claiming reluctance to act may be the result of a fear of being accused of Islamophobia.Despite calls from Muslim women activists and the international bodies, everyday women continue to suffer horribly because of completely unjustifiable shortcomings in our legislation, she said. Despite bigamy being illegal in the UK, the fact that religious-only marriages can go under the radar effectively allows men to enter into polygamous relationships that leave the women with absolutely no marital rights or legal protection under UK law. This leaves women and their children vulnerable to abuse, exploitation and destitution – it simply cannot be allowed to continue.The report recommends that the current legislation be amended to make the registration of all religious marriages in England and Wales mandatory, in line with the proposals of the Marriage Act 1949 (Amendment) Bill. It also calls for the Divorce (Religious Marriages) Act 2002 to be extended to cover Islamic orces, as was previously achieved for the Jewish community, and suggests an education campaign be launched to make people more aware of the consequences of unregistered religious-only marriages.Peers Baroness Cox and Lord Carlile both endorsed the report, published on Tuesday. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad

services bought during the coronavirus lockdown are yet to get their money back, a survey has found.Meanwhile, more than a third (36 per cent) of people are avoiding making big purchases due to fears their money would not be returned if they needed a refund and over a quarter (28 per cent) are more worried about securing a refund since the pandemic started.Some 11 per cent of those surveyed who have requested their money back are still waiting for a refund or a voucher or claim they have been denied access to it, the research from Visa found.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSome people wanting to get their money back said they had been deterred due to being unable to contact the company concerned, while others said they were confused about the returns process or did not have the time to pursue it.With many businesses having to temporarily shut in recent months, the typical refund wait time has also increased during the lockdown, the research suggests.Tui offers refunds on August holidays to mainland Spain and PortugalOne in eight people said it took more than a month to get their money back during the pandemic, compared with one in 14 who got a refund beforehand.Over-55s are experiencing the biggest typical wait for refunds, the research found with 5 per cent waiting over a month before the pandemic, compared to 17 per cent who have experienced this wait time since.More than two fifths (41 per cent) of people surveyed between 21 and 23 July had requested a return for items, services or events since the pandemic started.Among those who were able to access refunds, a fifth said they only received partial refunds, through cash or vouchers.The survey of 2,000 people across the UK, carried out by Opinium, also found that 49 per cent of people who experienced refund issues have not been able to use their purchase.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

incidences of unintentional administrative errors’ITV is embroiled in an integrity row after the broadcaster admitted that postal competition entries have been accidentally omitted from prize draws.Ofcom has instigated an investigation into the matter after an internal audit prompted ITV to report itself to the broadcast watchdog. On at least six occasions, the audit found that viewers who submitted contest entries by postal vote were unable to win.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesITV viewers are charged £2 to enter competitions advertised on programmes including This Morning, The X Factor and Loose Women if they submit their entry via text message, phone or online. Postal entries, however, are free.According to ITV, six competitions were identified between 2014 and 2019 in which postal votes were excluded, which represented a “very small proportion” of the total entries.Whatever happened to the one-hit wonder?Andi Peters applauds ITV for ‘getting more black faces’ on TVNew series of I’m a Celebrity to be filmed in the UKThe omissions are allegedly the result of “isolated incidences of unintentional administrative errors”. The broadcaster has not named the competitions involved. In a statement provided to The Times, a spokesperson said: “The integrity of all viewer competitions run by ITV is a priority for us, therefore any related error is taken seriously.“The six competitions amount to roughly one third of one per cent of our competitions since 2014, and a tiny fraction of total entries.”Ofcom has the option to impose fines of up to £250,000 or five per cent of annual revenue (whichever is greater), once its investigation into ITV is complete.ITV has reportedly used computer software to simulate all six compromised competitions, and has determined that none of the overlooked postal entries was denied a prize.ITV came under criticism in 2007 for making millions from premium rate phone-ins on series such as Ant \u0026amp Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway. It was revealed that participants’ entries were being ignored, despite being told their vote would influence the programme.At the time, Ofcom ordered ITV to pay £5.675m, a record sanction imposed on a broadcaster by the watchdog.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.

This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A publicity drive has now been launched in a bid to increase awareness of the help.It has also been subtly rebranded in some parts of the country, in the hope that might drive demand. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNearly half a million households have benefitted from the cash in the last two years, official figures show. But at current levels of uptake the Gigabit Broadband Voucher Scheme will run a surplus. £5bn for faster broadband to feature in Budget, Rishi Sunak saysBroadband speed: UK’s worst street 800 times slower than the bestBoosting fast broadband access could ‘narrow regional inequalities’An awareness drive has been launched, especially in some council areas where top-up money is available, making the scheme even more attractive. In some parts of the country, it is also sometimes referred to as the more catchy ‘broadband upgrade fund’ in a bid to boost applications.Worth a total of more than £90 million, the scheme is designed to help subsidise the cost of building faster broadband for homes and businesses.It is targeted at rural, hard-to-reach areas that are not likely to be connected through the commercial roll-out of gigabit networks in the near future.One quirk of the scheme is that to be viable, two or more households or premises have to band together. To try to encourage more people to take up the high-speed connections, ministers have also set up a new task force involving the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and Which?.Digital infrastructure minister Matt Warman said: “I urge people in rural communities in the digital slow lane to apply for the immediate financial help available so they can seize the benefits of better connectivity — from making work easier to catching up with family and friends.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Canadian residents are vandalising cars with US license plates in an attempt to deter American tourists from visiting the country, amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.Some Canadian citizens have targeted cars with US license plates in various different ways, including keying vehicles and harassing drivers, after the borders between the two countries closed for tourists on 31 March, according to the New York Times.They reported that in the four months since the border closed to US tourists only four drivers with American plates have been questioned about why they are entering Canada, and after noticing US cars in their country, some residents took action into their own hands.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, Canadians with US license plates on their cars have mistakenly been targeted by residents who thought they were in the country illegally, according to CBS News.Lisa Watt, a Canadian citizen who moved to Houston, Texas in 2000 for work, said a car tailgated her for several miles before the driver put their middle finger up at her, when she was in the country to help her 84-year-old mother cope during the pandemic.Ms Watt told CBS that it made her angry, and added: “I’m here to help my mother. I have every right to be here.”Trudeau says Canada handled coronavirus pandemic better than USVandalism of cars with US license plates has occurred so frequently over the last few months that John Horgan, premier of British Columbia, has suggested drivers with those plates replace them with Canadian ones.Mr Horgan asked Canadian residents to “be calm. Be nice” but added: “With respect to those who have offshore plates and are feeling harassed, I would suggest perhaps public transit.“I would suggest that they get their plates changed.

In Minsk, which saw the worst violence, water cannon, stun grenades and rounds of rubber bullets were deployed against protesters. In two instances, a police van drove into crowds. At least four people ended up in intensive care, with one man reportedly in critical condition. In other cities across the country, officers reportedly laid down arms and crossed to the side of protesters. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe unity opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who claimed victory in the face of the scarcely credible 9.9 per cent assigned to her by the official preliminary results, called on police and army officers to stop the violence. “I want to ask them to remember that they are part of the nation too,” she said. Hours before voting ended, Belarus had all but declared a state of emergency. Footage of soldiers and military equipment entering the capital was widely shared by locals.By 6pm local time (3pm GMT), most of the capital’s central squares and government buildings had been cordoned off. Transport systems were shut down. Roads in and out of the capital were also closed. The regime’s obvious nervousness extended to widespread efforts to control the internet. Major disruptions to mobile networks were reported from the morning, with connections practically grinding to a halt at around 10pm local time. Proxy servers, used widely in these parts to get around censorship, became unreliable.Belarus’s upcoming election spells out two very different futuresUnidentified forces want ‘massacre’ in Belarus, says LukashenkoBelarus charges opposition politicians with assisting Russian plotJournalists and other independent observers appeared to be a target. At around 2pm local time, three reporters from the Russian liberal outlet TV Dozhd were handcuffed, held to the ground, and arrested. Just before midnight, AP photographer Mstyslav Chernov was admitted to hospital with suspected concussion after being beaten by riot police while in their custody. Sunday’s events came at the end of an unexpectedly panicked campaign for Belarus’s longtime leader – one that saw opposition candidates jailed, protesters snatched from the streets, the president claim a scarcely believable Russian-backed plot, and where the opposition candidate was forced into hiding on the eve of voting.Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, 37, was never supposed to mount a serious challenge, only entering the race after President Lukashenko jailed her husband, and presidential hopeful, Sergei Tikhanovsky. Famously dismissive of women in politics, Mr Lukashenko seemed to believe the housewife and former translator didn’t have a chance.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBut her invigorating, earnest campaign surprised Belarus and it wrong-footed Mr Lukashenko. Few expected Ms Tikhanovskaya to reach an agreement with the campaign teams of other banned opposition candidates – but she managed to do so in just 15 minutes. Few believed she could lead a clear campaign – but she did so with simple promises to deliver fresh elections, walk back authoritarian changes to the constitution, and free political prisoners.Flanked by Veronika Tsepkalo, the wife of Valery Tsepkalo, another barred candidate, and Maria Kolesnikova, campaign manager for jailed Viktor Barbariko, Ms Tikhanovskaya’s opposition campaign took on unmistakably feminist, modern slant. It also brought over 200,000 people to the streets in support – an astonishing achievement in Belarus, a police state of just 9 million people, and where dissent often leads to jail.Underestimating Ms Tikhanovskaya was not the only mistake the usually clever and adroit Mr Lukashenko made in the run-up to the elections. His electoral rating was hit hard by a perceived cavalier approach to the Covid-19 epidemic: he claimed the virus was avoidable with vodka, trips to the sauna and work in the potato fields. His management of the country’s increasingly desperate economic position – and its rapidly unwinding model of Soviet planning with Russian subsidies – also provoked much anger. The extraordinary campaign to unseat Belarusian ‘dictator’ LukashenkoGiven the fact independent polling is illegal in Belarus, it was never entirely clear quite how vulnerable “Europe’s last dictator” actually became to Ms Tikhanovskaya’s challenge. But results from a handful of more reliable Minsk polling stations appeared to support the opposition claim that Ms Tikhanovskaya had, in fact, won — and convincingly.Unprecedented numbers of voters appeared to answer Ms Tikhanovskaya’s call to turn out late on Sunday — and the logic this would make falsifications more difficult. But Lidia Yermoshina, a key Lukashenko ally and chief vote counter as the head of Belarus\u0027s election committee, described the huge queues as “provocations” by the opposition. In an earlier interview on state TV, she described the opposition as a “totalitarian sect”.Independent exit polls conducted outside polling stations in foreign embassies also painted a starkly contrasting picture to the official figures. According to these surveys, Mr Lukashenko received just 6.25 per cent, compared to Ms Tikhanovskaya with 79.69 per cent. Ahead of the end of voting, Mr Lukashenko dismissed his rivals as being “unworthy of repression”. But he also seemed to make ominous warnings for those intending to protest. “All our structures and special services are ready and waiting,” he said. “There is no reason for our country to be plunged into chaos or civil war. I guarantee you that.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

May God protect Lebanon, he said repeating the last phrase three times. Local media later reported that he arrived at the presidential palace to formally submit his resignation to President Michel Aoun.Under Lebanese law, Mr Aoun will call for mandatory consultations with parliament to name a new prime minister, in the interim the current government will be resigned to caretaker status until a new one is formed. World leaders pledge €250m to help Lebanon after Beirut explosionMy dear Beirut, I am far away but I am feeling your painFireworks stored alongside stockpile in ‘dangerous’ Beirut port hangerHow Beirut firefighters were left to tackle port blasts blindLebanon’s beleaguered government had faced mounting pressure from angry citizens to step down after it emerged the explosion was caused by a fire igniting a 2,750-tonne poorly-stored stockpile of explosive ammonium nitrate that the authorities knew about.The fury has only mounted as the government has been accused of doing little to help the 300,000 people who were made homeless or whose businesses and livelihoods were destroyed.Although there were mounting calls for resignation, Mr Diab seemed unwilling to leave office and only two days ago made a televised speech in which he offered to stay on for two months to allow for various factions to agree on a roadmap for reforms. But the pressure from within his own Cabinet proved to be too much over the last 24-hours three ministers had already resigned. Beirut’s streets have been rocked by protests over the last two days, as demonstrators and members of the security forces have clashed outside parliament as well as several ministries citizens tried to occupy.The explosion, centred at Beirut port, is believed to be one of the single largest non-nuclear blasts in modern history.\u0026nbspLosses from the blast are estimated to be between $10bn to $15bn.Additional reporting from agencies\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is thanks to our sources that we have been able to share the definitive story of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.A source told The Sun Online: The book will explore the journey that Meghan and Harry went through in coming to the conclusion that they did. It will make clear that far from it being a snap decision that they took a long time to make it.The seeds of Megxit were sown before they even got married. The truth is that Harry had been deeply unhappy for a long time.And he and Meghan openly discussed going in a dferent direction well before they got married.”The Sussexes themselves are reported to have co-operated with the book that appears to have ruffled yet more royal feathers.Royal aides are worrying that the book will blame Prince William for the Megxit fiasco in January.Aides are privately braced for Wills to be “painted as the bad guy”.An insider described how they fear that the future king,  tomorrow, could be portrayed as “unsympathetic, unfeeling and unsupportive” towards the Sussexes when they decided to split from the Royal Family.Dirty laundry aired this way could be as damaging as Princess Diana’s “there were three of us in this marriage” reference to Camilla in a bombshell  TV interview, the insider claimed.A source said aides have been discussing among themselves that the book will unfairly show only Harry and Meghan’s side of the rt, even though it is not an official ­biography.Kensington Palace said it would not comment on the book.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These risks are reduced when outdoors, where surfaces may be subject to UV light and or rain.”Soft play areas could implement measures such as hand sanitiser stations, a one-way system around the soft play area, and protective screens at reception.The areas could also be deep cleaned with the use of electrostatic spray systems to prevent the virus lingering on surfaces.Visitor numbers may be limited to allow people to remain at a one metre distance from each other.On June , Boris Johnson advised people to remain at least one metre apart with social distancing rule reduced from its original spec of remaining two metres apart.But when it comes to enclosed soft play areas, social distancing will be more dficult to measure in spaces such as balls pits and climbing areas.The frequent cleaning of these spaces could also be dficult.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After new UK government guidelines came into play, advising Brits against travel to Spain after originally giving holidaymakers the greenlight, many of the worlds super-rich are looking for alternative lockdown options as the risk of a second wave becomes more imminent. This means that the worlds most wealthy would be able to enter their country of choice once citizenship is obtained and would most likely only need to follow quarantine rules on arrival. These so-called citizen-by-investment programs, or CIPs, are currently a growing industry, as are residence-by-investment arrangements, also known as golden visas.But the buying citizenship comes with a hefty price tag as well as certain requirements that wealthy clients must meet, ying from country to country. For example, you can acquire the right to live, work and study in New Zealand for roughly £.million or approximately £.million depending on the visa package you apply for. The country has been praised for its swt handling of the virus with just  deaths and only , cases after introducing strict border controls and placing residents in full lockdown, only leaving home for food and medical appointments. Just over £million and a property purchase would get you a married couple citizenship in Malta.

Trayor Lesnock, the founder of Platinum Luxury Auctions, which is conducting the online sale of Mai Island, in Fiji, told the Times that the pandemic had led people to reassess their lives and pursue the things they had fantasised about but always held off from doing.Pumpkin Island, an eco-retreat in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef Marine Park that was put on the market with a price tag of nearly £million, was described by its current owners as a “safe haven” from the pandemic.Laureth Rumble, whose family owns Pumpkin Island said: We’ve weathered the [coronavirus] storm well and people are looking for places where they will have space and where they don’t feel like they’re on top of someone  . . . I definitely think that’s an attraction.New inquiries jumped  percent in the first four months of this year, compared with the same period in , according to the company.

We see a lot of entrepreneurs and millionaires making six-figure investments.They are very wealthy people acquiring citizenships but the visa rules still apply. Many are looking for options in Europe but we have seen a signicant rise in places such as Thailand, New Zeland and Australian residency and right to live. Also places such as Portugal, Greece, Malta and the Schengen zone.Since the beginning of the pandemic, our clients are beginning to think more about their assets and balancing their portfolio.If all their assets are in one place they think do I want to change my le, its not just about a second wave. They may not be thinking about the next big pandemic in years to come, what is on the horizon. COVID has had a similar effect on our clients as the  financial crisis, similar effects on their portfolio, but this has a physical effect and matters more.Countries will allow those with citizenship to fly out but due to the pandemic, those quarantine rules will certainly still apply.No one has specically asked for COVID specied properties but with the money that is often being spent, properties will be setup with everything requires such a private location.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Weve been clear and the Department for Education have been clear that that poses a challenge to actually the ability to teach and the ability to learn in certain contexts.#We dont think that thats necessary at this point, not least because we are essentially setting up dferent class groups or year groups as social bubbles##Economist have been expecting a sharp rise in unemployment after lockdown # with a Reuters poll finding that many of them predicted the unemployment rate would rise to .% rather than the .% it currently stands at.Last week the Bank of England forecast the jobless rate would hit .% at the end of this year.#Government needs to step in and help those who are likely to lose their job retrain for new openings in dferent sectors,# KPMG economist Yael Selfin said.Weve also got some reaction just in from Chancellor Rishi Sunak on those figures # which show that some , more workers lost their jobs last month.Mr Sunak said of the latest figures: #Todays labour market stats make it clear that our unprecedented support measures, including the furlough and self-employed support schemes, are working to safeguard millions of jobs and livelihoods that could otherwise have been lost.#Ive always been clear that we cant protect every job, but through our Plan For Jobs we have a clear plan to protect, support and create jobs to ensure that nobody is left without hope.#Reacting to the ONS employment figures, health minister Edward Argar said the Government always knew coronavirus would have an #economic cost#.He continued: #We always knew that sadly this disease would not only have a health cost, but would have an economic cost and I think we are seeing the consequences of part of that.#But thats one of the reasons why the Chancellor has put in place over recent months such a signicant £ billion-worth of investment in supporting people in employment to keep their jobs, and to support businesses to keep going through this.#But its also why, in a safe way, weve got the economy moving again by reopening businesses.#Asked about transmission of the virus in relation to secondary pupils, health minister Edward Argar said the Public Health England research was #still work in progress#.He told Sky: #I think we should be cautious about reading too much into that work in progress, its important work but it isnt complete yet.#On the basis of the work that has been completed and those international comparators, we are confident that children and young people are much less at risk from this disease and from passing it on than other adults more broadly in the community.#On the basis of the evidence we have thus far, we believe that the levels of transmission between young people and the infectiousness is low. In terms of schools and the approach to getting pupils back in schools. The Prime Ministers made absolutely clear this is a national priority. Every day that children are out of school is a day lost to them, so we are going to get all pupils back to school from September.#He added: #We do have the measures in place, including testing and tracing and including the sort of measures weve seen # local lockdownsthey were necessary, but at the moment schools are a low-infection, low-risk environment compared to say some of the local lockdown areas.#Mr Argar added: #We are making contact with just shy of % of those who test positive and then we are making contact with around a similar amount of their contacts. #This is better than many, many other countries, look at New Zealand, they have a slightly higher percentage success rate, theyve traced  people.#Weve traced a quarter of a million in the space of about two and half months, that is a signicant achievement# so I do think that this is a reflection of an effective system built up rapidly that is now evolving to reflect the changing needs of local lockdowns and a local-centric approach.#Health minister Edward Argar, appearing on Sky News this morning, has insisted that NHS Test and Trace remains a #successful system# amid reports that a third of telephone contract tracers would be laid off.He told the broadcaster: #I think this is actually, this is a reflection of a successful system that, as weve always said, will flex and evolve to meet our understanding of the disease and the changing needs of our communities.#But in terms of the world beating, the world comparators, we are one of the few countries in the world that actually publishes transparently, quite rightly so you and others can question us on it, our test and trace data.#Faced with this protracted slump in passenger levels, Heathrow are calling for airport testing as a means of getting Brits back on holiday safely.But the airport also believe that airport testing could give the UK a vital economic boost. #Tens of thousands of jobs are being lost because Britain remains cut off from critical markets such as the U.S., Canada and Singapore,# said Heathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye.#The government can save jobs by introducing testing to cut quarantine from higher risk countries, while keeping the public safe from a second wave of COVID.#Worrying new figures in for the aviation industry, as Heathrows passenger numbers for July show an % decrease on last year.

But also because he was only  years old and had been married to his beautul we Lissie for just a month.It was heartbreaking to see the photos of the pair overflowing with love and happiness at their wedding — while knowing his le had been needlessly ended.Our hearts went out to Lissie, who no doubt is still trying to make sense of the tragedy. So too his mother and father. For any parent, such a loss is unthinkable. Nobody should have to bury their child.It is against the natural order of things, especially when your beloved son or daughter has been murdered.That kind of pain will never go away. It becomes the defining moment of a parent’s le.Who would blame someone in that position for opting out of le ­altogether and sinking into inertia and depression  To me, that even seems the most likely response.Instead, his mum Debbie Adlam has hit the campaign trail, arguing for longer sentences for anyone who kills a policeman.PC Harper’s killers were convicted of manslaughter but cleared of ­murder.Henry Long, , who drove the getaway car, was jailed for  years. His accomplices Albert ­Bowers and Jessie Cole, both , were each given  years.Unduly lenient sentences, to my mind — and probably yours too.On Wednesday, Lissie began a campaign to bring in “Andrew’s Law”, in memory of her late husband. She wants anyone who kills a police officer, firefighter, nurse, doctor or paramedic to be jailed for le — meaning a minimum of  years.Mrs Adlam, who has been robbed of growing old happily with her beloved son in her le, has joined the campaign.“We got to the end of our trial and we didn’t feel like justice had been done,” she said. “We felt like we had been punched.“We didn’t walk away feeling that we had done Andrew proud.”That is the nub of the matter. She wants to do right by her late son. And I imagine she will not rest until she feels she has done that.It is only when tragedy strikes that many people realise how strong and determined they can be.Nothing can bring back PC Harper. ButAndrew’s Law comes to pass, acting as a deterrent to other criminals, at least one positive will have come from an otherwise senseless death.The need for justice is a stronger force than most of us can comprehend. I think of Stephen Lawrence’s mother Doreen, whose le changed overnight when her son was ­murdered in a racist attack in .She campaigned tirelessly for reforms to the police service and founded the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust.She forged positive change from the tragic murder of her son, ­showing the strength of her feeling and the scale of her loss.I think also of Michael and Sara Payne who also campaigned with great determination after the murder of their eight-year-old daughter Sarah.As a result, parents and ­carers can now formally ask the police for information about a person who has contact with a childthey fear that person poses a threat.Then there is the Jodie Chesney Foundation, set up by Peter Chesney to tackle kne crime after his daughter was murdered last year.When faced with unimaginable loss, some people respond by taking action to change things.They are gripped with the strength to move mountains — and get the law changed.We salute their courage and their determination to find light amid the terrible darkness of their loss.How sad it is seeing footage of Keeley Bunker dancing with her trusted friend Wesley Streete, who walked her home that evening . . . then went on to murder her.Keeley was a beautul young woman, just  when she died and with her whole le ahead of her.But her “friend” chose to end that le.It is tragic seeing any le wasted – and for what  Streete’s own gratication.Let us hope he is haunted by his actions and choices for the rest of his le.Wonderful news this week as the parents of poor Charlie Gard – who died of a rare genetic condition three years ago – gave birth to a healthy baby boy.As Connie Yates said: “The world feels a whole lot more beautul this morning”.I am so happy for them after the tragedy of losing Charlie, and what a beautul baby.Congratulations.WARNINGS this week that menopausal women could be unfairly denied entry to pubs and restaurantstheir hot flushes are confused in temperature checks for Covid symptoms.Take note: No one in their right mind should keep a menopausal woman from her chilled white wine . . .It feels a bit like a sword of Damocles is hanging over the nation at the moment, with yet more job cuts announced this week – at LGH Hotels, Pizza Express and Wetherspoons.Thousands more workers are living in fear of redundancy. It is a scary prospect. But don’t panic.The best defence is preparation. Find ways to be positive. That means not taking it personally.The ROLE is redundant, not you. So don’t view redundancy as a reflection of your ability or your worth.Know your rights and get the best settlement you can. A proper redundancy process comes with a consultation period, which will give you time to weigh up your options.My advice is to engage in that process. Ask for written clarication of any offer andyou are unhappy in any way, there are plenty of employment lawyers you can talk to. Or free help is available from Acas.Sort out your finances. Work out how much money you need for day-to-day living and,you can, keep some back for emergencies. Cut out spending on non-essentials and work out how to manage everything from mortgage payments to credit card debt.You might have to tighten your belt for a bit but that’s not the end of the word. For many people, redundancy is a chance to consider what they might do dferently.That is easier said than done but try to see it as an opportunity – to go freelance, start a business, become a consultant, get another job or re-enter education – rather than an ending.I love a romantic gesture as much as anyone.But the -year-old man who spelled out “Marry Me” using  tea lights made me wonderhe might have found another way.The candles set fire to the living room and seriously damaged the flat he shared with his girlfriend.But she still said yes!And at least she knows what she is getting herself into.It is always hard seeing photos of people enjoying a holiday in the sun when you are working.And this year, more than ever, I’ve been consumed with envy of the lucky souls who somehow got away despite all the travel restrictions.Having seen multiple beachtastic photos of Coleen and Wayne Rooney, who jetted off to the Caribbean what seems like weeks ago, is it wrong of me to admit I’ll be quite pleased when the holiday season is over We need a word for the irritated envy of others’ amazing holidays.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Labour councillors and MPs shake their heads about the dangers of opening while never reflecting on the risk of keeping schools closed.Even Labour’s new leader Sir Keir Starmer is worried about safety . . .  and his own children attended school during lockdown.The risks to children from Covid- are next to non-existent. Teachers are more likely to be hit by a bus than contract coronavirus from kids.Butthe risks of the schools opening in September are minimal, the cost of schools staying shut is beyond measure.Already, a generation of kids have seen their education become another victim of coronavirus.Some , of them could not sit their GCSEs in spring. And , could not sit their A levels.The years below them, due to sit those le-changing exams next spring, have lost six months of their education they will never recover.A report by the National Foundation for Educational Research said  per cent of state-school children had between none and one online lesson a day during the long months of lockdown.The most disadvantaged children have suffered the most.The schools are due to open in just  days and the vast majority of parents — almost  per cent — want them to start as planned.But even as Gavin Williamson was making his bold promise to throw open the school gates, Business ­Secretary Alok Sharma was mewing that school closures would be ­considered on a “case by case” basis, while Schools minister Nick Gibb bleats he can’t “decree” that every pupil will be back at their desk in September. These timid Tories must start showing some spine.With the schools closed, parents cannotto work. Already unemployment is soaring. Already there are hard times ahead.If parents and their children stay at home during the autumn months, this country will be on its knees for years.The A-level results will be announced this Thursday and the class of  will finally discover the damage that Covid- has done to their dreams.For the first time ever, A-level grades will be estimated, and there are countless families across the country holding their breath, me included.But for the millions of children meant to be in school, the future is even more uncertain.If their schools do not open in September it will be a craven act of surrender to extremist teaching unions.And a national tragedy that ­effectively chucks an entire generation on the scrapheap.IT is  years since Cameron Diaz made her movie debut opposite Jim Carrey in The Mask and six years since her last film.Cameron says retiring from the movies has brought her the peace she has always craved.And, of course, having an estimated £million in the bank usually has a calming effect.The thieving simpletons responsible for his death will all be free before they turn .The police get endless stick these days. But PC Andrew Harper was the best of us.Andrew had been married to his childhood sweetheart Lissie for just four weeks when he was dragged to his death after becoming entangled in a tow rope dangling from the back of a car being used to steal a quad bike.Driver Henry Long, , got  years. Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole, both , got  years. Not once have they shown even a flicker of remorse. But the law allows a third of a term off sentences for murder and manslaughter.Now Andrew’s widow Lissie has launched a campaign for “Andrew’s Law”, which will mean a full le term for killing  workers.“I wish to ensure any widows of the future will not have to experience the same miscarriage of justice,” says Lissie, . “I pledge to my late husband to never stop until I have made the dference this country needs.”I know that every reader of this paper will wish Lissie well.The sentences handed down to Long, Bowers and Cole might be what we would expect for manslaughter convictions.But God knows it does not feel very much like justice.“NO one here gets out alive,” sang The Doors’ Jim Morrison.Jim could have been thinking of Public Health England, the quango of clowns charged with protecting the nation’s health and wellbeing.PHE has developed a unique way of counting our corona- virus dead. If you catch Covid-, PHE claims you as a virus victim evenyou recover and die many months later of something .Who does their maths, Diane Abbott PHE’s madcap counting system means all , cases of coronavirus in England will eventually be added to the UK’s Covid- death toll – because we all have to go some time.PHE receives £million of your money a year to produce this garbage.The explosion has left more than  dead, , hurt and , homeless.Israa Seblani, , is the bride who was posing for wedding photos at the very moment the Lebanese capital was devastated by the huge blast.A doctor herself, Israa helped the wounded before seeking safety. A reminder that, even in the midst of tragedy, there is still kindness, decency and courage.CALAIS politician Pierre-Henri Dumont says: “Maybe we should do more” to stop migrants crossing the Channel. Love that “maybe”, monsieur!Priti Patel threatens to send in the Royal Navy but that shouldn’t be necessary. It is contrary to international law that these desperate souls are not claiming asylum in the first safe country they reach.But as they continue to arrive here on a daily basis, you have to say they look happy to have reached this country from the war-torn wastelands of, er, France.Perhaps the UK is not quite the racist hellhole it is frequently cracked up to be.THE Government is mocked for launching its wildly popular Eat Out To Help Out scheme while, at the same time, Boris is posing in gyms and waging his private war on obesity. But they are both great ideas. There is a place in everyone’s le for regular exercise and regular peri-peri chicken.So it is odd that every picture of Summer Monteys-Fullam – hanging out with her horse, posing with her glamorous mum, running with her dog Cookie – is accompanied by the demeaning appendage “Bake Off judge Paul Hollywood’s ex-girlfriend.” To some of us, Summer means more than Paul.Or as we like to think of him: “Paul Hollywood, , the ex-boyfriend of Summer Monteys-Fullam.”AFTER repeatedly punching his greyhound in the face, Joseph Pocklington, , has been banned from keeping pets for two years.If a dog was guilty of such a brutal assault, it would be put down.

The friend said: Cant believe Im buying you a school shooter hat butit makes you happy.Robin is said to have replied its not a school shooter hat, its a band hat.Fulton County Prosecutor Michael Marrs said: So I mean, anytime anyone’s obsessed with Columbine, yes, it’s a fine line between free speech and when you cross the line, but I think in this case, clearly what they had done was going to interfere with the occupancy of a school.He added: Anything like this, were going to take extremely seriously because I think history has shown us that sadly, these kind of things do get carried out. And were not going to take it lightly.Marrs added more information about the case would be released in the coming weeks.Charges of  conspiracy to commit murder and intimidation were filed against the pair on July .Schultz is being held at the Fulton County Jail and Robin, still a minor, is being held in a juvenile detention center but will be transferred when he turns  later this month.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And Meghan would have been the person that guided him on that journey.Mr Scobie was speaking just two days before Finding Freedom is released on August  - a biography widely claimed to be giving the side of Harry, , and Meghan, , as they quit the Royal Family.And while they have stepped back from the Firm, the couple have continued to work with charities and speak out over equality and race issues.Prince Harry most recently revealed he and Meghan had been callingbusinesses, urging them to stop advertising on social media.Companies that purchase online ads must also recognise that our digital world has an impact on the physical world - on our collective health, on our democracies, on the ways we think and interact with each other, on how we process and trust information, he wrote in an opinion piece for Fast Company.Because,we are susceptible to the coercive forces in digital spaces, then we have to ask ourselves - what does this mean for our children  As a father, this is especially concerning to me.The couple also urged their fans to get involved in uncomfortable conversations in a recent speech from their LA home.Harry and Meghan are currently living in Calornia with baby Archie after quitting the Firm earlier this year.And Caroline Durand, who also authored the upcoming biography, spoke out of the couples decision, saying: Harry really was looking out for his family.

Hassan also added that Prime Minister Hassan Diab will head to the presidential palace to hand over the resignation in the name of all the ministers.Speaking to reporters, Hassan said: The whole government resignedPresident Michel Aoun accepted Diabs resignation and asked the government to stay on in a caretaker capacity until a new cabinet was formed.Rage had been mounting as rioting swept the streets of Beirut following the blast last week that injured , and left at least , people homeless.The horric explosion was one fth the size of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima.It emerged that numerous officials - including Lebanese president Michael Aoun - knew about the stash of , tonnes of ammonium nitrate in Beirut which caused the disaster. Warnings had been issued years before as the killer cargo was seized from a ship owned by a Russian businessman who had gone bankrupt.Several ministers had already stepped down amid murmurings that the government was on the brink of collapse.The cabinet, formed in January with the backing of the powerful Iranian-backed Hezbollah group and its allies, met today after a slew of resignations.Justice minister Marie-Claude Najms, information minister Manal Abdel-Samad,finance minister Ghazi Wazni, defence minister and deputy PM Zeina Akar, and environment minister Damianos Kattar all resigned in quick succession.Kattar blasted the system as flaccid and sterile, while Abdel-Samad said the government had let the people down.Meanwhile, Lebanese MPs Paula Yacoubian and Samy Gemayel resigned, with the latter confirming two other colleagues from his Kataeb party had also quit.Yacoubian had called for the entire Lebanese government to resign - and said it was her duty to step down over the failures that led to the explosionThe apparant collapse of the government came as prosecutor Ghassan El Khoury began to question the heads of government agencies over the explsion.Lebanese people had been calling for the entire regime to go following the disaster which came after the months of anti-government protests.Joe Haddad, an engineer, told Reuters: The entire regime needs to change. It will make no dferencethere is a new government. We need quick elections.Food shortages and unrest are mounting in the city as the disaster compounded anger stemming from a severe economic crisis and the coronavirus pandemic.Eli Abi Hanna, whose home was destroyed, said: It was easier to make money during the civil war. The politicians and the economic disaster have ruined everything.And meanwhile, Prime Minister Diab said on Saturday he would request early parliamentary elections.It wont work, its just the same people. Its a mafia, said Antoinette Baaklini, whose workplace was demolished in the explosion.University student Marilyne Kassis added: It will always be the same. It is just a political game, nothing will change.The killer cargo of , tons of ammonium nitrate was confiscated in  from the Moldovan-flagged ship Rhosus while en route from Batumi in the ex-Soviet republic of Georgia to MozambiqueThe ammonium nitrate was sold by Georgian fertiliser maker Rustavi Azot LLC, and was to be delivered to a Mozambique explosives maker, Fabrica de Explosivos.It was however impounded by Lebanese authorities, and sat on the dockside in Warehouse  for six years until it blew up last Tuesday.Reportedly the blast was sparked when a reckless welder caused a fire at nearby Warehouse  - which then spread to the explosive Warehouse .Hang up the nooses trended across Lebanese social media as grief turned to fury in the days following the explosion.Sources close to the investigation blamed the incident on inaction and negligence, saying nothing was done by committees and judges involved in removing the explosives.Public Works Minister Michel Najjar told Al Jazeera he had only found out about the presence of the explosive material stashed at the port  days before the explosion.No minister knows whats in the hangars or containers, and its not my job to know, he said.Badri Daher, Director General of Lebanese Customs, told broadcaster LBCI that customs had sent six documents to the judiciary warning that the material posed a danger.He said: We requested that it be re-exported but that did not happen. We leave it to the experts and those concerned to determine why.Another source close to a port employee said a team that inspected the ammonium nitrate six months ago warned thatit was not moved it would blow up all of Beirut.Two documents revealed that Lebanese Customs had asked the judiciary in  and  to ask the concerned maritime agency to re-export or approve the sale of the ammonium nitrate.One of the documents cited similar requests in  and  - suggesting repeated warnings about the danger were overlooked by the authorities.It is a white crystalline solid and is highly soluble in water - with the chemical formula NH₄NO₃.The chemical is applied in granule form into the soil and quickly dissolves under moisture, allowing nitrogen to be released.Another use of ammonium nitrate is in the food industry where it is used as a nutrient in producing antibiotics and yeast.In most countries, it is used to make explosives for mining, quarrying and civil construction because of its low cost and ready availability.It has been the cause of numerous industrial explosions over the last three decades, including the explosion at a chemical plant in Toulouse, France, in  that killed  people.Ammonium nitrate was also used to create the explosives used in the  Mumbai train bombings.By itself, ammonium nitrate is not regarded as dangerous but under certain conditions, it can become deadly.The chemical is classied as an “energetic material” meaning that it produces heat as it decomposes.If there is a signicant amount of ammonium nitrate it can generate enough heat to catch fire and continue to burn eventually causing an explosion. Prime Minister Diab had vowed those responsible will pay the price - but the focus of the probe and public anger has turned on the regime.International aid is being mobilised across the world to help support the victims and search for the dead among the rubble.The US, UK, France, Gulf states and even rivals Israel have offered money and assistance - but Canada has refused to give cash directly to the Lebanese government due to fears of corruption.Royal Navy vessel HMS Enterprise has arrived to carry out survey work in the port to establish the extent of the damage.British engineering experts have found the blast was unquestionably one of the largest non-nuclear explosions ever to take place.The team from the University of Sheffield has calculated the strength of the blast based on the videos and photographs of the catastrophe.They believe the explosion was the equivalent of , to , tonnes of TNT.Protests mount as , people gathered at Martyrs Square and some demonstrators stormed government ministries and the Association of Lebanese Banks over the weekend.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Max Lapre, renowned for his strict leadership of the Dutch government, ordered five elite tribesmen to be gunned down.Its claimed that the tribe wanted to seek vengeance on a white man. Rockefeller reportedly swam  miles to shore and after washing up on the beach, he was speared through the ribs.He was then smacked around the back of his head until he was dead - and the tribe began their ritual. The tribe first removed Michaels head, then slit him down from the neck to his back. His intestines were then removed. Legs and arms would go into the fire while the group chanted. His charred body parts would be passed around for everyone to taste.His blood, which they saved, would be smeared over their bodies. Once the head was fully cooked, they would scalp it, remove his brain and eat it.If theyd killed Michael that was how it wouldve been done, the author said.The Dani tribe sometimes transformed decapitated skulls into pillows or used them as bowls to eat the flesh of rival tribe members.Headhunting stopped in the s. Within the tribe, men reportedly had sex with men, they shared wives, and practised polygamy. They sometimes drank each others urine and covered themselves in human blood during bonding rituals.In their eyes, killing the American was revenge for the deaths of tribesman at the hands of the white Dutch. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yesterday, the Prime Minister hit the road to inspect the measures schools have put in place.He said: “It’s not right that kids should spend more time out of school. It’s much better for their health and mental wellbeing, and obviously their educational prospects,everybody comes back full-time in September. It’s our moral duty as a country to make sure that happens.”Thanks to social distancing and hygiene measures, St Paul’s Church of England Primary School in Swanley, Kent, fully reopened in June.Here, its head teacher blasts the unions for failing children with their “can’t do” attitude. AS a country, we are trying to get back to some sort of normality — and schools have a big part to play in that.Getting children back into the classroom is vital so parents can get back to work.Yet this is proving anything but child’s play.Unions have hit schools with a checklist of  demands before opening next month. This exhaustive list includes assurances that schools will take specic measures to stop children drinking hand sanitiser, extra support for the wellbeing of staff suffering from workload worries, anxiety or the effects of trauma and insisting classes be held “one week on, one week off”.Union members have been urged to present this checklist to headteachers and to expect its completion.It is not helpful. Unions should be working with schools to ensure there is a safe , not creating ision — which is what this will do. If we keep looking at checklists of things that need to be ticked off, we will never get schools reopened.It will never be perfect for everyone. Nothing is. There are always dfering opinions.When askedthe checklist raised the bar too high, NEU president Amanda Martin responded: “This is people’s safety. What cost is safety ”Of course safety is important. But unions should be pulling together and supporting schools, rather than making it very dficult for them to come back.Before my school reopened, I was stunned to hear some unions were encouraging teachers not to engage in conversation with head-teachers. How is that helpful to anyone We have a responsibility to children to be back. If we don’t come back now, when We can’t keep putting it off. We must come back at some point and September is as good a time as any.It is about common sense and making sure the school community is as safe as it can be. Get the basics done from the off and tweak it as we go. That is how it should work.And I know — because I made it work.When we reopened our school in June we followed the guidance the Government set out to the letter.We didn’t have any cases of staff or students falling ill with the virus.We installed a marquee in our playing field to create extra space, as well as supplying portaloos and mobile handwashing facilities to keep pupils and staff safe.Classes were kept apart with inidual entrances and exits. Yes, we are a smaller school with fewer children.But I have fewer staff and less space to play with.As a community, the school came together, did the right thing and got the children back. That’s what it is about: Working with your community — the pupils, parents and staff.Inevitably, there was going to be some sort of drop in pupils’ learning. But children are really resilient. We saw that when they came back.They were straight back into six-hour days, with a full timetable of learning.They dealt with it really well. Actually, they loved coming back to the stability and routine of what they knew.As much as you try to put in a timetable at home, you don’t follow it because the environment is very dferent.I have two children myself and know how hard it was during that time . . . and I’m a teacher.My we and I were both working full-time from home. To get my six-year-old to do more than an hour’s work was incredibly dficult.You don’t get the same experience sitting in front of a screen watching a teacher online as you do being in a classroom interacting with other people.I strongly feel schools have a responsibility to give parents the opportunity to get back into some sort of normality with work.Because we brought all our children back, parents were able to work better from home and do the things they needed to do.We had a number of parents who were made redundant during lockdown.With not having the children at home, they had the chance to look for other work. Meanwhile, their kids were safe.Just this week, Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the “very low” risk to children from Covid- meant the reopening of schools is safe.Research carried out in  institutions across the UK will confirm “there is very little evidence” of coronavirus transmission where pupils have ed.I hope this will help reassure parents, as the negative impact of keeping children away from classrooms runs deeper than their education.The effect on the mental health of our nation’s youngsters could be catastrophic. The social impact of schools is vital.We were back for a month before the summer holidays and that was one of the overriding factors parents talked about. Lots of children were sad, very quiet and not their normal selves during lockdown.But coming back to school really changed them. That was evident from day one.Parents had been concerned about their children’s mental health and could see how happy they were to be back at school, where they were able to interact with their friends and peers and reignite those friendships.It was wonderful to hear children laughing and enjoy- ing each other’s company.That is something you can’t get in lockdown — the social aspect of school le.Schools are at the heart of most communities.Andschools can get back safely, the rest of the community will hopefully follow back into some normality.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

How does that make sense  Tell that to any mother in the world.Meghan’s decision caused uproar with those who believed that as the taxpayers part-fund the monarchy, they have a right to see Archie on his christening day, according to the book.Finding Freedom claims revealed today include:The christenings of most other royal children including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s three children were attended by media and widely publicised.Instead Meghan and Harry released just two pictures of baby Archie after the christening – a family portrait and an intimate black and white picture of the three of them.The book goes on to describe how the couple made a similar decision when they decided to keep the  members of the press covering their African tour away when Archie was taken to meet Archbishop Desmond Tutu, instead taking their own pictures.Details of Meghan’s own baptism ahead of her wedding to Harry – and her strong faith – are also revealed in the book.Although she was not brought up religious, friends claim that Meghan has always had a strong belief in God, which helped her get through her “darkest moments”.Meghan used to pray with one of her best friends at Northwestern University and used to gather the cast and crew of Suits together for a “prayer circle” before starting work.She decided to get baptised into the Church of England “out of respect to the Queen”, according to the book and the ceremony was held at St James’s Palace’s Chapel Royal.While the Queen, William and Kate did not attend the ceremony, there were  guests – including Charles and Camilla – present to watch Meghan have holy water poured on her head as a choir performed.Guests then celebrated at a dinner party at Clarence House, hosted by Prince Charles.Meghan had to have several meetings with the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby ahead of the baptism, where she discussed “personal matters” including her orce to Trevor Engelson and what she had learned from that failed marriage.The book also gives a glimpse into baby Archie’s first year of le in which “hands-on” dad Harry was in charge of “changing most of Archie’s diapers” to give Meghan, who was nursing the baby, a break.Harry liked that to be “his ‘job’ especially as Meghan has so much more to do”.Little Archie also enjoyed baby swimming lessons and music classes.Meghan brought him by herself to the Happy Clappy music class in Windsor, where he played with a tambourine while royal protection officers waited outside, the book said.He also loved being read to by his parents and his favorite book was Is Your Mama a Llama by Deborah Guarino.During the couple’s Africa tour, little Archie learned to mimic the sounds of the animals outside during a stay at the high commissioner’s residence in Cape Town.Once they left the UK following “Megxit” and moved to the Mille Fleurs estate in Victoria, Canada, worried Meghan and Harry baby-proofed the mansion to protect the tot, who was described as growing “at the speed of light”.As well as covering sharp edges with “discreet rubber pads” and moving furniture out of the way they also tried to “paparazzi-proof” the property by installing extra fencing.They proudly boasted to friends how Archie – who they nicknamed Bubba – was in the th percentile for his height, according to the book authors.It has been previously reported how the book told how Prince Harry was “delightfully surprised” when he took Meghan on a camping trip and she took bathroom breaks in the woods.Meghan, , and Harry, , have insisted they had nothing to do with the book, while the authors have said they did not speak to them directly.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The First Minister admitted that ministers didnapost get this right after , pupils had their predicted results downgraded following the cancellation of exams during the coronavirus pandemic. Pupils will not all be expected to appeal against their results, Ms Sturgeon said, in an attempt to curb the growing row over the issue, which disproportionately affected the poorest pupils.

Opposition parties have called on Mr Swinney to resign over the issue - and he faces a vote of no confidence at Holyrood next week. Ms Sturgeon originally defended the process but made a u-turn on Monday in the face of growing outrage. She said: We will be taking steps to ensure that every young person gets a grade that recognises the work they have done.  Our concern - which was to make sure that the grades young people got were as valid as those they would have got in any other year - perhaps led us to think too much about the overall system and not enough about the inidual pupil. That has meant that too many have lost out on grades that they think they should have had and also that that has happened as a result of not of anything theyaposve done but because of a statistical model or an algorithm, and in addition that burden has not fallen equally across our society.

Unions have warned the Government needs an alternativecases start rising from September. Mr Johnson has said getting all children in England back to school full-time next month is the “right thing for everybody”. Even schools in swathes of the North West that have undergone further restrictions due to sharp rises in coronavirus cases will be expected to open. One union said ministers should consider a “week-on, week-off” rota system for pupilsthere are further lockdowns. But the Prime Minister said he hoped schools would not be forced to close by local leaders. He said on a school visit in East London: “Clearly what we are doing – the way we are trying to manage the pandemic – is to have local measures in place and local test and trace to introduce restrictions where that’s necessary. Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here “But, as we have all said, the last thing we want to do is to close schools. We think that education is the priority for the country and that is simple social justice.” The PM is facing calls to dramatically overhaul the national test and trace system to safely reopen schools – without imposing further restrictions on businesses or social lives. But he has been warned by his scientic advisers that “trade-offs” may be necessary to keep transmission rates down. They have claimed the nation may have reached the limit of what can be reopened safely. No confirmed yesterday that pubs and restaurants might have to shut to keep schools open in a local lockdown. Mr Johnson’s official spokesman said: “It’s correct to say schools would be the absolute last sector to close in any local lockdown. “Other venues would be expected to be closed first in the event that strict lockdown measures had to be applied.” Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said heads supported the full reopening of schools in September and the pledge to make it a national priority. But he added: “We are concerned about the lack of a national plan Bthere is a second wave of coronavirus and there is a second national shutdown. “The Government guidance requires schools to have in place their own contingency plans which are based on ato remote education in the event of local closures.” Mr Barton added: “We would like to see more thought given to blended learning as a back-up plan which could be a rota system of children in for one week and then learning at home for one week. This would be better than children ing solely to remote education. “But we need some national modelling on how this might work informed by scientic advice so there is an off-the-shelf alternative that is ready to go.” Avis Gilmore, of the National Education Union, added: “Government could do much more to assure schools and local authorities that, should a second spike occur, either nationally or locally, there is a clear Plan B in place.  “This plan needs to spell out what action must be taken in a iety of situations, so that schools and colleges can make the preparations parents expect of them.” The PM struck a more conciliatory tone to education unions after months of attacking them - praising the work that school staff had already done to make classrooms safe. He said: “It’s very important that everybody works together to ensure that our schools are safe and they are - they are Covid secure - I have been very impressed by the work that the teachers have done, working with the unions, to make sure that all schools are safe to go back to in September. “But, basically, the plan is there - get everybody back in September, that’s the right thing for everybody in this country.” Leading expert Professor Russell Viner said the week on-week off proposal appeared to make “very little dference” to the overall risk to both pupils and teachers. The president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said that children are “very minor players” in the transmission of coronavirus and opening schools would “add little” to the reproduction rate of infection. Prof Viner, also a member of the Government’s Sage scientic advisory group, said that reopening schools is “one of the least risky things we can do”.  Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has said that a study, expected to be published in the next week, would show there was little evidence of transmission in schools. Schools in Scotland go back today [TUES] while Welsh first minister Mark Drakeford has said that in Wales, some schools could be forced to close in the event of a local outbreak. “Every local flare-up is dferent in some places not reopening schools would be part of a plan, in other sorts of outbreaks that may not be necessary. It’s down to the local circumstances, down to the team on the ground. and they will then advise Welsh ministers,” he said. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said that ‘test and trace’ had to be better to give parents the confidence to send their children back to school.

The Prime Minister said it was bad and stupid and dangerous and criminal for desperate people to travel to the UK in small boats. Campaigners accused Mr Johnson of using inflammatory soundbites as tensions escalated over the influx of asylum seekers arriving in the UK. More than , people are believed to have come to Britain so far this year, making the treacherous journey across the worldaposs busiest shipping lane. The Government has been accused of being increasingly chaotic in its handling of the situation - with anger over Home Secretary Priti Patelaposs request to bring in the Navy to deal with the number of small boats. But Mr Johnson ramped up his rhetoric on the issue, saying the Government would look at the law to make it easier to send migrants home again. Speaking on a visit to a school in Essex on Monday, he said: Be in no doubt whataposs going on is the activity of cruel and criminal gangs who are risking the lives of these people taking them across the Channel, a pretty dangerous stretch of water in potentially unseaworthy vessels. We want to stop that, working with the French, make sure that they understand that this isnapost a good idea, this is a very bad and stupid and dangerous and criminal thing to do. But then thereaposs a second thing weaposve got to do and that is to look at the legal framework that we have that means that when people do get here, it is very, very dficult to then send them away again even though blatantly theyaposve come here illegally.No said Brexit would make it easier to create new rules for dealing with migrants, claiming the UK was bound by inflexible and rigid EU regulations, which decide which country is responsible for considering asylum claims. Refugee campaigners condemned the Governmentaposs rhetoric on asylum seekers and called on the Prime Minister to avoid scapegoating desperate people. Lisa Doyle, director of advocacy for the Refugee Council, said: Itaposs incredibly disappointing to hear the Prime Minister using such inaccurate and inflammatory language to describe men, women and children who are desperate enough to make perilous journeys across the busiest shipping channel in the world. Seeking asylum is not a crime, and it is legitimate that people have to cross borders to do so. She urged ministers to avoid scapegoating people in desperate circumstances and instead to provide better legal routes to claiming asylum.

As temperatures soared to C in some parts, the Coastguard saw a surge in the number of rescue operations it attended. On Saturday alone, the responded to a staggering  incidents with a total of  people being rescued from waters across the country. The figures beat the previous record on Friday, August  when the Coastguard dealt with  incidents in one day. There were also a number of fatalities as people took to the coast, with one woman in her s pulled leless from the water after being caught out by the strong current at Waxham, Norfolk. Members of the public tried in vain to resuscitate her before paramedics took over, but she was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. The tragedy happened at about .pm on Sunday when the beach was still packed with sunseekers. The beach and nearby Sea Palling are notorious for having dangerous riptides that can sweep away unsuspecting swimmers. Another woman died following a collision between a water bike and a boat off the coast of Anglesey. She was taken to hospital but pronounced dead shortly after the incident near the Menai Bridge.In Scotland, emergency services were called to reports of three young people in dficulty at roughly .pm - with two of the children, a boy and girl, managing to free themselves. Sadly the third child, Ava Gray, was found leless at .pm, reports the Daily Record. Separately, a child was air-lted to hospital after being swept out to see on an inflatable at Morfa Bychan beach in Caernarfon. HM Coastguardaposs head of coastguard operations, Richard Hackwell, said there had been a big rise in incidents this weekend as more people visit coastal areas and head to the beach. Two men also lost their lives in separate incidents at Clacton beach in Essex and  Bawsey Pits country park in Norfolk.  We understand that people want to have fun at the coast and enjoy the heatwave but we urge everyone to respect the sea and take responsibility in helping to ensure the safety of themselves, friends and family, he said. The RNLI issued several warnings to beach-goers about the use of inflatables in the sea. Yesterday, there were five separate call-outs along Bournemouth beach in Dorset yesterday involving children as young as seven years old who got caught out by a strong off-shore wind. In the most serious incident, a teenage girl and her father were rescued  yards off Bournemouth pier in fading light. They had fallen off their inflatable and spent  minutes treading water before being plucked out of the sea by a leboat crew.  A police helicopter which was also involved in the rescue dropped floating devices for them to hold on to before Poole Leboat arrived. Both the father and daughter were suffering from hypothermia and were in a aposdistressedapos state. They were wrapped in blankets and met by an ambulance crew on ing to shore which took them to hospital. Their present condition is unknown. Volunteer Helm Dave Riley, of Poole Leboat, said they were aposextremely luckyapos to survive such a long time in the water. He said an extra  minutes could have meant aposa dferent outcomeapos.  He said: The two people we saved tonight were extremely lucky. Although the weather has been hot, the sea temperatures are still cold enough to cause hypothermia when submersed for  minutes as they both were. Given another  minutes, it could have been a very dferent outcome. Today has seen Poole Leboat volunteers launch to an unprecedented number of inflatables and blow up dinghies, our advice is to leave them at home and do not use them on the beaches.

Leicester was the first city to have some of its newly-found freedoms reversed when the coronavirus infection rate there became too high. In the subsequent weeks towns and cities across the UK have been locked down to dferent degrees and to much less fanfare. This has left many Brits unsure exactly what it is they should and shouldnapost be doing.To clear up the confusion Lockdown Checker has launched an easy to use website which allows users to type in their postcode and find out the local rules.For example, a person typing in a postcode for Na h-Eileanan Siar in Scotland - which has the lowest case rate at . per , - will conjure up very dferent results from a Leicester local - where the rate currently stands at almost . per , people. In Na h-Eileanan Siar in the Outer Hebrides only national lockdown rules apply. That means locals can visit non-essential shops and meet another household indoors. They may also dine in restaurants and banish the brisk Scottish air with a dram in the pub. Those in Leicester are not so lucky. Lockdown Checker records that the city is an aposarea of interventionapos, meaning the government is treating it as a special case.  While those in Leicester may visit non-essential shops, they are not permitted to meet indoors with another household. In the coming weeks the developers of the site hope to add the number of coronavirus cases per , population to the widget. It was reported earlier today that Oldham recorded  new cases of Covid- in the last seven days to August , official government figures show. This means that there are  new cases per , people in the local area - the highest current rate in England, and above previous hotspots Leicester and Blackburn with Darwen.

Their lives, quite literally, depend on it. Here in the UK, black and mixed-race parents have been having a very dferent but equally necessary chat for years – on how their skin colour will affect their lives. No white parent will ever have to go through such a rite of passage with their kids – which probably explains the failure in certain quarters to appreciate the frustration at the Labour MP Dawn Butler being stopped by police over the weekend. Or the indference at the BBC over the ’N’ word row. Channel ’s excellent show, also called The Talk, brought the brutal truth into our living rooms last week. Little Mix singer Leigh-Anne Pinnock spoke of being told “your race will hold you back a bit”. Unfair This Morning presenter Rochelle Humes wept as she recalled the racist abuse she’d suffered when having the talk with her daughter. “My legs were red,” she said. “Because I tried to rub my skin off.” Sky News presenter Gillian Joseph said: “You do have to rob your children of their innocence at quite an early age.”As parents we are indeed having to move quickly to manage our kids’ expectations of a brutal, unfair world and the unconscious bias that comeswith being black or mixed-race.We have no choice but to prime them with history. And arm them with examples of the fact that we exist in a society within which you are more likely to be vilied for reporting, calling out or standing up to discrimination than the actual perpetrator. The social media abuse aimed at Ms Butler for revealing she’d been stopped by police for no discernible reason other than being in ‘a nice car’, is one such example. “Don’t get me started on ‘you match the description’,” said Britain’s Got Talent winner Ashley Banjo on The Talk. If you are black or mixed race, you just know. It’s a fair bet thatMs Butler had not identied herself she’d have been handcuffed and patronised before her feet could touch the ground – just as the Olympic athletes Ricardo dos Santos and Bianca Williams were last month. Many of Ms Butler’s white critics claim to have no problem being stopped by police. The dference is, few of them share the mistrust of the police which black people have – based on an apprehension they could be at best humiliated in public, and at worst mistreated.

Kim Farry, , went to prison for theft and subsequently was branded the country’s ‘shoplting queen’. Since coronavirus lockdown though, the gran-of- has been “changing lives” by leading virtual fitness classes, helping people lose weight and fight addiction. She has previously been turned down for work as an escort because of her criminal record. She hopes the work will “finally give her a break in le” as she’s become “heartbroken” at desperately trying to change her image. And though Kim, a former cleaner, admitted she loved the money she made as a career criminal, she’s vowed she’ll neverto her law-breaking ways. Speaking from her council house in Fulham, southwest London, Kim today told : “I look back and the money every day was good but I definitely won’t be doing all that again. I did it to support my family. It became my job I classed it as my business. “Now I don’t want to sponge of benefits too. I don’t want to live in the council flat. So now I’m changing lives and I’m determined to finally get my break in le. People tell me they are inspired by my journey so I enjoy helping others.  “I lead the fitness classes, I help people change their diets, lose weight and change a few things about their attitude sometime. “I use YouTube and Facebook videos and have  people who watch my videos regularly. I have had people talk to me in tears as they’re so pleased. I think that is so nice. These are strangers.” Kim started the venture after she couldn’t afford huge prices for gym membership before they closed for lockdown. And, after admiring the work of Joe Wicks online, Kim thought she’d have a go.  The mum added: “Gyms are expensive. I do everything for free. I’m self-taught and enjoy it. It became more and more popular and I think it shows I’m trying to show I’m a good person. “At the end of the day, I was a shoplter, not a paedophile or anything.” Kim, who says she started stealing  food and clothes aged just nine to help support her parents and eight younger siblings, considers shoplting an aposaddictionapos. She went on to steal  larger household goods, including ovens, chests of drawers and other furniture from well-known retailers across London.  The former criminal took clothes and designer bags as her obsession grew over the decades. She said: “It is an addiction. I was addicted, just like people can be addicted to drugs or food. I overcame it and so, since the fitness classes, I’ve also helped people cope with addictions, which can be bad in times like lockdown. “These people are inspired by my journey. It’s strangers again who are addicted to anything, whether that be drugs, food or drink or whatever and I just help them.

Don’t cover the buggy Parents often put a blanket or cover over their babyaposs pram in the hope it will keep their child out of the sun, but a paediatrician has warned it could actually heat up the buggy like a thermos.

Check their bedding The NHS advises keeping nightwear and bedclothes to a minimum for young children. Remove heavy bedding and do not cover your child when itaposs hot. It states: If your baby kicks or pushes off the covers during the night, consider putting them in just a nappy with a single well-secured sheet that will not work loose and cover their face or get entangled during the night.  Put ice in your babyaposs room Freezing bottles of water and placing them in your childaposs room at night can help to cool the air as they melt overnight.Placing them in front of a fan will also help lower the temperature of the air circulating the room, as reported by The Sun.Never leave them in the car Temperatures can soar in cars in an instant so never leave them alone in a vehicle for any amount of time, no matter how quick you plan to be. Also try to limit long drives and use plenty of breaks to cool off. Use flannels to cool them down Soak a flannel in cool water and dab it on your childaposs head and hands to help reduce their temperature. You can also give them a slightly cooler bath before bed to refresh them, but make sure itaposs quick to ensure they donapost get too cold.  Think about their clothes If their bedroom or your home traps heat and itaposs over C indoors, a nappy and a thin vest is probably all you need. When they go out in the sun, make sure their skin is covered when possible, but that the fabric is breathable and light. Use a paddling poolYou should keep small children out of the sun where possible and set up a paddling pool for them to enjoy the fresh air and cool down.

The rates are calculated by the government based on the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in a place per , members of the public. While the rates will inevitably rise unless a town or city has a signicant population increase, the pace of infection may be a cause of concern. Several of the areas have seen a double digit increase in their rates compared to yesterday, signalling dozens of new infections in the last day. Despite the rising figures, cases and deaths, most of the locations have not been subject to more stringent lockdown measures.

The remains of Hungarian national Henriett Szucs and mother-of-three Mihrican Mustafa were discovered by police in a flat in Canning Town, east London, on April , . Zahid Younis, , who was the occupant of the one-bedroom, ground-floor flat where the two women were found, is on trial for two counts of murder. The two women had been missing for a long time before the grim discovery. Ms Szucs had last been seen in August  and Ms Mustafa in May . On the first day of his trial at Southwark Crown Court, the jury was told the alleged victims had been subject to very signicant violence.  Prosecutor Duncan Penny QC said that Younis had bought the freezer a short time after the death of Ms Szucs for the sole purpose of concealing her body. Mr Penny said police had gone to the property looking for Younis when one found a lockable freezer in a cupboard which had flies around it and items stacked on top. The bodies were discovered after the officers forced the lid of the freezer with a crowbar. Prior to their death each of them had been the victim of signicant injury, each of them appeared to have been subject to very signicant violence, Mr Penny said. The women, both in their s at the time of their disappearances, had suffered numerous rib fractures, while Ms Szucs had sustained dreadful head injuries and Ms Mustafaaposs sternum and larynx had been fractured, Mr Penny said. Ms Szucsapos blood was found on the carpet of the flat and Ms Mustafaaposs fingerprint on the oven, Mr Penny said.  The court heard that between their deaths and the discovery of the bodies, there were periods when the electricity supply to the flat had been cut off - causing the bodies to start to decompose. By April , Younis had allegedly become so paranoid about the smell in the flat and the possibility the freezer would be discovered that he had abandoned the address. When he was detained, Younis told police: Itaposs my house, itaposs my problem, no-one  is involved. He later gave a no comment interview. The court heard the two women were known to have associated with Younis in the weeks leading up to their disappearances, and belongings of each of them were found in the flat. Both were vulnerable women living somewhat chaotic lives, including periods of homelessness and class A drug addiction, Mr Penny added. Ms Szucs had met the defendant while both were patients at the Royal London Hospital.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex travelled to Botswana in  just months after going on their first romantic date in London. Using the trip as a chance to get to know one-another, Meghan and Harry spent five nights away from their luxury log cabins in the wilderness to camp alone. According to new biography Finding Freedom, Harry was delightfully surprised by how down-to-earth Meghan was when it came to roughing-it for the week. The Duchess reportedly packed very little clothing and cleaned her face with baby wipes and happily wandered into the woodlandsshe needed a bathroom break. Harry and Meghan were said to have bonded over their love of nature during the trip, and the pair ed a year later after getting engaged to work with elephant conservation groups. A friend of the couple said: The fact that theyaposre both as happy just throwing on a backpack and going out to eplore...I honestly think these experiences will never stop for them. Finding Freedom, co-authored by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, has been publicly released today. It documents the fairytale start of Meghanaposs entry into the royal family - to their stepping down as senior royals and move to America.The book also looks at other members of the royal family and their relationship with Meghan and Harry throughout their romance. It is suggested in the explosive new read that Meghan felt disappointed Kate Middleton didnapost reach out and offer her any advise on how an outsider could cope with a new royal role.

Mum Gemma Markland, , spent months trawling shops for pink and rose gold furnishings before she had even bought her first house - a £, four bedroom detached property in Wigan, Greater Manchester - in September . Busy painting the previously white walls within two hours of receiving the house keys, Gemma is now happily ensconced in her pink palace with her husband, Kyle, , who works in sales and her daughter, Grace, , from a previous relationship. Delighted with her rose coloured theme throughout - seen everywhere from the wallpaper to the chairs and lampshades - her Instagram page, following her progress, has almost , fans, and attracts around  new followers a day. Gemma said: “I must have spent about £, on accessories and furnishings to make my house  per cent pink. “I do try to save where I can, though, so everything has been DIY. For the past  months, we have dedicated spare moments, like evenings and weekends, to redecorating.“Kyle laughs at me, as I will happily spend £, on a table to make sure it’s the perfect shade of pink, but I won’t pay for someone to do our wallpapering.” Gemma, who owns her own company making bespoke bridal gowns, has given a whole new meaning to putting your own stamp on a place after years of having her creative flair stled by tenancy agreements restricting redecoration, when she lived in rented accommodation. She continued: “Everything when I rented was grey – it wasn’t me at all.”  So when, in early , she and Kyle had their offer of £, accepted on their current home, months before moving in, her mind turned to decorating. And she only had one hue in mind. “I’ve always loved pink – but the blush and rose gold tones, rather than the Barbie bubblegum pink,” she explained.  “Kyle and I even had a blush and rose gold colour scheme at our wedding so, of course, there was only one colour I wanted to decorate our first home. “At first, he wasn’t on board with living in a pink house, so I told him it’d just be Grace’s bedroom and my office. “As soon as I started buying accessories, though, he changed his mind. Everybody always asks me how I got my husband to agree to live in this pink paradise, but he likes it and thinks it looks great.”  After meticulously scouring furniture and home accessory stores, Gemma accumulated an impressive array of pink treasures. She continued: “It took me months. I built things up bit by bit, buying things I liked whenever I saw them. “Because I was working to such a strict theme, I was quite limited with where we could shop.  “I usually searched by colour first, then looked within those results for things I liked. On a couple of occasions, I fell in love with a piece of furniture that didn’t come in pink, so I bought it anyway then spray painted it. “I found some paint from BQ that was the perfect rose gold shade.” Given that she did everything herself, with some help from her family, Gemma’s renovation progressed remarkably quickly.  Just before moving in, she set up an Instagram page called The Markland Home – mostly so she could have a place to keep her photos and look back on how far she had come. To her surprise, her picture diary went down a storm, gathering followers in their thousands, who flocked to her page to see what she would post next. “I still can’t quite believe I’m at nearly , followers,” she said. “I never thought I’d even get ,. “I wanted to show people what the reality of buying and decorating a new build was like, but I think the fact my house is completely pink is really unique and catches people’s eyes when they’re scrolling.  “People tell me my pictures are very aesthetically pleasing, which makes me happy, as the showroom look is exactly what I was going for. “Grace absolutely loves it, too, and is always telling people to follow me.” Gemma is delighted with her furniture, which mostly comes from Ikea and her soft furnishings, which are from a wide range of stores, but her favourite spot in the house is her dressing room.  As well as a pink carpet, rug, plush chair and several stylish decorations, it also houses a huge wardrobe, with all her perfectly presented blush-toned clothes on display. She also loves the pink marble-effect wallpaper in her bedroom, bought online from Wallpaper Sales, and her blush-toned sofa. “Because I display my pink clothes and pack everything  away in drawers, it looks like I have a  per cent pink wardrobe,” she said. “Actually, I don’t wear as much pink as you’d think. I’m not quite at that level yet – I’ve got blue jeans and dark t shirts like everybody . “Similarly, I posted a picture of my car not long ago, which is blue and I got so many comments saying how surprised people were that I didn’t have a pink car.” "},{"url":null,"title":"people should wear face masks","story":"NewsPeople should wear face masks during sex and avoid kissing, says sexual health charityThe Terrence Higgins Trust has released guidelines of safely having sex during the coronavirus pandemic, admitting it is no longer realistic to advise people to refrain from sex as measures are easedShareByRyan Merrield:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video coronavirus-latest-number-deaths-cases-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Research suggests Brits have been abiding by common sense during the pandemic with the number of people taking new sexual partners having dropped considerably. In fact, THT said  percent had managed to avoid the temptation to go outside the home for sex due to restrictions, since March. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE  However, it accepts that coming up to five months since Boris Johnson locked down the UK, and with measures continuing to be eased, it is unrealistic to ask people to refrain from sex completely.But guidance does point out sex with yourself or someone you live with is most advisable. Masturbation, using sex toys or participating in phone or online sex are recommended as the safest options, as these can be done at a distance from others. If having sex with someone outside of your household, the charity advised having one regular partner or limiting the number of sexual partners as well as taking other precautions.  Potential sexual partners should discuss Covid- and askthey or anyone in their household have had symptoms or tested positive. The charity also recommends not having sexyou feel unwell and to isolateyou have symptoms. Sexual partners are advised to wash their hands for  seconds before and after sex to help reduce the risk. Due to the ways Covid- is spread, the charity further recommends not kissing and wearing a face covering during intercourse. The charity also advises picking positions where participants are not face to face.  Sexually active people are also advised to use condoms as well as dams for activities such as rimming, as the Covid- virus is thought to be found in some bodily fluids. THTaposs medical director Dr Michael Brady said: Sex is a very important part of le and asking people to avoid sex indefinitely is not realistic. Thataposs why, as the Covid- pandemic continues, we all need to find ways to balance our need for sex and intimacy with the risks of the spread of Covid-.

Another source told the book: Harry was upset that it was playing out so publicly and that so much of the information being reported was wrong. There had been moments where he felt people working with his brother had put things out to make William look good, evenit meant throwing Harry under the bus. It was a confusing time, and his head was all over the place - he didnapost know who or what to believe, and he and William werenapost talking enough either, which made everything a lot worse. The fallout between the two men was so serious it was openly discussed at a staff retreat in , the book claims. An insider tells the authors: Itaposs no secret, the future of this monarchy relies solely on the four people currently in Kensington Palace.  The public popularity only lies with them. When he [the Prince of Wales] becomes King, the only way it lasts isthe four of them are not at war. We cannot have them at war. The book also gives details of some of the issues which led to the tension between William and Harry, with particular focus on one comment the elder brother made about Meghan. In the early days of their relationship, the Cambridges were keen to meet the woman who had captured Harryaposs hearts, so they set up a meeting at Kensington Palace. But commenting on the first meeting, Scobie and Durand write that Kate is an extremely guarded person who keeps a very tight group of friends.

Tuesday is set for highs of C as the latest scorching heatwave continues, but thunderstorms are moving across all of the UK - with temperatures to plummet later in the week.The Met Officeaposs countrywide yellow weather warnings remain in place until Friday morning, with a small chance of fast flowing or deep floodwater causing danger to le.While the Scottish Environment Protection Agency has issued  flood alerts, which add to the one in place via Natural Resources Wales and the Environment Agencyaposs five for England. Added to that, four flood warnings are in place across Lancaster and Ulverston in the north west. An EA flood report states river levels have risen at the Fitz Bridge and Burrow Beck river gauges as a result of localised thunderstorms yesterday. Consequently, flooding of property is possible, it added. Met Office chief meteorologist Steve Ramsdale said the worst of the thunderstorms are likely to occur in the north west of England, North Wales and the West Midlands. Here, exceptional rainfall totals could be seen of mm in an hour with a very small chance of mm of rainfall in three or four hours, he said. While EA flood duty manager Caroline Douglass warned: Isolated flooding is also possible more widely across England today through until Thursday due to further heavy thunderstorms. According to BBC weather charts, London will see a scorching starting temperature of C today and sunshine will just shoot up again like a rocket, according to Beeb forecaster Tomasz Schafernaker.  Generally speaking, there is going to be a lot of sunshine across the UK on Tuesday and just hit and miss thunderstorms here and there, he continued. Wednesday could see temperatures get even hotter before a major plummet of C by Friday. After Wednesday, that really hot day, Thursday is going to be the day when those temperatures really start to come down across the south east, East Anglia and central parts of England, added Mr Schafernaker.

The Lebanese capital, once called the Paris of the Middle East, became synonymous with a brutal civil war, the kidnapping of Terry Waite and bullet-scarred buildings. And now the phrase is sadly relevant again after a blast last week killed more than , injured , and left , homeless. How much heartache can one nation take  Rubber bullets and tear gas were used on Beirutis who took to the streets at the weekend to voice their anger at the corruption and incompetence of the political ruling class that let , tonnes of ammonium nitrate sit unguarded at the port for six years, despite warnings. Yesterday, all members of the Government – an uneasy alliance between Lebanon’s largest Christian-majority party, the Free Patriotic Movement and the Iranian-backed Shia militia Hezbollah –stepped down. PM Hassan Diab, who is a Sunni Muslim but is backed by Hezbollah, said his cabinet now assumes a caretaker role until a new government is formed. Sweeping away the regime may appease public anger but it will not rebuild this shattered and battered country or stave off impending bankruptcy. Lebanon needs at least £billion to repair the blast’s damage. But it needs more to stabilise its currency, reform its bureaucracy and make modern business possible again. What happens now for Lebanon relies on the efforts of President Emmanuel Macron of France, a country with close ties to its former colony, to help it navigate this political vacuum and ensure the days of civil war, clashes with Israel and interference by Iran, Saudi Arabia and Syria are kept at bay. And what happens later this month at the UN Special Tribunal to find those behind the  suicide bombing that killed Sunni billionaire and former PM Rafik Hariri is also incredibly important for loosening Hezbolllah’s grip on the country.  Four alleged members are on trial in absentia after leader Hassan Nasrallah refused to hand them over. “Hezbollah is putting its hands on the whole country,” protester Zeina Jaffar, , said. “We don’t want it any more. We hate Hezbollah. We just want peace, food, jobs.” Macron is also overseeing fundraising. Britain has pledged £million with the total raised so far topping £million. Tens of thousands also back a petition calling for Lebanon to be ed to French control. It is hard to pinpoint where it all went wrong, ­particularly as the country was thriving in recent years. To understand this tragedy, you need to start with a brief history of the country’s tumultuous past. Beirut’s glamour and glitz was turned on its head in , when a -year civil war broke out, creating isions that would linger for years.  I was born in , in Bedford, after my Lebanese dad met my mum at a nightclub in the town. I was three weeks old when we moved to Beirut. It is a complicated place where bikinis and hijabs coexist, and tempers and passion can collide. But it has a tremendous heart. It is a place where dollars are accepted everywhere and nearly everybody speaks English, as well as French. It is a frenetic place with constant horn-honking from everything from battered old Mercedes taxis to blinged-up sports cars. If you don’t fall in love with it, you’ve failed to let the place get under your skin. When my uncle Sami became a casualty of the war in , my family ed to Bedford. Lebanon finally stumbled out of that brutal civil war but two Israeli invasions and bombing campaigns followed. Political assassinations decimated the progressives, notably Hariri, the man credited with ending the civil war and the architect of rebuilding downtown Beirut.  His death in  sparked the Cedar Revolution in which a million took to the streets, leading to the end of  years of Syrian occupation. Lebanon started to recover, marketed globally again as a place where you can ski in the morning and sunbathe on Mediterranean beaches in the afternoon. Tourist numbers were up and the middle classes seemed more comfortable than ever. But then, Syria exploded into war, sending . million refugees its way, adding to , Palestinians. The country weathered this storm but was then walloped with another last year. The corrupt warlords who have governed the country since the end of the civil war in , in a precarious power-sharing agreement which balances political control between the  dferent sects, put Lebanon in debt up to its eyeballs.

The nation had previously managed to keep the number of infections relatively low when compared to Spain, Italy and France. Greece had just , confirmed cases but yesterdayaposs figure of  is the countryaposs highest daily total since the beginning of the year. However the increase has not stopped Brits from flocking to the countryaposs holiday islands. According to Skyscanner searches for flights to Crete, Corfu and Santorini have overtaken Spanish destinations such as Ibiza and Malaga, the Sun reports. Greek government officials have been out in force on Mykonos after large gatherings and beach parties sparked fears of an outbreak on the island. A beach bar was closed and locals and tourists were forced to take tests with  people told they must self-isolate eventhey give a negative result. Brits are currently able to holiday in Greece without having to quarantine when theyto the UK. But they must fill in a Passenger Locator Form  hours before travelling to Greece.  They will then be sent a QR code before travelling which they must be shown when they arrive in Greece. If they donapost they could be sent back to the UK or face a huge fine. However some travellers have reported problems with the forms. Some have claimed they didnapost receive the code or their tour operator didnapost inform them about the form.  Brits going to Greece with Wizz Air have been urged to take extra care after  travellers at Luton were not allowed to fly because of aposmistakesapos on their form. Two were stopped from flying because they failed to enter their middle names on the form and blasted the airline as they claimed that the form said it was optional, the Independent reports. Harry Young and his partner were among the holidaymakers set to fly from Luton to Athens. He told The Independent that they were forced to fork out an extra £ travel with a dferent airline instead.  Other holidaymakers have complained about similar experiences online. One fuming traveller tweeted: @Wizzair you are an absolute joke of an airline. Refused to let me on the plane for my holiday this morning because I didn’t fill out my initial for Covid form. BUT IT SAYS ITS OPTIONAL AS I EXPLAINED  TIMES TO THE RUDE STAFF @ LUTON AIRPORT. A Wizz Air spokesman confirmed that  travellers were stopped from flying.  He added: “Wizz Air reminds passengers that it is their responsibility to complete a PLF with all the necessary information to be allowed to fly to Greece. “Passengers who do not complete the form or do so incorrectly will be refused carriage, and are not entitled to compensation.” France could be the next holiday destination to be removed from the air bridge list after an alarming spike in Covid- cases - , were confirmed on Friday. Thousands of holidaymakers already in France and many more about to head across the Channel could face two weeks in quarantine on the Government acts.

I still wanted to go back home for a few weeks to a month but unfortunately I cannot do that this summer.“It is what it is but I love staying in Dundee and staying in Scotland and enjoying all the things we have to do here because it is such a beautul place.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

There#s a lot of offers going around, a lot of properties going on the market, people who are wanting to move but haven#t been able to over the past few weeks.#July into August has been very busy. That pent up demand should get back to the new normal in a few months.#Mr Fraser said he didn#t believe the local lockdown in Aberdeen would have too much of an effect on sales.He said: #We are still allowed to view propertiesthey are vacant, orthe owners are able to do viewings with masks or leaving the property, that#s possible as well.#It#s not a complete lockdown, but certainly it will slow the market.#I would imagine the LBTT will help, it#s an incentive which will continue until March, but at that time who knows what it will be like.#The main message is that it#s been very quiet during lockdown, but it#s been very buoyant since which is positive.#John MacRae, chairman of ASPC, said: #There has been a sizeable backlog of delayed completions, caused by the #first# lockdown, so a good number of sales since restrictions were eased are, in reality, sales from earlier in the year.#What is clear however, on sales, is that activity has resumed and on a fairly good level.#I can say that we have been encouraged by levels of activity. Insertions are at a normal level and there does seem to be an increase in buying activity.#On sales however, we do have to be careful in case levels of activity are inflated by a catching up for lost time syndrome. It will probably take to late September before we can begin to discern any meaningful statistics.#I do not expect the current #second# lockdown to impact at all,it lasts only for seven days. Longer than that it is almost bound to have some impact as properties coming to market will slow as home reports cannot be provided.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July . Subject to the confirmation of phase three from that date, the canals will open to navigation as follows:While boats will be able to transit the canals, the operating hours and days still have to be confirmed#When the canals were closed to navigation at the beginning of lockdown, mooring customers received three months# navigation licence free of charge to June .Scottish Canals added: #We have decided to extend the concession to cover July, with mooring customers getting a credit note issued to their account next month in addition to April, May and June.#A deferment of boat safety certicates has also been further extended until September.With health and safety in mind, Scottish Canals will adopt strict social distancing, segregation and hygiene measures to minimise the risk of transmitting Covid- for the foreseeable future, including cough screens at transaction points, queue management and clear signage to remind people of the importance of physical distancing and good hand and cough hygiene."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor july 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Communities on the A are blighted by the noise of bikers, many with illegal exhausts.Inveraray is the gathering point for motorcyclists and on a recent Saturday during lockdown around  were gathered, not two metre social distancing, and failing to adhere to the maximum eight in a group guidance.This has become the norm throughout the summer, and it seems lockdown guidance does not apply to bikers as they have been a constant feature on the roads, even in phase one.The unofficial Argyll TT goes past our homes most weekends over the spring and summer months.I have a bike licence and understand the feeling of freedom, but three-figure speeds past residential entrances, many of them hidden, is completely unacceptable.As a resident you begin to dread the weekend and sunny days. The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy. Teaching children the beauty of the outdoors and how to care for it can bring a lelong love for natureyou love something you usually wish to protect it.And learning never stops for any of us. Sometimes it is the basics that are needed before we move on to the complexities of natural navigation or learning our stars.So for this month here is one tip : learn how to go to the toilet in the outdoors!Doing this responsibly and teaching your children makes for a lelong enjoyment of walking and exploring without the bane of wondering where the next toilet is.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotland"},{"url":null,"title":"creative writing how to begin","story":"Kenneth StevenUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe last few months have been a dficult and unsettling time. But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

Work has continued since then to raise money to complete the project.With the cost of the original scheme estimated at £ million, the charity decided to scale back its ambitions and make it a phased project that could be added to as funding allowed.The first priority was to remove buildings containing asbestos on the newly-purchased site, at an estimated cost of £,.More than half of this sum was granted by the A#Chruach wind farm fund, provided by Ventient Energy, but the balance was still to be found and with the building warrant to remove the buildings running out in October time was getting short.That was when A and C Building Contractors Ltd, Kenneth James Construction Ltd and M Kerr Roofing stepped in to save the day.Andy Morrison and Craig Owen, of A and C Building Contractors Ltd, approached MAYDS centre manager Fiona Kalache to find out what was happening with the buildings and how the project was progressing. They decided to contact the other firms and they all agreed to help the charity by completeing the first phase of the project for the amount of money currently available.Andy and Craig explained: #MAYDS really helped us out when we were putting together our business plan and setting up so we wanted to say #thank you# and repay the favour. We are happy to be helping a local charity, especially when it is going to create something good for the community and youngsters in the area.#Kenny MacLeod added: #It is great to see something happening for young people and for Lochgilphead. Often it seems like lots of things are happening around Lochgilphead but never in the town itself, so this is an important development that will be really beneficial.#Fiona Kalache offered her thanks to the construction companies: #This is a huge relief as we have been struggling for some time to get funding for the full costs. The main thing was to get the buildings down before our building warrant ran out, giving us a clear site to start construction of the skate park.#These builders have gone out of their way to support us by doing work in kind and reducing costs so that we can now move forward with our planned development. We are so grateful to them for stepping in to support the young people of Mid Argyll and finally allowing their vision to progress. Thanks also have to go to A#Chruach wind farm. It has funded a signicant part of the costs quoted and have continued to support us throughout.#This will make a big dference to the lives of young people in the area. Many of them currently travel through to Dumbarton to access the type of facilities we hope to offer. We plan to use the back end of the site for basketball hoops and other play equipment and hope to attract children from all over Argyll, creating a fun, safe space for young people.#Once the site is cleared, security fencing and lighting will be installed. Then work will start on putting the steel skate park jumps and ramps in place. MAYDS would welcome any help to raise money to meet the cost of this work.MAYDS works with young people up to the age of  across Mid Argyll and Islay, offering training, support, youth clubs, drop-ins, cyber cafe, trips and much more. People receiving help include young carers, young parents, young people with disabilities and young people looking to engage in fun activities or access training courses.The skate park project has received support from Lochgilphead Community Council and from Mid Argyll members of Argyll and Bute Council.Betty Rhodick, Lochgilphead Community Council member on the A#Chruach wind farm fund , commented: #I am delighted to see things progressing.

In May, an Airdrie supermarket worker took photographs that he claimed showed a strange blueish-green \"flying saucer\" and a diamond-shaped cluster of \"neon beams\" while walking home from work.Here, we look atsome of our favourite tales of strange sightings in the sky.Seven of Scotlands strangest UFO sightings:West Lothian: A close encounterForestry worker Robert Taylor, below, found himself at the heart of one of Scotlands most famous UFO mysteries when he stumbled across\"a huge flying dome\" in a woodland clearing near Dechmont Law in Livingston on November , .As he approached the hovering object, two spheres, each about three feet wide with protruding metal spikes \"similar to sea mines\", dropped down and raced towards him.Members of the British UFO Research Association National Conference with Robert Taylor at the site he saw a UFO near Livingston, West Lothian, in Taylor claimed to have experienced an acrid smell and the sensation of being dragged.

I think it was Michael Gove who said, Your example gives us hope.

He was first alerted to something out of the ordinary by a humming noise, similar to that from high voltage power lines.Macpherson describes a sudden uneasy feeling as he turned towards the water to see the object coming towards him. He stood frozen, watching it for more than  minutes.According to his statement: \"The craft came close enough for me to see that it was definitely metallic and had several points of dfused light on its underside, inside a darker coloured rim.\"It was only as the disc flew off at high speed that Macpherson felt able to raise his camera and take two photographs. He said: \"The crafts acceleration was phenomenal ndash by the time Id wound the film on between the two shots, it was a mere dot in the sky.\"By his own admission, Macpherson had no interest in the subject of UFOs. Subsequent checks with the RAF, airports and the police, confirmed no known air traffic at the time."},{"url":null,"title":"12-natural-wonders-scotland-must-visit-lifetime","story":"Narrowing down a list of favourites was no easy task, but wersquove given it a bash, bringing together a mix of well-known spots and lesser-visited gems deserving of more column inches.If you are heading out to explore this weekend, herersquos some mesmerising and memorable locations courtesy of Mother Nature.Here are  natural wonders of Scotland:Eshaness, ShetlandYou can feel the raw power of nature pulsating from what has been described as one of the most high energy coastlines in the world.

Amanda had been diagnosed in November  and given  weeks to live.David and Trevor are raising money for Pancreatic Cancer UK after Trevor was diagnosed with an aggressive form of the condition in November last year,  months after Amanda.His diagnosis is terminal and he has received  chemotherapy sessions.Trevor was also given  weeks to live but chose to go through treatment to extend his le.He is receiving more treatment in September.This is not the first time that the pair have embarked on a tour like this and it was this previous trip that inspired them to go again.In Christmas , David received a present to go on a motorbike ride and the following February he left with Trevor to go on a -day tour around Europe.However, they were on their trip during the Beast from the East snowstorm of early , which saw them ride through snow in mainland Europe.David, who owns a couple of coffee shops in London, said: ldquoWe went through the Swiss Alps, France and Italy and people were following us through France and beeping their horns at us, so we said thatwe ever do this again that we must do it for charity.The pair then set up their own website, called the Hairless Bikers www.hairlessbikers, inspired by lsquoHairy Bikersrsquo David Myers and Si King with their own twist, as both David and Trevor are bald.The pair were planning their next trip until Amandarsquos terminal diagnosis, with David saying the news came ldquoall of a sudden.After Amandarsquos death, David spent time dealing and coming to terms with his loss and then Trevor received his diagnosis.And when the coronavirus pandemic started earlier this year, it added to an already dficult year.The pair were waiting for Trevor to finish his chemotherapy before starting the tour, with Trevor phoning David last month and askinghe wanted to go.David told the Courier before he set off: ldquoWersquove always said we will do it but now itrsquos all go.ldquoTrevor phoned me last weekend and said: lsquoLetrsquos just do it.rsquo If we donrsquot do it now then itrsquos never going to happen.ldquoWe thought about all of the news going on at the moment andanything happens or we need to come back we are just in Europe so can easily catch a plane home.Ahead of the trip, David said he was ldquovery excited, adding he was just going to focus on riding and see what happened.He added: ldquoWe wonrsquot stop laughing, wersquoll be like little kids.An initial target of pound was raised, with more than pound, raised in a few days.David saidan average of pound a day could be raised ldquothat will be brilliant.Donate at www.facebook donate  "},{"url":null,"title":"column-tory-disarray-not-reassuring","story":"It cannot be reassuring for the Scottish Tories that their leader has only been in the position since February and has now left the party in disarray.It is clear the party do not hold Scottish Parliament seats in a high regard, given that it is looking likely that the next leader will be Douglas Ross, who is not even currently an MSP.Scottish Parliament seats require a member who is willing to commit time and effort to their constituency, they are not simply a stepping stone for jumping into a leadership bid.If you compare the Toriesrsquo leadership with that of Nicola Sturgeon over the last few months, with her clear and consistent messaging throughout the Covid- crisis, it is easy to see why polls for the SNP and independence are through the roof.I know that many are looking forward to enjoying the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, which will offer discounts of up to  per cent at restaurants and cafeacutes throughout August.I welcome this help for local businesses, and I am sure that this will benefit them in their restarts following lockdown.I would like to stress, however, that guidelines should always be followed within these establishments.That means that you should be socially distancing from those who are not from your household or extended household, and you should maintain good hygiene by regularly washing your hands for  seconds, as well as not touching your face.To keep yourself safe, it is important to use businesses that are taking these measures seriously and putting safety precautions in place to protect their customers.This week I will be hosting the first meeting of the Esk River Improvement Group.I look forward to working with them to make progress towards cleaning up the Esk."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-mist-midges-memories","story":"Oh and I forgot to mention the midges, which add a particularly Highland flavour to any camping trip up north.Such was our experience last weekend after we managed to find a campsite that was open. We managed just one overnight stay in Glen Nevis.It has always been a favourite glen of mine.Its beauty challenges the majestic Glencoe, but its landscape is gentler and less rugged, and the upper reaches of the glen take you back in time, to the majesty of the ancient Caledonian forest.In the days when I was a tour guide, I always thought that mist and rain were an essential part of a trip to the Highlands.People would refer to hot and sunny weather as good weather, but Irsquod always say that in the Highlands mist and rain can be good weather too.On such days, the weather would add the veil of mystery and unpredictability that makes the landscape so intriguing.Hardly ever was the approach to Glencoe the same because of the weather it changes the landscape in ways the imagination could never predict.Swirling mists which dress the peaks, layers of low lying cloud which suddenly break to allow sparkling rays of sunshine itrsquos spine-tinglingly magical.On days of so called good weather, when the skies were a cloudless blue, I always felt there was something missing in the experience.I know all this might sound like patter from VisitScotland attempting to persuade rain drenched tourists that they are lucky to have experienced the true mystery of our country but for me it has always been true.Of course, days of endless pelting rain are no fun and can spoil a holiday, but for me, some mist and rain, in moderation, makes a Highland holiday all the more memorable.Such was our experience last weekend, with two days that seemed to be in dferent seasons.When we arrived we were lucky to be able to put up the tent just in time, before the rain got heavy.Itrsquos always an awkward moment for me putting up our tent in full view of other campers, as we struggle to remember which pole goes where and try not to look like we need assistance.It couldrsquove been easy to be despondent at the weather. Dark brooding clouds shrouded the sides of Ben Nevis, bringing rain that threatened to dampen everything but I refused to let it dampen our spirits.I recited the famous quote: ldquoIn Scotland there is no such thing as bad weather just bad clothing.We had a hearty camp stove meal and then set off for our walk in the Nevis Gorge.Itrsquos a well kent walk now, but when I was first taken many years ago before the internet it was a relatively unknown secret. I still remember the sense of awe as I heard the roar of the river below, and the sight of the distant waterfall An Steall as we emerged from the gorge.Our trick was to go on our walk when it was raining, and after teatime so we had the place almost to ourselves, well apart from the midges.Our midge repellent was gold dust, and Irsquove always found the trick in avoiding midges is to keep moving, which we did, except for once, and we momentarily paid the price.It was a walk in the childhood footsteps of my younger self, where my young children were re-pacing along the route also taken by their older siblings years ago.It was about saying ldquohere is a place important to me, part of who I am itrsquos yours now,you want it to be.Yet not saying it with words, but by making memories that I hope will last as long as mine have.The rain and mist was all part of it, and yes even the midges. As often happens, the weather began to clear as we headed back.The sun broke through and the clouds developed a sparkling yellow tint. The mountains appeared, like giants awoken and rising to their true height.Sunshine briefly warmed our faces and it seemed a gt from the gods for our endurance.The kids danced and sang the song ldquoI can see clearly now the rain has gone as they saw a rainbow.I knew the rain hadnrsquot really gone so we didnrsquot dally.We made it back to the car, tired with sore legs, but before the next dark cloud arrived.That evening we recounted our experiences in the tent, and I told stories about the Jacobites and the old Highland way of le, and the connection to the Battle of Prestonpans on our own doorstep.The kids listened, partly because we were camping and they had no screens, so no choice but Irsquod like to believe partly also because we were in a land where stories and legends are steeped in the soil and they now felt a small part of them.It lashed with rain all night. But its rage had ended by morning and the new day welcomed us with sunshine.New adventures beckoned, with other memories to impart, on what was to become our sunny day.Loch Oich, rich in family memory and where the ashes of both my parents were scattered.Then Loch Ness, a fitting end to a pilgrimage, especially for my monster daft wee boy, and his sisters who love the mystery of the story.Such was our short ldquostaycation this summer.Wersquod followed what I have always called The Road of Legends which is the title of my yet to be published novel, an abridged version of which will be serialised on this page very soon."},{"url":null,"title":"column-tourist-home-help-love-area","story":"I WAS on holiday a couple of weeks ago and on one of the days I went to the local amenity

morning cycle.As I came out from Musselburgh Lagoons towards the mouth of the Esk, I saw the magnicent sight of all the seabirds, the swans and the geese gathered at that point where river meets sea.It occurred to me then that my best holiday this year could be to live in my own place as though I were a tourist.In my own hometown, I can still be awed by unexpected beauty, delighted by the

Cambio didnrsquot survive but while it did its owner had a ball.What is clear from The Scandal of the Century is its authorrsquos relish for a form that requires its practitioners to be multi-talented and endlessly adaptable. The best journalists ndash and on this evidence Maacuterquez fully merits his place at the table ndash are insatiably curious and find everything fascinating, from the earth-shattering to the seemingly banal. He was a huge fan of Hemingway, who also wrote for newspapers before turning to fiction. Once upon a time in Paris, Maacuterquez spotted his hero on Bouled Saint-Michel. What should he do  Don his literary beret and express his ldquounconditional admiration or try to interview him as any self-respecting hack would  What he did was cup his hands and, ldquolike Tarzan in the jungle, bellow from one side of the street to the other, ldquoMaeeeeestro! Hemingway responded: ldquoAdioacuteoacuteoacuteoacutes, amigo.Though born in Colombia, Maacuterquez spent a good part of his le as a roving reporter in Austria, France and Italy. In From Paris, With Love, he recalls arriving in  and seeing people kissing everywhere in contrast to Bogotaacute ldquowhere it was even dficult to kiss in bedrooms. It was the time of the Algerian War, when it was the norm for anyone who ldquodidnrsquot have a Christian face to be slung into jail. The police thought he was Algerian even though he looked like ldquoa door-to-door salesman. It was, he writes ruefully, the only revolution for which he was ever imprisoned.While his career as a novelist burgeoned and critical and commercial success beckoned, Maacuterquez never forsook journalism and was forthright in denouncing General Pinochet in Chile and in his support of Fidel Castro. He was deeply critical of the US blockade of Cuba and consequently mocked as an idiot savant by hawkish Republicans. In The Cubans Face the Blockade, he reports on the effect the embargo had on the population. Even clothes were rationed. At first nine items were rationed which was upped to  within a year. Toys were next. But there was an upside: that Christmas was the first in the history of Cuba when every child received a toy.The eponymous piece recounts the story of how the mysterious death in  of a young Italian woman sparked a scandal that reached deep into Italian society and showed a more sordid side to La Dolce Vita. It runs to some  pages and Maacuterquez spins it like a thriller, artfully reminding less attentive readers to pay attention to salient facts.Several of the pieces relate to writing. All are required reading. In Misadventures of a Writer of Books, he refers to his occupation as ldquosuicidal. Most readers, he suggests, have no idea of the effort and anguish that goes into producing a book and the meagre reward their creators receive. He estimates that a good writer needs at least two years and , cigarettes to produce a book of  pages. So why write  ldquoYoursquore a writer in the very same way you might be Jewish or black."},{"url":null,"title":"blackness-isnt-monolith","story":"TELEVISION has the power to spark nationwide discussion about poignant ndash and often, uncomfortable ndash topics.

Exams having been cancelled, thanks to the pandemic, Scottish school teachers were given the delicate task of imagining what their charges might have achieved had the tests taken place. Teachers in some of the most deprived areas gave what could only be called optimistic estimates of their students likely attainment in the Highers ndash about % higher than in previous years.The Scottish Qualications Authority, SQA, which is supposed to ensure fair play in assessment, took one look at this unprecedented grade inflation and said: Youre not on. Schools were estimating examination success wildly out of step with their own recent performance.:Iain Macwhirter: Heres how a New Union could keep us living apart togetherSo the SQA moderators took an axe to the results to make them look a bit more credible. The results in the poorer postcodes went down by %, which still left grades inflated over previous years. In the more affluent schools, where estimated grades were around % above par, they adjusted scores by %.Thats an oversimplication, but in a sense it doesnt matter. What it looked like was the SQA brutally crushing the hopes and dreams of poor students while only marginally reducing the scores of pupils in the posher colleges.Assessment by algorithm is always going to be a poor fit with reality. So, Shaun did well in his prelims, but he might have coasted the rest of the year whereas Siobhan got such a shock that she worked her derriere off for the next six months. Why are they both being cut down I mean, arent teachers themselves the best judge of performance  Why didnt the SQA just suck it up, accept that this was an exceptional year and that Covid  engendered a study revolution in less advantaged neighbourhoods.:Iain Macwhirter: Sturgeon should bring Salmond in from the cold ndash hersquos just too dangerousThats what the educational experts on Twitter argued, including the outspoken educational pundit, James McEnany. They complained that most of the , pupils who had their futures stolen were from working class neighbourhoods and that this confirmed education is biased to the rich.The consultant, Sir Keir Bloomer, who helped devise the Curriculum for Excellence, disagreed insisting that the adjustment process was ldquojustied and necessary. And the First Minister agreed. She said bluntly that the estimates submitted by teachers were simply ldquonot credible. Accepting grade inflation on that scale would bring the entire standardised assessment into disrepute.This was Nicola Sturgeon trying to be wise before the event. Sure, the estimates were doing wonders for the attainment gap. She couldve gone into the May Holyrood elections saying that she had delivered the greatest narrowing of the educational class gap in history. But the First Minister is much too canny.Students who narrowly failed last year would be furious for a start. The very people now berating her for crushing the hopes and dreams of the less well off would be attacking her for undermining the credibility of Scottish education. Ms Sturgeon would have been accused of closing the attainment gap by fraud.The More or Less programme on BBC Radio would be calling it the most shocking misuse of statistics since the UK government claimed that it was conducting , Covid  tests a day, when all it was doing was sending out kits.But the ldquoclassist accusations wont go away. A hundred or so young people gathered in George Square holding banners saying ldquoTrust our Teachers and ldquoI am not my postcode. Sturgeon is being called the ldquograde snatcher, echoing the claim that Mrs Thatcher was the ldquomilk snatcher.Part of the problem is that the SQA seems incapable of giving a coherent and convincing explanation of its methodology. Tens of thousands of appeals are expected against what parents regard as an arbitrary and unfair process that took no account of real pupil attainment.The Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, is in for a torrid time. Indeed, he has been having a torrid time for as long as I can remember. There has been persistent grumbling about the Curriculum for Excellence which seems anything but. The PISA international performance scores have gone south. Standardised testing of primary one children led to accusations of child abuse. Progress on the attainment gap has been glacially slow.Mr Swinney held out against the teachers % pay demand just long enough for teachers to threaten a strike, at which point he gave in and awarded them an eye-popping .% over three years. Nice work.Last month, parents across Scotland revolted at pandemic plans to give children as little as one day a week of ldquoblended learning. That forced an embarrassing U-turn as Mr Swinney promised full-time, full-fat education from this month onwards.:Iain Macwhirter: Does Nicola Sturgeon still want independence  Some in the SNP arent so sureBut the Educational Institute for Scotland says that only a fth of their members are confident itrsquos safe to reopen the schools. Its still not clear what is going to happen this week. Will teachers turn up  Will parents send their children We appear to be seeing,not the second wave of Covid, then the long tail of the first wave. Lockdown is in the air again. Its conceivable that children couldto school just long enough to exchange infections before being sent home again.Its not Mr Swinneys fault of course. This is a pandemic after all. Teachers unions have the Scottish Government over a barrel ndash and they know it. Parents are incensed as only parents can be when they feel their offspring are being treated unfairly.But it might be time to put poor John Swinney out of his misery. The Deputy First Minister has been a sterling defender of the First Minister, the ultimate safe pair of hands. But those hands arent looking so safe any more. He is beginning to look like a work horse that has taken more beating than it can stand.A fresh face,such a thing exists in the  year old Scottish Government, in charge of the education brief might help get the government over this hurdle. In the last SQA exams crisis in  the then Labour education minister, Sam Galbraith, had to step down after being mauled by, er, one Nicola Sturgeon.The SNP is streets ahead in the polls and that is unlikely to change any time soon, given the dire state of the opposition parties in Scotland. But there are a lot more parents in Scotland than there are teachers. It would only take a few thousand parental votes to go astray in May to deprive Nicola Sturgeon of that absolute majority she needs for an independence referendum.This is a full scale crisis, possibly Nicola Sturgeons worst yet. Young people are up in arms. The teaching profession is in a state of perennial discontent. The very credibility of standardised assessment may be in doubt.

Parents, students and teachers highlight the failure of the system to recognise the hard work of learners, their application and commitment to task, together with their personal and academic problem-solving abilities ndash all skills and qualities that modern employers tell us they value most. On the other hand, politicians and examination body spokespersons emphasise their statistical processes and historical comparisons.A quarter of candidates this year have been told: Sorry, but you are not as good as youthink you are. We the \"system\" know better ndash because we have a model wersquove used before. These are the same young people ndash and their parents ndash that,Scotland is to compete successfully in the st century world, we need to convince of the value of a lelong commitment to education and training. How exactly does this contribute to reducing the attainment gap and promoting a \"can do\" culture This debacle was not an accident, the consequence of an aberrant computer glitch or systems personnel mals. The process of assessment and grading worked this year exactly as intended and designed by the examination body and politicians. Every year candidate results are manipulated, by the same process, to fit the demands of the normal curve of distribution ndash a statistical process increasingly regarded as spurious, as a mechanism for producing valid assessments of anything but the simplest of human capabilities.For those prepared to look critically at the evidence there is an irrefutable case for the abolition of current models of assessment and certication in Scotland.Students were demonstrating in Saturday in George Square and Dalkeith to protest about their treatment. They have been failed by the system. They deserve our strongest possible support.Jim Rand, Blanefield.WHATEVER the rights and wrongs of the recent SQA marking furore and the consequences that may fall from it, I think that a degree of naivety and or benign ignorance may be present in the approach and beliefs of some of those seemingly disadvantaged by apparently poorer exam results than expected.Put simply, and using mathematics as an example of a subject discipline whose \"answers\" in a test must surely be as objectively \"correct\" as is possible, it is not the case that a persons test score of, say,  per cent on the day will be the mark grade that ends up as that persons final mark grade. For a iety of reasons, that \"raw\" score is then subject to an equal iety of \"adjustments\" based on all sorts of indicators.The Bell Curve, for example, the rationale of which argues that human intelligence is substantially influenced by both inherited and environmental factors and that, ipso facto, is therefore a better predictor of many outcomes, is a common type of distribution for a iable on which the highest point represents the most probable event in a series of data while all other possible occurrences are systematically distributed around the mean. This has the consequence of forcing groups of people to be categorised as poor, average, good. Also, for smaller groups, having to categorise a set number of iniduals in each category to \"fit\" a Bell curve will do a disservice to those iniduals.Of course, none of the above in any way, diminishes the sense of anger and frustration felt by those most affected. There are many people, too, who hold that such social engineering, for whatever reason, is simply not on. However, the point is that these types of assessments  re-adjustments, and many more, are taken into account when final grades are being awarded.Consequently, those who believe, like the head of Clton Hall school in Edinburgh, that the professional standards of teaching staff are being called into question are aiming at the wrong target. Its not the teacher marking thats in any way imperfect rather its the myriad statistical contortions gone through by those who have rarely seen the inside of a classroom or struggled face-to-face with the learning dficulties of many of our youngsters that are the issue.Finally, as an anecdotal pointer to the iniable cries of marking inconsistencies that arise every year, as a teacher and SQA marker of many years, manys the time when I and other colleagues have smiled wryly at the idea of appealing for some students grades to be downgraded, such is our surprise when they \"over-achieve\".

Nationalists usually argue that Scotland would be better off economically and socially because of independence, but it actually doesnrsquot matter because independence is their top priority. Their thinking is: the economy and equality are important, but not as important as independence.This is the way, to be honest, that a lot of nationalists think, but they usually keep quiet about it because they know left-leaning voters would not be impressed. Lots of voters actually put equality as their top priority rather than the constitution and some of them voted Yes in  because they thought independence would improve equality and some voted No because they worried it would make inequality worse ndash I talked to lots of voters who think along these lines when I was on the ground with the Yes campaign in . Theyrsquore the opposite of nationalists: equality comes first, not independence. For nationalists, itrsquos the other way round.It is this kind of context that makes Mr Smithrsquos email so interesting, and embarrassing. What he said was that changes were needed to the SNPrsquos national executive committee because so much of the partys oxygen was taken up, in his words, by peripheral issues like reform of the law on gender. The BAME, womenrsquos and disabled conveners and others should lose their places on the NEC, he said, and become part of a separate forum instead. ldquoEqualities are close to my heart, said Mr Smith, ldquobut not as close as independence.:Nicola Sturgeon admits party disputes pose risk to SNP successIt is that last phrase thatrsquos the killer and itrsquos a bit unpleasant to see it written down in such stark terms ndash unpleasant but not surprising. In , Nicola Sturgeon wrote a piece for The Sunday Herald in which she said the case for self-government transcended the issues of Brexit, of oil, of national wealth and balance sheets, and of passing political fads and trends. The comment may have been less nakedly honest than Mr Smithrsquos, but it amounts to the same thing: independence matters more than everything , even ndash and this is the extraordinary bit ndash national wealth.But letrsquos not over-egg the comparison between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Smith because therersquos a big dference between them and it demonstrates why the First Minister is doing so well during the pandemic. Scottish independence transcends every other issue for her ndash she said so in The Sunday Herald ndash but as First Minister she also knows that the public health problem has to be the priority. In times of crisis, she said at the start of all this, the issues that ide us seem less important.This approach by the First Minister has not gone down well with some supporters of independence ndash the ones that take the ldquoIndependence First principle literally, or want new pro-Yes parties, or are aching for theof Alex Salmond, like Aslan from Over-The-Sea. We also shouldnrsquot be too lenient on the First Minister ndash pupils and parents caught up in the SQA debacle, for example, might disagree that she has put independence to one side to concentrate on domestic matters.However, for another constituency of voters, Ms Sturgeonrsquos approach is playing very effectively and probably explains why her party, and its cause, is doing well in the polls. Scotlandrsquos first SNP government, from , knew it was more important to look responsible than pick fights with London and it was relaxed about passing motions which allowed Westminster to enact laws on which there was common ground and it played well with voters. The same is happening now: Ms Sturgeon knows itrsquos important to look responsible in a time of crisis and itrsquos playing well with voters.The fact that the First Minister has handled the crisis in this way reflects well on her the way in which shersquos getting it right is also demonstrated by the way in which Alyn Smith got it wrong in his email. Mr Smith said equality was close to his heart but not as close as independence whereas the First Minister has backed off on the pronouncements about independence because she knows it would sound wrong during the coronavirus crisis.All of this has led the First Minister to a pretty clear interpretation of whatrsquos been happening for her party, as well as a strategy for the future. ldquoRight now, she says, ldquothe majority of the people in the country we serve are worried about their health and theyre worried about their ability to pay their bills. Opinion polls would suggest they massively trust the SNP to lead them through that crisis. If they ever thought the SNP was turning away from that priority and focusing on its own agendas and engaging in in-fighting Im sure they would pass a verdict on that.\":Lord McConnell in stark SQA warning to Nicola Sturgeon and John SwinneyI think itrsquos hard to disagree with that analysis, but it creates two problems for Ms Sturgeon. First, there are many in her party who disagree with her and think the focus should always be on the agenda of independence first and the disquiet is likely to get louder the longer the First Minister ldquofocuses on what matters to people rather than independence.However, the second problem is potentially more serious. The dissenters in her party ndash troublesome as they are ndash will ultimately, always, support independence, whereas the voters impressed by the First Ministerrsquos handling of coronavirus may be more fickle. At the height of a crisis, theyrsquove liked the First Ministerrsquos tactics and style, but as coronavirus drops down the agenda and independence s to the top of it, they may not be quite so happy.

And there is no effective treatment or cure, yet.Scots author and wine specialist Davy Zyw was only  years old when he received the ldquole-shattering MND diagnosis which changed his entire le.That was two years ago and he admits that he is on borrowed time.On Wednesday , the newlywed will join with his twin brother Tommy Zyw, director at The Scottish Gallery, to cycle the North Coast  over four days as part of moves to find a cure.Davy and Tommy training in PatagoniaThe arduous -mile scenic route around the north coast of Scotland, starting and ending at Inverness Castle is in aid of My Name Doddie Foundation, the charity set up by Scottish rugby legend Doddie Weir who is currently taking part in a poundm clinical trial which aims to find treatments that can slow, stop or reverse disease progression.It will not just support research into causes and potential cures, it will also provide grants to those who live with it to enable as fulfilled a le as possible.\"I thought I could be on a ventilator two years after my diagnosis, but instead Irsquom preparing for a  mile bike ride, I feel incredibly lucky,\" admitted Davy who was warned by doctors when diagnosed to avoid strenuous activity.\"As we head toward the two-year anniversary since my diagnosis, I want to help drive awareness of this le-shattering disease and do my bit to help find a cure when I still have power in my legs, lead in my pecker and enough grip in my hands to hold my handlebars,\" said the Edinburgh author.\"Itrsquos been a dficult journey to get to today, where I have accepted my lot, and I am ready to share this with you all. Every pound we raise and every pedal we push will go towards finding a cure and raising awareness for people living with the disease. People like me.Davy training in the Cairngorms in JanuaryThe charity ride had been planned for May  but was rescheduled to later this month due to the pandemic.Davy and Tommy will be accompanied by their younger brother Sorley and four friends.There is support from famed Scottish artist Kate Downie who will create a limited-edition work of the Zyw brothers cycling across the Forth Road Bridge to help raise funds.T-shirts designed by London-based artist and interior designer Luke Edward Hall will also be available and The Scottish Gallery will host a series of online events in aid of the event.Davy admits that the challenge in the marathon ride, is whether his body can deal with it.The writer of two non-fiction books about wine and champagne, is already suffering the effects of MND, and admits there is some shaking and wasting of muscles in his left hand and arm and some loss ofin one hand. His left hand is now so weak he cannot squeeze a tube of toothpaste. \"The endgame of MND is being paralyzed, your mind left whole to review the progress of your condition whilst being prisoned in a body which you cannot ,\" said Davy.\"This is a dficult conclusion to face in le for anyone. But there is no point wallowing in self pity as I will miss the best times of my le, and the best of my health. And I like being active.\"It is depressing watching my left arm and hand loose strength, dexterity andbut considering I thought I could be on a ventilator  years after my diagnosis, but instead Irsquom preparing for a  mile bike ride, I feel incredibly lucky.\"Every day is a good day and I fight against the disease at every opportunity. I see my health sliding down an icy incline, so I have to run up the hill to stay in charge. I donrsquot take no for an answer and I live a le without compromise. I rest well, I eat well, I am on a lot of medication which slows the worst of the progression. I drink great wine le is too short.\"\"Irsquom looking forward to seeing the finish line, that is really appealing!\"But really, Irsquom looking forward to the journey itself, being with my brothers and friends on the road as a pack.\"I think anyone taking on  miles over four days would be a bit worried, yoursquod have to be mad not to be. Especially with the inclement weather of Bonnie Scotland. Cold and fatigue make my symptoms worse, so I am nervousI get too exposed.Training in the Highlands\"When I was diagnosed, I was told to avoid strenuous activity and not to put undue pressure on my nervous system which is already under duress. Doctors said I would be lucky to maintain my fitness and health in le, rather than get fitter before the disease really took a hold of me. So when we started training for this challenge, I didnrsquot know how my body was going to react to the amount of strain I would put it through.\"Davy has received a specially signed bike and helmet from cycling legends Mario Cipollini and Alessandro De Marchi in advance of the ride later this month.Their route circumnavigates Scotlandrsquos remote coastline and climbs the total equivalent height of Mount Everest. Navigating from Inverness, through Applecross, Torridon, Ullapool, Durness, Caithness and Dingwall, the physically demanding route is famed for its magnicent views and uncompromising landscape.In preparation, during lockdown the brothers have had to ride indoors on turbo trainers.Between them, the duo have cycled over , miles in preparation and Davy says: \"We are as ready as we will ever be now! Even after my diagnosis, we are still very competitive which fuels us on even harder.\"At the back of my mind there was a fear that I will actually exacerbate my condition by doing this challenge. But I have cycled  miles since then, I feel strong and fitter than I ever have. Although the future of my health is uncertain, my hand is weak, my energy levels low, and sometimes my cramps are so severe I canrsquot use my arms, I feel bloody fantastic. Bring the -mile ride on Irsquom already looking forward to our next big challenge.\"A challenge of the training was being in lockdown, cycling indoors or on the road solo. You need strength in your legs for long distance riding of course, but mental strength and motivation often comes from the people and team you are with. The highlight had to be coming out of lockdown when we could ridebut together on the road.\"This meant lot of racing, chasing and a lot of laughs. Cycling is tough, but it has to be fun. We are so fortunate to have the access to such incredible landscapes and roads from Edinburgh, which we donrsquot take for granted.\"Davy and Tommy Zyw wearing charity T-shirtsThe MND clinical trial launched in January was open to almost every person in Scotland with the degenerative condition which sees muscles waste away after a loss of nerve cells that control movement, speech and breathing.While typical clinical trials focus on a single drug, MND-SMART will allow more than one treatment to be tested at a time, giving patients a higher chance of receiving an active treatment, rather than the placebo.MND Scotland has invested pound. million, half of the charitys annual turnover, to allow the pioneering research it describes as \"ground-breaking\" to take place."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11645145.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scotlands-schools-return-7-key-points-parents-pupils-know","story":"Schools across the country are set to reopen their doors full-time from August , with some local authorities opting for blended method until August .It comes as a recent survey suggests almost half of teachers do not think it is safe for pupils to .The NASUWT union questioned  teachers ahead of schools reopening this week.The survey found teachers are anxious about going back to work and have not been given enough information or time to prepare.A total of % of those questioned do not think it will be safe for pupils to , with % uncertain.But what should parents and pupils know ahead of the t to the classroom Social distancing:There should be no requirement for physical distancing between pupils of any age However where possible, secondary school pupils should physically distance where possible - being asked to refrain from close contact including hugs and high-fives.Pupils should not sit face-to-face at shared desks.Adults teahcers will be expected to stay m from pupils other adults wherever possible.If yoursquore worried about your child going back to the classroom, National Clinical Director @JasonLeitch has explained what schools and nurseries are doing to keep children safe and what you can expect when they get there.Find out more ## https:t.co MurxrqrqI pic sVMvVUFace coverings:PPE will not be needed in most schools, unless required by a risk assessment.Pupils will not be required to wear a face covering, but anyone wishing to do so should be allowed to.Where staff cannot maintain a m distance and are interacting face-to-face for a sustained period of around  minutes or more, a face covering should be worn.A changed day:Some schools and local authorities may opt for staggered start and end times to allow for less crowding as parents drop of and collect their children.

This situation is not the fault of students, so it should not be on students to fix it. Thatrsquos on us.She also said she still had confidence in her education secretary John Swinney, who will now be in charge of fixing the mess.After the SQA botched exam results in , the then Labour education minister was moved to a new job.Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoIn a very dficult and unprecedented situation, we took decisions that we thought on balance were the right ones, and we took them with the very best of intentions.ldquoThese were broadly the same decisions that have been reached for England and Wales as well.ldquoBut our concern, which was to make sure the grades young people got were as valid as those they would have got in any other year, perhaps led us to think too much about the overall system, and not enough about the inidual pupil.ldquoThat has meant that too many students feel that they have lost out on grades that they should have had, and also that that has happened as a result, not of anything theyrsquove done, but because of a statistical model or an algorithm.ldquoAnd in a addition that burden has not fallen equally across our society.ldquoSo despite our best intentions, I do acknowledge that we did not get this right and Irsquom sorry for that.ldquoBut instead of doing what politicians sometimes doo and dig our heels in, we are determined to acknowledge that and put it right.Ms Sturgeon went on: ldquoThere are deeper questions we will need to resolve for the longer term, about the impact of exams on the attainment gap and the dference between exams and teacher judgement.ldquoBut the most immediate challenge is to resolve the grades awarded to pupils this year.ldquoWe will not expect every student who has been downgraded to appeal.ldquoThis situation is not the fault of students, so it should not be on students to fix it.\"Thatrsquos on us. And we will set out tomorrow exactly how we intend to do that.Last year, the national attainment rates at A to C for National , Higher and Advanced Higher were . per cent, .% and .% respectively.But when teachers estimated the grades for their pupils after exams were cancelled because of the lockdown, the rates jumped by .,  and . percentage points respectively.The SQA then looked at past yearrsquos data, including inidual school data, to reduce the pass rates to what it considered more realistic - .%, .% and .% respectively.As the overestimation was greatest in schools in deprived areas, the subsequent reductions were also greatest for those schools, leading to claims poor pupils were being treated unfairly and marked down because of their schoolrsquos track record, not their own efforts.In the question and answer session at the daily briefing, Ms Sturgeon said the governments priority was to \"recty\" the SQA situation, and backed Mr Swinney, despite him approving the SQA approach that has now falllen apart.\"I accept that we did not get this right, therefore the onus will be on the government to fix this.\"She added: \"I dont attach any blame to the SQA for this. This is ministers responsibility.\"She said she understood many pupils would think it \"deepy unfair\" that they were being graded by an algorithm.She said: \"Im not prepared this years cohort of pupils, particurlarly those from the most deprived communities, to think that their hard word does not countthe system is determined to be against them.\"Ms Sturgeon said had done \"a lot of soul-searching and a lot of listening to young people\".Teacher estimates which would have seen a Higher pass rate of % among young people from the most deprived backgrounds, compared to around % last year.Last week, Ms Sturgeon said that% increase in a single year was\"unprecedented and thereforenotcredible\"Asked about this following the announcement of a rethink, she said: \"I didnt say teacher assessments are not credible.\"I said an overall outcome that led to a -point increase in the pass rates -and when I used those numbers last week I was talking about the bottom % in terms of deprivation -that I didnt think that outcome would be seen as credible.\"She added: \"What Im saying now is I think, whatever the view of that is, in my mind now a bigger problem is leaving an impression with young people that it doesnt matter how hard you work at school, some algorithm is going to get in your way.\"Im not prepared to have that, and that is why we will set out the alternative approach...tomorrow.\"Shortly before Ms Sturgeon spoke, Labour published the text of its no confidence motion.It urged MSPs to record their lack of faith in Mr Swinney ldquoin light of his mismanagement of schools education and in particular of this yearrsquos awarding of grades to Scotlandrsquos school pupils and the unfairness of the system applied by the SQA.Scottish Labour education spokesperson Iain Gray said: ldquoJohn Swinney has presided over the greatest scandal in education in Scotland for decades and for five days refused to acknowledge any failure. This is unacceptable.ldquoScottish Labour has today formally submitted a motion of no confidence in John Swinney and is actively seeking the support of parliamentarians.ldquoJohn Swinney has made it clear that he has no confidence in the teachers or pupils of Scotland. It is now Scottish Labourrsquos task to inform the Education Secretary that the people of Scotland have no confidence in him.The Scottish Tories have said they will support the motion, but the Greens, whose votes would be critical to it passing, have stopped short of that in their otherwise stinging criticism.Green MSPRoss Greersaid:ldquoIrsquom pleased that the First Minister has now acknowledged that her government got this wrong and apologised.\"The working class young people who were unfairly treated last week need an urgent solution to this unacceptable situation.\"The Education Secretarys statement to Parliament must announce the kind of systemic solution the Greens have demanded, otherwise our confidence in this governments ability to discharge its responsibilities in education will come into question.\"Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Mr Swinney has  hours to put together a package of measures to fix the SQA exam results scandal.He said:ldquoWe will listen to John Swinneyrsquos proposals in Parliament andwe are not satisfied with what he puts forward, we will vote to remove him.ldquoThe Deputy First Minister cannot casually blame the pandemic for his failures. For months he was warned repeatedly to turn back before it was too late. There was another way and he rejected it.ldquoWe need a solution to this chaos, and we need to hear a compelling case for why John Swinney should be the one to carry this out.ldquoIf the Education Secretary had listened to teachers and experts and acted earlier, thousands of young people would not have been put through a system that denied pupils equal opportunities and reinforced inequalities.\""},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-not-rule-extending-aberdeen-lockdown","story":"The First Minister said more than half of Scotlands latest Covid- cases are in the NHS Grampian health board area.Speaking at the Scottish Governments regular coronavirus briefing, she said there have been  new cases of the virus across Scotland in the past  hours and provisional figures indicate  of these are in Grampian.However, Ms Sturgeon said she is not able to say how many of these cases are linked to the Aberdeen outbreak that led to a local lockdown being introduced.She said there have been  coronavirus cases in Aberdeen since the start of the local outbreak on July .Of these,  were linked to the Covid- cluster and  contacts have been identied.The First Minister praised the work of the contract tracing teams but warned she expects cases and contacts to rise further in the days ahead.She said an extension of the Aberdeen lockdown cannot be ruled out but restrictions will not be kept in place longer than is deemed necessary.She said: \"Having done it, we need to make sure we do it long enough to get the cluster and the outbreak under control and so I cant rule out and wont rule out the possibility that we may have to extend for a further seven days.\"Aberdeens lockdown will be reviewed on Wednesday.Ms Sturgeon added: \"More generally, the events of the past fortnight have been a reminder of how fragile Scotlands overall position is and that is the same in countries across the world.\"The fact is we all still need to be really careful right now and Aberdeen is very hard proof of that fact.\"While our lives have regained a bit of normality in recent weeks, nobodys le should be feeling absolutely normal at the moment.\"Covid is still present and we know it is still highly infectious so all of us have a big role to play in keeping it under control.\"The daily overall new cases figure across Scotland is down  from the  confirmed on Sunday and takes the total people in Scotland who have tested positive for the virus to ,.The First Minister said no deaths have been recorded of patients who tested positive for coronavirus in the previous  days.There have been no deaths under this measure for  consecutive days, with this total remaining at ,.Of the people who tested positive,  are in hospital - up six from the previous day.

The idea of a \"postcode lotteryrsquo is now firmly embedded.Reporters, researchers, politicians, and placards have all repeated ious versions of Ruth Davidsonrsquos claims in the Mail on Sunday that ldquothe most disadvantaged pupils were more than twice as likely to have their grades lowered than wealthier students. It has become such an article of faith for so many that it is incredible to realise that it all stems from a basic statistical misunderstanding of a single set of tables.The only data thus far available to compare estimates and moderated results by relative social deprivation, are  tables in the SQArsquos Equality Impact Assessment. These tables comparethe percentages that would have achieved a C-grade of betterthe estimates had been accepted with the equivalent percentages after moderation was applied.It is true that they show that the percentage achieving Grades A-C was reduced by a greater amount for pupils from areas of higher deprivation. The obvious interpretation is that such pupils must have been more likely to have had estimates downgraded. Simple conclusions from statistics are often misleading.The tables tell us nothing about estimated As or Bs being downgraded to Bs and Cs and so provide no basis to conclude whether any group has been more likely to be downgraded.Intuitively, the most likely phenomenon shown by this data is that the more deprived groups were likely to have included a larger number of estimated borderline passes. If all groups are then treated equally they end up with more such passes downgraded but not because of unequal treatment.For the statistically minded: imagine twp frequency distributions with dferent means and a pass mark to the left of those means. Now move them both left by the same amount. Yoursquoll get tables very similar to those published by the SQA.That of course is no consolation to the pupils who have narrowly missed a C grade, but what about the situation at other grades  Although the SQA has not published such statistics, it is likely that the situation is reversed at Grade A. Intuitively, because of the higher number of A estimates to begin with in less deprived areas. Or, for the maths geeks, repeat the thought experiment but with a higher cut-off point to the right of the mean. It seems very likely that the number of estimated As downgraded will have been higher for more affluent areas ndash this is just the reverse effect of what happens at Grade C.If, as is starting to seem likely, the grades awarded are revised to match the estimates, the most striking feature might be the large number of extra A grades for rich kids. Such are the unintended consequences of basing policy on a simplistic analysis of data.That nobody seems to have noticed this is perhaps the truest indictment of our education system.Andrew Morrison, Dunfermline.IN the past twenty years there has never been a release of school examination results that met with universal acceptance. It will never happen. It cannot happen. Politics demands it so.Previously, any cohort of students in any subject, which had two or three per cent increases yearly, would be criticised as showing subject matter being \"dumbed down\". Conversely,two or three per cent reductions are recorded yearly, then criticism is voiced that exams are being set too dficult. If subject results are static, then the complaint is that progress is not being made.The usual subjects ndash CfE badly designed poorly implemented, teachers pay too low and staff over-stressed, classroom assistants under resourced and the like ndash have all been eclipsed this year by the Covid  pandemic.The option of having no results awarded this year would never have flown.The assessing by teachers resulted in high over-estimates and the SQA algorithm model is the outcome.A wonderful coalition has now come together through Ian Gray, Donald Ross, Willie Rennie and Jamie Green united in favour of taking teachers assessments at face value and removing any SQA equalisation to past pass levels. .Just how does this now work With pass marks this year raised % on last year, come   in months time, are we to see every student in every exam receive a top grade  Why bother with examinations  Alternatively, next year sees a huge fall in pass marks to equalise this years leap The total number of places at Scottish universities and colleges will never equal the number of secondary schools passes. Therefore evenevery student received A graded passes there will still be an entry sting process and disappointment is now moved from the school pass stage to the tertiary selection stage.Every possible solution offered in this matter will fail some faction in society.Robert Wolfenden, Biggar.THE calls for John Swinney to resign are ludicrous. We have to recognise that teacher estimates are far from infallible. I once predicted a D for a pupil and in the exam he scored A ndash although my other predictions were broadly consistent.A moderation process was essential, since the average prediction was  per cent better than typical of former years exam results. To have allowed the predictions to stand unmoderated would have been unfair to pupils of previous years.If ire is to be directed anywhere it should be towards the school, or even the inidual teacher, whose predictions in previous years had been seen to be consistently over-optimistic. With due consideration at appeal, we would hope that cases of genuine underperformence will be recognised and rectied.James McKelvie, Carmunnock.NOW that the SQA has developed a robust algorithm to adjust results down, it can be used regularly in the future to adjust for deprivation by increasing grades. This would have the effect of allowing for inequality, encouraging effort, boosting self-confidence, and achieving the policy goal of reducing the attainment gap. Win, win and unarguable logic given the current detriment logic.Bob MacKinnon, Inverness.IS there room for an alternative view of the importance of examinations and education in these stressful times Writing as someone who left school with a couple of dodgy Highers, I can tell young people who have been disappointed in their results that this is not the end of the world or even the road, its only the beginning. Having sought employment in an occupation which genuinely excited me, I was interviewed by some \"suits\" in London. The interview ended in a bit of a barney between one of the interviewers and my rather bolshie self about politics . I left the interview room thinking \"Oh well, Ill just have to think of something .\"I was rather surprised therefore to be accepted on to a training course against some quite stf competition, and which led to a long and interesting career. It turned out that they were looking for bolshie young people who would stand up for themselves.However, that was only the beginning of my education. I eventually graduated with honours in History with Frenchfrom the Open University, at the age of . As most people of my age will tell you, education is a le-long experience, both for good and ill. I spend more time reading and learning now than I ever have before.My message to young folk at thiscrucial time in their lives is: believe in yourself stand up for yourself argue your point with anyone who will engage and just make friends with those who wont above all keep learning from every experience you encounter and dont worryyou fail from time to time.John Jamieson, Ayr.WHILE I agree that the disruption to young peoples education has a massive effect, I would say that a positive outlook has to be kept. I did not have the opportunity to go to university, but I have always read widely, and I educated myself. In agreement with Mark Twain, I did not let my schooling interfere with my education.Margaret Forbes, Kilmacolm.Read more: Letters: Lets end the school examination and certication process"},{"url":null,"title":"douglas-ross-refuses-deny-plotting-previous-scottish-tory-leader","story":"The Moray MP, who replaced Mr Carlaw unopposed last week, was pressed about his role in an alleged plot on BBC Radio Scotland.It emerged last week that the former Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson had visited Mr Ross in his rural home four days before Mr Carlaw quit on July .Boris Johnson and cabinet office minister Michael Gove also met Mr Ross just before Mr Carlaw said he had reached the painful conclusion that someone  should lead his party into the  election.The Eastwood MSP had been in the job less than six months, and party sources have claimed he was pushed out afterfailing to make an impression with voters or make headway against the SNP, which is now riding higher in the polls.Ms Davidson backed Mr Ross for the leadership within minutes of Mr Carlawrsquos resignation statement being published in a lsquojoint ticketrsquo arrangement until the election.Until Mr Ross, an MSP for a year before moving to Westminster in , s to Holyrood next year, she will face Nicola Sturgeon at First Ministers Questions.Mr Ross last week refused to say what he had talked to Ms Davidson about when she visited him, insisting it was a ldquoprivate meeting.It later emerged that, according to its electronic time-stamp, the logo on Mr Rossrsquos leadership website was created before Mr Carlaw announced he had quit.On BBC Radio ScotlandsDrivetime, host John Beattie repeatedly pushed Mr Ross about Mr Carlawrsquos departure and his role in a potential plot to oust him.Mr Ross said: ldquoItrsquos a private meeting, John, andyou and I were ever to have a private meeting it would stay that way, you can be assured of that.ldquoAs you know full well, from Jackson Carlawrsquos own resignation statement, a very brave statement from someone who reflected over the summer himself that he was not the right person to take the party forward, I think Jackson made that very clear in his own statement.Askedhe had known on July , the date of his meeting with Ms Davidson, that Mr Carlaw was leaving, Mr Ross said: ldquoNo.Askedhe had been \"plotting the overthrow\" of Mr Carlaw, he said: ldquoJohn, John, Irsquove said it was a private meeting, and thatrsquos what I respect, privacy.Asked why he didnrsquot simply deny plotting against Mr Carlaw, Mr Ross said: ldquoAnd then yoursquod ask me a series of other questions, which I donrsquot think is right.Pressed again why he didnrsquot just deny plotting to remove Mr Carlaw, Mr Ross said: ldquoIrsquom quite sure, John, you get my point.

The council is also looking at ways to fill gaps in childcare provision for children under two and after school care for older children.The move is in tandem with schools and marks a signicant milestone in the Government’s “route map” out of lockdown as Scotland continues to make good progress in suppressing COVID-.OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing James Wylie said the focus is very much “getting it right for every child” in ing to these services after a challenging period of many months.“The decision to close Early Learning and Childcaresettings has had an impact on the lives of children and families throughout Orkney,# Mr Wylie explained.#There was little time to prepare, or scope to explain, the changes to our youngest children. Their relationships and friendships were abruptly interrupted as well as their learning.“Our focus must be on supporting children when they are in settings, to form a secure and emotionally resilient attachment base which will stand them in good stead as they grow and develop.  Nurturing and attached relationships are essential to creating the conditions for children to flourish in early learning and childcare.“All children have a right to play, to learn and to access experiences that meet their physical, social, emotional and cultural needs, and they have a right to associate with their peers. The health and wellbeing of children and adults is vital and these important rights and considerations have all been factored into the development of a framework for reopening and delivering ELC services.“We now know that young children are less likely to be affected by or transmit the virus. This means we are able to reduce some of the restrictions on ELC delivery laid out in previous guidance. However, we cannot yetto normal ELC practice – we all need to ensure that we continue to manage services and mitigate risks.”Mr Wylie pointed out that every child will have dferent levels of required support. He explained that some children have additional support needs and it will be important as part of the risk assessments carried out to consider the inidual needs of a child. Where there is a need to work in close proximity with adults and children the appropriate safety measures should be put in place based on that risk assessment.There will be a short transitional period for introducing our youngest children back into their learning and childcare services this week and this will y within each setting. The aim is to have all children, where possible, back into their settings by August .In line with government advice, there will be no requirement for physical distancing between children in nurseries. In nurseries two metre distancing will not apply between adults and children as, this does not meet young children’s social and emotional needs. However, adults will need to stay two metres apart wherever possible.Similarly, no PPE is required when undertaking routine educational activities. However, staff will continue to follow existing guidance on PPEit is required. Enhanced hygiene measures will be undertaken where necessary.Anyone showing symptoms of COVID- should not attend the childcare setting.A list of FAQs has been compiled to assist all as settings reopen their doors — they can be found here www.orkney.gov.uk CV-EL-FAQcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

To be counted among the unemployed, workers need to be actively looking for a new job, which many have decided not to do yet, the ONS said.However, this does not mean that the people in question do not want a job, said Jonathan Athow, the ONSrsquos deputy national statistician for economic statistics. vw,vw,px, px\"ldquoFigures from our main survey show there has been a rise in people without a job and not looking for one, though wanting to work, he said.ldquoIn addition, there are still a large number of people who say they are working no hours and getting zero pay.Between May and June employment dropped by the largest amount in a quarter since .The over-s, the self-employed and part-time workers were especially badly hit.Meanwhile, the number of hours worked by British employees has dropped to record lows.The ONS said that around . million people were estimated to be temporarily away from work in June this year, most of them on the Governmentrsquos furlough scheme.Around three million of these had been away for three months or more. vw,vw,px, px\"And around , people in the UK were away from work because of the pandemic but getting no pay last month, the statisticians revealed.The number of people claiming benefits because they are unemployed or underemployed jumped to . million, a nearly % increase since March.The number of vacancies jumped % in May to July at , from a record low in April to June.Total nominal pay dropped .% on the year and regular nominal pay fell for the first time since records began in .Mr Athow added: ldquoThe labour market continues recent trends, with a fall in employment and signicantly reduced hours of work as many people are furloughed.ldquoThe falls in employment are greatest among the youngest and oldest workers, along with those in lower-skilled jobs.ldquoVacancies numbers began to recover in July, especially in small businesses and sectors such as hospitality, but demand for workers remains depressed.The worst of the job losses came in the beginning of the lockdown months. Many people were taken off payrolls as large parts of the economy ground to a halt in late March when Prime Minister Boris Johnson told everyone to only leave their homes to exercise or get food.Between March and June UK workers on company payrolls dropped by ,, according to ONS data released last month. Most of that was weighted towards the early days of lockdown.Experts are worried that the full extent of Britainrsquos jobs problems has been hidden by the Governmentrsquos furlough scheme, which promised to cover % of the salaries of staff who could not work because of lockdown.These furloughed workers are still considered to be employed, but many worry they will have no job to come back to when the scheme winds down.The furlough scheme ends in October, though the Government has promised a pound, per employee bonus to any company that brings back furloughed staff and keeps paying them until January.ldquoWhile the headline data continues to lag behind the reality on the ground, the decline in the number of employees on payrolls and hours worked is further evidence of the damage being done to the UK labour market by the coronavirus pandemic, said Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce.ldquoThe furlough scheme has been successful in preserving millions of jobs.ldquoHowever, with firms continuing to face a perfect storm of increased costs, reduced demand, and diminished cash reserves, unemployment is likely to surge as the Government support schemes wind down, unless action is taken.Chancellor Rishi Sunak, said: ldquoTodayrsquos labour market stats make it clear that our unprecedented support measures, including the furlough and self-employed support schemes, are working to safeguard millions of jobs and livelihoods that could otherwise have been lost.copy -.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges.

He valued the comradeship and the friends he made during times of hardship far away from home. “I suppose that’s why he took so much interest in the Burma Star Association in later years. He could talk with people who’d been out in the South East Asia theatre and who had experienced similar things.”When Tom was quizzed by his prooud daughter about his role in the war he often preferred to joke about his experiences.“I asked my dad how many planes he had shot down but I remember him saying the closest he got to flying, was laying in bottom of flat bellied boat going into Hong Kong harbour! “Lots of servicemen ended up with bad illnesses out in the Far East and Dad was no exception.“I remember him telling me how he suddenly took sick in the street. He had to throw up and it was then that his  teeth came out and fell into the stream of filthy water which was running down the alley.“He had to chase after them and give them a rinse off - he was never going to get replacments in India during the war!” But it was in the immediate aftermath of the conflict that Tom became one of a very small number of British servicemen to be posted to the Japanese mainland to help with the clean-up of the devastated cities.With the prospect of terrible losses in any military invasion of Japan, the decision had been taken to unleash the Atomic Bombs in a bid to force the Japanese into surrender. The United States detonated two nuclear weapons over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August  and , , respectively, with the consent of the United Kingdom. The two bombings killed between , and , people and remain the only uses of nuclear weapons in armed conflict.Tom received a medal for working in the zones but rarely talked about the more distressing experiences. “He would just say that the whole city had been wiped out. He - and no-one  - had ever seen anthing like it,” says Sandra. “You can only imagine the kind of things he saw.”In later years, Sandra remembers her father’s breathing problems.“My dad was a chronic asthmatic and I remember, after he died, a woman came to see me. They were trying to seethere was any link about ex-servicemen with chest problems and whether it was related to working in areas,that were contaminated after the bomb.“My dad had his normal medals then years later he got the Southeast Asia Medal and I believe he was was the only member in Ireland to hold it“As a wee girl about , I can remember people in the house, were discussing what they would like to inherit.“I wanted my dad’s medals. He was very proud of me taking an interest so he made it his job looking to see any medals he should have had. So he always used to phone me saying I’ve got you another medal - he actually got another  medals,which were commemorative only.”Sandra looked set to follow in her father’s footsteps but her initial attempt ended in failure!“ I asked at  for my dad to sign my papers to join WRAF, but he refused, only for me to join QARANC  years later.” Sandra’s memories of her father also revolve around musicianship.“I asked him one day what would you like to be remembered for and he said his love of music. “He played the trumpet all his le and was in the Silver Band with his brothers Joe and James and their cousins the Woodcocks.“He had a little dance band in the early s ,I remember them playing in the green hut down Harryville Park.”Footnote: Japan surrendered to the Allies on August , six days after the Soviet Unions declaration of war and the bombing of Nagasaki. The Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on September  in Tokyo Bay, which effectively ended World War II.

It would be a stretch to say all of the administrative staff, all of the lecturers and all of the ious other employees are actively fighting against unionism, he wrote on Challenges NI, an online  for young voices in Northern Ireland.However, when unionists state that Queen#s University is a cold house for them, we are trying to discuss the Students# Union, its leadership and the general attitude of certain students around campus. These issues haven#t been addressed.I have sat on the Students# Council and I am constantly left in a state of bemusement at the attitudes. Mr Bell noted how the current Students# Union President, Grian Ni Dhaimhin, had posted on social media in the past expressing her apparent support for militant republicanism.He also claimed two other full-time officers of the Students# Union executive regularly show support for socialist republican activist group #Lasair Dhearg# via social media.Irish nationalist student councillors consistently put forward motions which are nothing but an insult to the unionist community on campus, he said.The latest example being a motion which attempts to ban the British military and PSNI from appearing on campus, a blatant insult to any student, regardless of political views, who intends to join the armed services or police upon graduating.There are #student bars# where unionists, and in particular Protestants, refuse to enter as they have a genuine fear of being the victim of sectarian abuse.In June members of Lasair Dhearg #renamed# Queen#s as #Mairead Farrell University Belfast# in a stunt to remember a former student who was shot dead in Gibraltar in  while engaged in IRA activity. Two other incidents that Queen#s Ogra Sinn Fein were engaged in have gone unpunished by the Students# Union, he added. During Freshers Fair , the Ogra Sinn Fein stand displayed a #Brits Out# sign. And Sinn Fein posters are consistently displayed on lampposts. Strictly speaking, these posters shouldn#t be erected outside election time and constitute littering because they do not have planning permission. These posters represent an attempt to mark territory.There are fewer ways to create a more unwelcoming atmosphere for unionists.Queen#s University as an institution might not be a cold house for unionism now but the Students# Union and attitudes on campus are certainly sending us head-on into an ice age.Queen#s University has been contacted for comment.

When someone dials  their call is initially answered by the Public Emergency Call Service operated by BT. The operator then attempts to connect the call to the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service#sEmergency Ambulance Control.However, in some circumstances calls are routed to the Scottish Ambulance Service as part of a #buddy# arrangement.These include where calls to the emergency control room exceeds its normal call handling capacity, or where an unplanned disruption to  call handling services occurs, through technical or other failures. NIAS said the #buddy# arrangement ensures an appropriate route for  calls to be redirected.It said arrangements in place as standard across all UK ambulance services to ensure business continuityHowever, the number of calls being answered in Scotland has risen sharply.In the last five months of ,  calls were sent to Scottish operators.But by  this had risen to , rising further to  last year. Last September alone  calls were answered in Scotland.The figures were released to this newspaper after a Freedom of Information request.Mr Givan, who has raised the issue with Health Minister Robin Swann, said the reasons for so many calls being sent outside Northern Ireland must be identied.He said: These findings suggest a deeply worrying trend in the number of emergency calls from members of the public in need of medical assistance in Northern Ireland being rerouted to the Scottish Ambulance Service. In ,  such cases took place compared to  the previous year, and only  in the last six months of . This demonstrates a stark and steady increase in contact lost between households and iniduals in need of help locally and NIAS Emergency Ambulance Control. Rerouting these calls naturally increases the risk of delay and disruption in coordination of services.Whilst we recognise the need for effective #buddy# arrangements with services where in the UK to ensure interrupted service in unforeseen situations, this should not be normal course day and daily. Reports of technical faults leading to calls being answered in Scotland extend as far back as  and the root causes need to be identied and rectied.In recent weeks concerns have been raised over ambulance cover in the Newry, south Down and south Armagh regions.The Ambulance Service estimates it needs  additional staff to meet targets.Mr Givan added: It is also vital that an evidence-based approach is adopted to staffing in the NIAS and ambulance control in particular in order to ensure appropriate capacity to meet service demand across Northern Ireland. Covid- has already placed our dedicated ambulance crews and staff under additional operational pressure and they deserve to have every resource available to ensure they can carry out their roles in the most effective way.It is imperative that the Minister of Health moves to address these concerns as a matter of urgency.NIAS said: All UK services have buddying arrangements in place with neighbouring ambulances services. This is considered best practice.NIAS has a #buddy system# with the Scottish Ambulance Service. This ensures continuity of service in the event of #call surges# or interruption to the telephony network. This is a reciprocal arrangement and NIAS will take calls for Scotland.When this happens the Scottish Ambulance Service takes the call and it is passed to NIAS#s command and control system via an electronic gateway for an ambulance to be despatched.

However, it#s still very early days.Exemptions to the new regulations do exist -for staff, children under  and anyone with an illness or impairment.And, bizarrely, you don#t have to wear one in a bank, gym, solicitor#s office or cinema.The Department of Health said it would be an offence to ignore the regulations without a reasonable excuse, adding that the fine may be a fixed penalty notice of £, reduced to £paid within  days.

Retail NI, meanwhile, has insisted it is not for shop owners or staff to enforce the rules.Professor Heneghan, who is director of the University of Oxford#s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, said the implementation of the new regulations has been a triumph of opinion and policy over evidence - one made on observational data, and not on randomised, controlled trials.The Department of Healthhas insisted, however, that it considered a wide range of evidence in making its recommendation for masks to be made mandatory, including two Royal Society reports.Read More Medic behind BBC coronavirus #conspiracy# complaint says: we must stay vigilant Professor Heneghan said: Northern Ireland should be honest with the population when it deems to put a whole policy together and say that we#re going to do this, and be clear: there is very poor quality evidence to inform what we#re going to do next, but we#re going to do it anyhow.The GP insisted the policy has been driven on the basis of decision-makers selecting evidence to suit their opinions.There#s a long history of people trying to use observational study to confer treatment effects. And that#s what people have done, he said.But there#s a real problem with when you do that approach, because you can cherry pick the evidence to suit your argument.So for instance, people use observational data that in countries with masks, infection rates are low. However, when you come to higher quality evidence, randomised, control trials, you see that#s not the case.The question is:you keep introducing interventions like this, people are not questioning do they work, and not questioning how will we evaluatethey work.This is a triumph of opinion and policy over evidence. And the biggest factor is, how can you inform the public of the benefits and the harms of these interventions Read More Suppliers hit hard by pause in Northern Ireland gigs sector Professor Heneghan said not enough focus has been given to the potential counterbalance - or equipoise - to public health intervention policies such as masks.He said: The other thing people don#t understand is that interventions are likely to increase benefit as well as increase harms. People seem to perceive there are no harms with any interventions, which is wrong.It is not clear to me that cloth masks are beneficial or harmful, but it is clear that we don#t use them in healthcare settings because they have been shown to increase the rates of infection compared to surgical masks. By all means wear a mask, butyou#re imposing it on society, then politicians should really ask questions.It#s unacceptable for people to say: #Here#s a review on poor quality evidence that we#re going to use to confer a policy#.Addressing how it is presented to the public, the Oxford expert added: Anything that has #might#, #could# or #may# shows you that you have a problem.If people want to wear masks, then that#s completely up to them. My job is to reduce the uncertainty about whether it#s beneficial or harmful. If you wear it, unfortunately there#s no evidence that I can help you with that#s going to benefit you with high quality studies.In mid-July, Prof Heneghan spotted major discrepancies in how Public Health England recorded coronavirus deaths that led Health Secretary Matt Hancock to order an urgent review.A health spokesperson said: The department has considered a wide range of scientic evidence from a number of sources when developing recommendations around the use of face coverings and new evidence emerges all the time.Questions have also been raised about the huge disparity in cross-border penalties.The £ fine here is far below the Republic, where anyone caught flouting the rule can face a fine of up €, or up to six months# imprisonment.

People will have loved ones that have been sick or passed away, so for them to hear it dismissed on the evening news like that isn#t nice for them to hear.So it was insensitive but the important thing is that they acknowledged the error.As with all healthcare workers in Northern Ireland, working to protect vulnerable patients from the pandemic has become part of Dr O#Neill#s daily le in recent months.I work in acute medicine so would often be the first port of call after people are admitted from AE, he said.I#m also in rheumatology so I have had issues there as lots of patients will be on steroids and immunosuppressive medication.They will have had a tricky time over the last few months with shielding. So it#s fair to say I#ve been thinkinga lot in the last few months.He said yesterday was a big day with face coverings becoming mandatory in shops so it will be interesting to see how well people adapt to that.A BBC spokesperson said last week: The inclusion of this clip was an error of judgment and it was removed from later bulletins and from the BBC Newsline Facebook page.The BBC is a  for engagement and debate, but ideas which fall outside the scientic mainstream should be scrutinised and challenged, which did not happen in this instance.In recent weeks a number of high profile figures, including Formula  champion Lewis Hamilton, have been criticised for appearing to support Covid- conspiracy theories.Mr Hamilton backtracked after sharing a post on Instagram about Bill Gates, with the post suggesting the billionaire lied about vaccine safety or claims vaccines would be used to microchip people. The sports star has since apologised and said that he hadn#t read the post properly, and was not against the use of any potential vaccine.

John could be compared with the greats of Irish Nationalism like O’Connell and Parnell, but the truth of the matter is that John was in a league of his own. googletag.cmd.push  As part of the post-conflict generation, we have John to thank for ensuring that we were able to grow up in a society without violence in our streets, we have John to thank for the fact we can walk any street in Derry with no fear, we have John to thank for guaranteeing that peace would prevail and that the gun would no longer have a place in Irish politics. I find it hard to imagine how Ireland would look today without the influence of John Hume. John’s gt to people all across Ireland and people my age was ironic for such a beloved peacemaker, he taught us how to fight. He taught us how to fight against injustice, how to fight for equality, he taught us how to fight for freedom, how to fight for love, peace and how to fight for a better Ireland which we all can share. He fought with non-violence, he was a pacist, even when confronted with threats, bombs, bullets, and death all around, his morals never shted an inch. John taught us that living for your moral convictions was more righteous than using violent means to achieve your aims. googletag.cmd.push John Hume serves as an example to our post-conflict generation of what we can achieve when we put aside what ides us and instead celebrate what makes us equal. To young people he has shown that we can, in his words, “see an Ireland of partnership where we wage war on want and poverty, where we reach out to the marginalised and dispossessed, where we build together a future that can be as great as our dreams allow.” John’s influence is everywhere throughout the great nation he called home, whether it was through his work in founding the Credit Union movement in Derry and becoming the youngest ever President of the Irish League of Credit Unions, as chair of the University for Derry Committee, his involvement as a civil rights movement leader, his work with the Derry Citizens’ Action Committee, the founding of the SDLP, his positions as MP, MEP and MLA, his role in the ceasefire talks, his work in America or his participation in delivering the Sunningdale Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement or the Good Friday Agreement, John Hume’s le’s work is an indelible inspiration to everyone who calls Ireland home. For me, personally, John Hume is an inspiration, he was a true political titan. I have been asked a number of times since John’s passing why I think everyday people are taking John’s death so personally, here’s why, I feel that John is inextricably linked to everyone in the North, his successes guaranteed that our lives and the lives of our children and grandchildren could be brighter. I think one of the most important lessons we must remember is that John Hume’s work is not finished. We still have to dismantle sectarianism within our society, we still have to work with all shades of the political spectrum, regardless of how much we disagree, in the pursuit of what is best for the people of Ireland. We still must protect civil rights and peace all across the globe from being corroded. We must work together to make a New Ireland and a Shared Ireland, where all people are equal. That is the Ireland John lived for and we must live for too, not only Derry but all of Ireland Mourns John Hume. Go raibh maith agat John, you were truly Ireland’s Greatest.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The facility would link up with the new Magee medical school to train future doctors. The Derry News has learned that plans for a ‘capital build’ project at the Derry hospital are at an ‘early stage’ but have been costed. The development comes shortly after the news emerged on Friday that Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical Schoolis now recruiting students for September  intake. The Western Trust has and will be the main partner to the medical school. Professor Louise Dubras, who will lead the course, appeared at a Western Trust board meeting to update members on the GEMS on August . googletag.cmd.push Speaking at the meeting, Mr Alan Moore, Director of Strategic Capital Development, offered a ‘hearty congratulations’ to Prof. Dubras. He made reference to on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin Hospital which were included in the business case. In response, Prof. Dubras said: “We costed in to our business case the requirement for a capital build at Altnagelvin Hospital to determine the amount of money that would be required for that. “What our expectation is, is that we wish to work with the Trust and Queen’s University Belfastto have a building which serves everybody and I think it’s really important that this is not two universities, two buildings and duplication of everything. googletag.cmd.push “We’re not big enough to do that and it doesn’t provide good education, the only way that this will work well as we move forward is to have a provision which covers all undergraduate education and that enables post-grad activity to take place there. “That’s really important for students to see and work with foundation year doctors and doctors at other stages of their training so that what you have as a Trust is a culture of education and growing educational excellence in the area – and a single place, which is the hub, is where it needs to happen.” TENACITY Addressing the meeting on behalf of the Trust, Dr Catherine McDonnell expressed her admiration for Prof. Dubras’ ‘patience and tenacity’ over the past two years for ‘sticking with the project’ to deliver a medical school in the North West. She said it is ‘extremely important’ to the hospital in terms of stabilising the medical workforce and creating local jobs. To clear up some ‘confusion’ there may be about the nature of the medical school Prof. Dubras pointed out that it’s not a post-graduate medical school for people who are qualied as doctors and doing a master’s degree. She explained that this school will accept students who will be trained as doctors and their degree could have been in any subject as long as they achieved a :. It will be situated within the faculty of Le and Health Sciences. “The medical school is about supporting local young people and improving the economic potential of the region and tackling long-term social deprivation.” Work is ongoing to refurbish buildings at the Magee campus in readiness for students next year. Prof. Dubras said staff recruitment is an interesting area and people have already expressed an interest in coming to Derry to work. Chairman of the Western Trust board, Sam Pollock, said he believes the medical school will help attract staff to address the ongoing issue of agency costs. Director of Performance and Service Improvement, Mrs Teresa Molloy, said there has been extensive interest from partner organisations such as Fermanagh and Omagh Council about the long-term benefits it could bring. EARLY STAGE In , the Department of Health commissioned a Review of Medical School Places which recommended that Northern Ireland needs  more medical students a year to meet the increasing demand for doctors. At last weeks meeting Prof. Dubras pointed out how the medical school with start off with  students and discussions are continuing with The Executive Office to increase that to . Currently, approximately % of medical graduates in Northern Ireland tend to stay and live within  miles of Queen’s University Belfast after graduation, according to the GMC. The new School of Medicine at Magee will address departmental recommendations by providing access to medical education in the North West, positioning theDerryCity region as an attractive place to study and work. Students will benefit from access to clinical placements across the full range of general practice, medical and surgical specialities with primary care-based experience from week one. This will enable students to develop knowledge and appreciation of the interconnectivity between primary, secondary, social and community-based healthcare. A spokesperson for Ulster University confirmed: “Ulster University continues to engage with local partners including the Western Health and Social Care Trust on medical education. “Discussions around joint additional training sites are at a very early stage and no plans have yet been agreed.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The new centre will be moved a short distance to Anderson House at Altnagelvin. Derry was the first city to set-up a COVID centre back on March  at the out-of-hours Western Urgent Care building. The other Covid centre in the Western Trust area opened at South West Acute Hospital on March . The Trust continues to maintain a state of readiness for admissions of patients with suspected Covid- and a further surge. Speaking at the Western Trust’s monthly board meeting, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Chief Executive, said: “Both centres continue to operate, preparing for a potential second surge. googletag.cmd.push “The Altnagelvin centre will move to Anderson and South West centre will reduce its footprint to free up space in the outpatient department. “Movements are allowing us to recommence our outpatient services.” Antibody testing has been offered in the Trust area as of July , she told the Western Trust board. These tests are used to detect antibodies to the COVID- virus to seeyou have previously had the virus. The test works by taking a blood sample and testing for the presence of antibodies to seeyou have developed an immune response to the virus. A total of  tests were carried out and only  ed as positive, which Dr Kilgallen described as an ‘interesting find’. googletag.cmd.push A Covid swab testing service available to staff, patients pre-operatively and staff in the independent sector continues to operate at C-TRIC at Altnagelvin Hospital and Lackaboy in Enniskillen. However, those services are also relocating in August as part of reset plans. The latest NISRA statistics show that  people have died of Covid- in Derry City and Strabane. In the council area there have been  confirmed coronavirus cases –  in the last  days. In response to the Coronavirus pandemic a network of new Primary CareCovid- centres were then rapidly established to manage the growth of Coronavirus cases in the community. They were seen as an essential part of the fight against this virus.  To ensure vital GP services can be maintained, it is believed to be absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with nonCovid- related conditions.  These centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of havingCovid- and require medical attention.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The new centre will be moved a short distance to Anderson House at Altnagelvin. Derry was the first city to set-up a COVID centre back on March  at the out-of-hours Western Urgent Care building. The other Covid centre in the Western Trust area opened at South West Acute Hospital on March . The Trust continues to maintain a state of readiness for admissions of patients with suspected Covid- and a further surge. Speaking at the Western Trust’s monthly board meeting, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Chief Executive, said: “Both centres continue to operate, preparing for a potential second surge. googletag.cmd.push “The Altnagelvin centre will move to Anderson and South West centre will reduce its footprint to free up space in the outpatient department. “Movements are allowing us to recommence our outpatient services.” Antibody testing has been offered in the Trust area as of July , she told the Western Trust board. These tests are used to detect antibodies to the COVID- virus to seeyou have previously had the virus. The test works by taking a blood sample and testing for the presence of antibodies to seeyou have developed an immune response to the virus. A total of  tests were carried out and only  ed as positive, which Dr Kilgallen described as an ‘interesting find’. googletag.cmd.push A Covid swab testing service available to staff, patients pre-operatively and staff in the independent sector continues to operate at C-TRIC at Altnagelvin Hospital and Lackaboy in Enniskillen. However, those services are also relocating in August as part of reset plans. The latest NISRA statistics show that  people have died of Covid- in Derry City and Strabane. In the council area there have been  confirmed coronavirus cases –  in the last  days. In response to the Coronavirus pandemic a network of new Primary CareCovid- centres were then rapidly established to manage the growth of Coronavirus cases in the community. They were seen as an essential part of the fight against this virus.  To ensure vital GP services can be maintained, it is believed to be absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with nonCovid- related conditions.  These centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of havingCovid- and require medical attention.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The start of the summer. A time of hope. A time of new beginnings. To celebrate my th birthday, my friends and I had travelled to Belfast on a minibus on a school-night in the middle of A Levels for that momentous YES concert. We were thrilled to get to see Ash and Bono at the Waterfront. We were extra ebullient at the sight of John Hume taking to the stage. The unlikely trio of David Trimble, John and Bono were applauded with yells of “Yesss!”. googletag.cmd.push  The burning pride deep inside on that night could have set the world alight. To the friends I had yet to meet, some of whom were at that concert, I would always be Proud Mary from Derry. I had come of age just in time to vote in the referendum three days later. Not all of us would have that privilege. My sister, Deirdre, who was singing and shouting her heart out for the entire excursion, was  months shy of voting age. In fact she would never get to vote as she was killed in a car accident we were involved in  months later. googletag.cmd.push I had meticulously studied the Good Friday Agreement text during the referendum campaign. As excited as I was to be on my way to Loch an Iuacuteir for Cuacutersa na Casca that Good Friday, my inner political nerd was sorry to be missing all the TV and radio coverage. No mobile phones or social media in those days. Just two days before the signing of the Agreement, I was at Stormont with a delegation of Derry Girls lobbying the British Government for a new school. I was on The Thornhill Talks Team with Mrs Boyle, Miss Hamilton and Head Girl, and my lelong friend, Emmylou. The eyes of the world were on these negotiations and the hand of history was on our shoulders. John Hume took time out to facilitate the meeting withMinister of Education, Tony Worthington MP. John was the architect of the unfolding momentous peace accord, but he was focussed on bread and butter constituency issues. He knew the importance of education in creating opportunities and building inclusive and peaceful communities. I was engaged in current affairs and local politics from a young age. I was fascinated by the work of my godfather, Uncle Mark. His job as John Hume’s parliamentary aide brought him to ious countries. He gted me with great stories and good lessons over the years. I proudly flaunted a “Hume for Europe” Tshirt in . I read newspapers. I listened intently to the kitchen wireless and followed the TV debates. Always rooting for John and rehearsing the Humespeak: You can’t eat a flag. Spill sweat, not blood. Respect ersity. An accident of birth. Dference is the essence of humanity. This language is now common parlance. John brought others on to his page and round to his way of thinking and speaking. It is impossible to consider John’s achievements without recognising the influence of his we and key adviser, Pat. On completion of my A Levels, I had the pleasure of working in the Bayview Terrace constituency office in the run up to the first Assembly elections. I learned so much about public service, not least in witnessing the compassion and care shown by Pat to every person. The office was buzzing. Phone calls were coming in from journalists, humanitarians and politicians from all over the world. I could hear John speaking in French on the phone one minute, then dealing with a constituent on a housing issue the next minute. Pat had time and warmth for everyone. Amidst the flurry, Pat still found time for banter and indulged my frivolous chats about nights out. I still regard Pat as a mentor and hero. I can only try and imagine the extent of sacrices made by Pat and her family over the years. After that short stint in the office, I spent three months working in Seagate , before starting my chapter at Queen’s and all the adventures that came with that and after that. The Omagh atrocity that summer was a stark reminder of the fragility of the hard-earned peace. John Hume was a political giant, a living legend and an international statesman. Above all, he was a Derry champion. He was a man of global thinking and local action. First-hand experience of poverty in his community motivated his relentless quest for social justice, and his role in founding the credit union movement was instrumental in giving opportunities to people and families. His civic leadership in the community was as impressive as his political leadership on the world stage. John Hume was a man of vision. Steadfast in his ambitions. Resolute in pursuit of solution. Willing to work with anyone. Determined not to be distracted by the viliers. He kept his shoulder to the wheel and his eyes on the prize. Not any of the acclaimed world prizes he won . Ultimately the prize for John was the prize for everyone: peace and the prospect of a brighter future. Those coming of age today face immense challenges as we emerge from a global health pandemic and enter a world recession. Climate emergency is real. In this part of the world we face the added challenges of Brexit uncertainty. Today’s generation need an injection of the hope that my generation were given  years ago. We still have much work to do. The “isolation of the West” remains a pertinent issue. The fight for a proper university presence in the city continues. “I sometimes wish it was that summer again…..” We should always maintain a little bit of that summer, even in the middle of the longest winters. The spirit of partnership and reconciliation underpinning the Good Friday Agreement and defining Hume’s pathway must be restored. And we shall overcome.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club have never tasted adult championship success. With the manner of victory over Glenullin on Sunday afternoon, it would suggest that consistency will be what Eamon Gibson will be looking from his squad during this condensed season. It leaves John Heaneys side with some soul-searching ahead of their clash with Limavady this weekend. From the way Ben McCarron careered through the Glenullin defence in the opening seconds, until the final whistle, they never looked like being reeled in. If anything, they shouldve won by more. If they are to stand up and be counted when the serious heat comes on, they will need a more ruthless streak in front of goal. The pleasing thing for them, they appear to have the raw materials. googletag.cmd.push They will have to take somewhat of a reality check. Glenullin didnt offer the threat many expected and showed signs of the form that found them in relegation trouble last year. It was a big ask for Michael Oacuteg McKeown in his first game in goals to replace the injured Pearse McNicholl and when they failed to secure possession at midfield, it was a long hour for him. Steelstowns runners through the middle hurt them and with Ben McCarron playing as a third midfielder, their mobile attack thrived in the space. Dermot OKane, one the best dead ball kickers in the county, was off colour and Eoin Bradleys relaxed  metre free coming off the post summed up a day they will want to forget. googletag.cmd.push Stephen Cleary played in the reserve game, but was forced off injured and  minutes into the senior game Eoghan Bradleys ankle injury saw him replaced. On came Rory Maguire who had while he had a terric game, he will be disappointed not to have bagged three further goals. Cahir McMonagle will be another option in attack, but its hard to imagine him getting the room he was afforded yesterday when the real action comes to town. Glenullin put Conor Rafferty onto Neil Forester in what seemed like a curtaining job, while Feargal Close pushed back on to Gareth Logue. It was Logie who dictated the game and even when Gerard OKane was sent out to mark him, the Steelstown mans movement caused Glenullin trouble. Steelstown were three points ahead when the first goal chance presented itself, but it fell to Glenullin. Dermot OKane picked out Paul Rafferty in front of goal but the low pile-driver was instinctively turned onto the bar by goalkeeper Marty Dunne. Seconds later Jacob Duffy had the ball over the bar at the other end. Brothers Dermot and Gerard OKane kicked two terric point, but it did little to stem Steelstowns incessant running game. Whoever is going to stop them, cant afford to drop off. They will need a half-forward line that will occupy them and top the overlap. When the first goal came, it was a majestic diagonal ball from full-back Shane OConnor who found Logue in space and his unstoppable shot went to the bottom corner of McKeowns net. Ryan Devine floated over a fine score from distance before Jacob Duffy made the second goal, with the strong-running Maguire blasting to the net. Steelstown missed three point chances before Maguire was blown up for over carrying when through on goal, almost ashe was caught in two minds to flick to the final support runner. Glenullin brought on three substitutes at the break. Brian Mullan was pulled out from goal with Eoin Bradley now stationed at full-forward. Early in the second-half he won a free but somehow spurned it from close range. He missed a chance in front of goal and the attacking unit didnt have the movement that would have tested Steelstown. At times Brian Mullan, who kept trying to push Glenullin forward, tried to float balls forward. The dference being was that the same space wasnt there that Gareth Logue made for the city men. The half took seven minutes to produce a first score. The move began with Dunnes monstrous kick over midfield, Rory Maguire was again involved and when the ball came from a Mark Foley, he was brilliantly denied by Eunan OKanes ing block, before Foley drilled over the . Then came a moment Gibson and his assistant Raymond Tracey wont be too happy with. Mark Foley had the ball at his feet in front of goal, with time to engineer a chance. He opted to lazily soccer the ball to Jacob Duffy who missed without working goalkeeper McKeown. On another day, this lack of urgency could be crucial. Ben McCarron and Darren McDaid, from opposite wings, floated over two sweet scores. And still the goal chances kept flooding in. After a neat move, McCarron and Jason McAleer created another opening but Maguires thundering shot hit the bar before spinning over. Maguire also brought out a fine save from goalkeeper McKeown who brilliant clawed the rebound clear, as the Steelstown attacks kept pouring forward. The chances Steelstown were mounting and missing had no bearing on the result. At the other end a fisted Eoin Bradley effort dropped into Dunnes arms and Conor Rafferty fired over when a goal was on, but it was always going to be Steelstowns day.

The fact he was man of the match in a dominant team tells enough about his performance. The finish for his goal combined power and accuracy to the bottom cover. With Ben McCarron playing further out, it was Logues running that made th Steelstown attack tick. MOMENT OF THE GAMEDUNNE SAVE – There were many scores in the game, but Marty Dunnes save was something . Dermot OKanes ball came in from the wing and Paul Rafferty just pulled on it along the ground and when the shot zipped off the turf, Dunne somehow got enough on the ball to prevent a goal that wouldve levelled the game in the thminute. TURNING POINTQUICK POINTS – While the first half goals gave Steelstown a , having Eoin Bradley lurking at full-forward meant they could not rest easy at the back. There were seven points between the teams with  minutes gone, but in the next five minutes Foley, McCarron, McDaid and McMonagle chipped in with scores to kill off the game.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

When he tossed a ball in the direction of his six year-old son Barry in the back garden, Barrys reaction was the watershed moment. Instead of catching the ball, he opted to put out his chest. Soccer was his first instinct andColeraine were going to take the first step out of junior football, teaching the basic components, as early as possible, was the priority. Otherwise soccer was always going to have first call on the youth of the Coleraine, Portstewart and Portrush triangle. googletag.cmd.push Fast forward  years and Barry would develop into a wing-forward and top scorer on Derrys  All-Ireland winning minor team and play at senior level for the county.   “It was a question of handling a ball, kicking it out of their hands and running with it – as opposed to dribbling it and chesting it.” SEAN McGOLDRICK  Richard Carey and Mark McTaggart were other future senior championship winners to go through Coleraines first underage coaching initiative. Armed with long-serving Kevin Mullan, Vinty McMahon and Brian Daly – whose son Barry scored the winning goal in the  final against Lavey – Sean set to work in Dominican College. It had to start somewhere. googletag.cmd.push “It was a question of handling a ball, kicking it out of their hands and running with it – as opposed to dribbling it and chesting it,” McGoldrick said in an interview before the  decider. What Coleraine have achieved with their persistence is nothing short of magnicent. And not against a backdrop of GAA tradition in the area, but one they grew themselves. The hub of it is the McGoldrick family who have formed the spine of teams, but imagine what could be done with the numbers in Derry City. Then again there are not many people in the world like Sean McGoldrick. This column has previously highlighted the lack of players to play senior football for Derry from outside the top flight. Of the  players, in the last  years, only  hail from non-senior clubs. From the city point of view, only Neil Forester, Eoghan Concannon and Ben McCarron from the city have played for the county at senior level. Thats a very sobering thought. Is all the money being invested worth it  You would have to wonder. It is dficult to break the mould against soccer, but more recently it is a totally dferent issue. Many young people in the city are not involved in any sport and the once vibrant Derry and District soccer league has been struggling. Whether we like it or not, unless the city can be properly harnessed then Derry, as a county, are always going to be fighting an uphill battle against the superpowers who are challenging for Sam. The college scene in the county is vibrant, with teams challenging for titles on a regular basis. St Patricks Maghera have led the way for years. St Marys Magherafelt – while having a signicant Tyrone and Antrim representation – have given Derry players a chance to play at a high level. St Pius had qualied for the MacLarnon final. St Colms Draperstown have been punching above their weight - despite picking from two clubs - and St Patricks and Brigids Claudy played in U finals. In Derry City, St Columbs Derry had a strong spine of boarders on their  Hogan Cup winning team. In more recent times, it has always had key players from outlying clubs Claudy and Craigbane. A worrying trend is that, apart from their MacLarnon team, the rest of the younger teams are playing at Grade C level in the new Ulster Schools format. A more recent development has been Cathair Dhoire, the amalgamation team in the city, which gave players in the city a taste of MacRory Cup football. The beauty of the Ulster Schools scene is that players can play at a higher level than they are getting at their club, often at a time when their club team is idle and against players from all over Ulster. It is a great bridge to county minor level. Any school coach I speak to, the first people they credit for success are the coaches in the feeder clubs. At the end of the day, a school just polishes the players and mould them into a team. If, as expected, money becomes available for Derry City to follow what Dublin, and more recently Belfast, are doing then it needs to be used wisely. Every penny that becomes available should be ploughed into getting the highest standard of GAA coaching into primary schools. Not concrete or infrastructure, with Doire Trasna now having their own pitch, coaching should be the only focus. Conrad McGuigan is a teacher in a city school and from a conversation I had with him lately, participation has never been higher. In the last six years the number of teams in the Tower Cup has risen from five to . He rated some of their players skills as every bit as good as what there is in his native Craigbane and surrounding clubs. The raw material is there. There has been a decline in the number of males going into the primary teaching profession andprincipals have extra people coming in to coach GAA as a key component of the schools PE curriculum, it has to be music to their ears. For me, the deal-breaker is accountability. To avail of the coaching, a primary school must have a link to the local club. No link, no deal. And it has to be done properly and a stringent review taken place every year. It wouldnt be hard to cross check names from the school teams with club records and eventually U team sheets. Any school or club not pulling their weight simply gets omitted from the funding. Money cannot be wasted on just ticking a box. There is no point in players learning all the skills and not transferring it to a club. Thats where the real gains are. A player who canpush for the countyminorteamandhave a  plus year club senior career. A rising tide lts all boats and the cream will eventually creep into the senior inter-county scene. Any new plan for the city will be the last throw of the dice at engaging a population base that could transform Derry as a county. It will take time, but unless it isproperly audited there is no point. If they can squeeze every drop of potential like Coleraine did, it would be a serious addition.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April.

The test site has now moved to the Lycra car rarkin Maydown. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. googletag.cmd.push These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. googletag.cmd.push “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jim McReynolds, the popular former owner of McReynold’s Bar, died peacefully last week at his home in Dungiven. Mourners at his funeral heard how Jim had given his time generously to his parish, community and family le. “Jim was a man of faith and trusted in God all his le,” Fr Seamus Kelly told the congregation. “He was very involved in the le of this parish, taking up the collection, doing his time working with St Vincent de Paul, helping and supporting people. googletag.cmd.push “Growing up he was an excellent footballer and represented Dungiven with distinction, gaining a place on the Derry minor team in . “He sponsored many groups and clubs down the years, and club members often said that Jim was the saviour of the hurling club on many occasions. “Even when they hadn’t the money, he would have bought hurls and kits where required until they could raise the funds.” Jim was dedicated to the bar, running what Fr Kelly described as a ‘tight ship’, and he helped cement the bar’s place as a community hub in the town. “He ran a tight ship in his pub. He did not make sales or money his god, but often refused to serve customers he thought were too young or who had already had enough to drink,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “McReynold’s Bar has been famous, not only in Dungiven, as it was the only chief landmark for weary and thirsty travellers from all over the world, and it remains as popular today. “Just last year I had a friend or two visiting and the person wanted a pint, so I said I’d take them down to the best pub in town, McReynold’s Bar, and we had a few pints there. “He had a ready ear for customers’ problems, which were always treated confidentially, and he helped countless numbers of people in a iety of ways over the years. “I’m also told Jim enjoyed cooking and often provided the family meal. The children wouldfrom school, and Rose from teaching, to find a dinner waiting for them. “It had been cooked by Jim while he dodged in and out between the bar and the house, keeping the customers happy as well.” Fr Kelly also spoke of how Jim’s love and commitment to his family, in particular his we Rose, shone through in all that he did. “He met and fell in love with a wonderful Drumsurn girl, Rose Boyle, who was a teacher in her local school.” he said.  “Once they met, Rose and Jim had eyes only for each other and naturally they got married in Drumsurn chapel  years ago. “He loved the cottage in Donegal and was in his element entertaining family and friends when he got off there for a break. I’ve no doubt it holds great memories for all the family. “I enjoyed my visits to Jim and Rose when we were able to visit the sick, Fr Joseph and myself always got a great welcome. “Jim was most generous and appreciated having Holy Communion brought to him when he could no longer go to Mass. “He and Rose always sat side-by-side and I could sense the closeness in their relationship together. I know all the family will miss Jim, but especially his dear we, Rose.” Jim is survived by Rose and his children Finvola, Siobhan, Fanchea, Bernard, Bronagh and Ciara. He was the much-loved grandfather of James, Claire, Anne, Michael, Chris, Katy, Patrick, Cathal, Domnaill, Conal, Niall, Ciaran, Oliver, Liam, Ellen-Rose and great grandfather of Darragh. Jim was pre-deceased by his siblings Frances, Mary, Jean, Patsy, Kathleen and Tony.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lisa McGee was doing her A-Levels at Thornhill College when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in , and grew up knowing about Mr Humes work for the peace process. He was just there all the time, she recalled. There wasnt a time that you didnt know about him. There was never any debate about it, he was a good man. At a time where everything was debated about and talked about nobody ever questioned that. Not that you would ever have needed to, or have wanted to, question what he was doing. googletag.cmd.push Ms McGee said the news of Mr Humes death on Monday morning came as a shock, despite knowing that he had been ill for some time. He was a hero who walked among us, she said. I got really upset I was surprised at how emotional I felt. We were just so used to having him. It was phenomenal what he did, the influence he had and the amazing vision of what our future should be. Ms McGee believes hundreds of people owe their le to Mr Hume, due to his role in the cessation of violence. He was an incredible person and he was sent here for a reason, she said. googletag.cmd.push I was just thinking yesterday of all the people that may not be herehe hadnt been able to do what he did and built the peace process. When you think of everything he did and he never gave up- thank God. Ms McGee doesnt knowJohn Hume ever watched Derry Girls, but she hopes he would have approved. I dont knowhe ever saw it, but he and Pat knew I was a big fan, she said. I hope they thought it was alright. He was always in the background in the news, so he was present in the show. And Erin chats about him a lot in the Derry Girls book that I did recently. There would be no Derry Girls without John Hume because I wouldnt have had the opportunities that I had,” she added. The Derry writer that she wants her two young children to learn about John Hume as they grow up. There was an amazing image of him on the front of thetoday [Tuesday] and I want to get that framed for the house because its important that they know about him, she said. This was always going to be a very sad time because it was always going to be about looking back over the past and that was a very painful time in our history. It has been a sad thing for me that towards the end of his le he couldnt remember everything he achieved. Thats why we have to remember for him.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He noticed that for special occasions people in the city rush out to buy a personalised cake from Doherty’s Bakery and thought why not also give them a special memento they can hold on to forever. Christopher Ferry is a Derry man with over  years’ experience in the design industry. He has won ious awards in that time for graphic design and social media management through his work with local businesses. Being on furlough at the moment and confined to his home during lockdown, he felt there was no time like the present to kickstart his own business, aptly named Ferry Clever. googletag.cmd.push It allows people to personalise cards or buy those with famous Derry faces for every occasion. A host of Maiden City icons appear on cards such as John Hume, Nadine Coyle, Micky Doherty , Pat Ramsey and places such as Free Derry Corner, the City Walls and, of course, The Ice Wharf.  Most of them are accompanied by local sayings, for example the common phrase ‘I love you to the moon and back’ is given a local spin to read, ‘I love you to the Bog and back’, with a sketch of the Bogside as the backdrop. It is not just cards but personalised images that can be framed, with a Liverpool-themed design currently proving popular after they were crowned Premier League champions. googletag.cmd.push Families can customise an image of them standing outside the Shankly Gates where it says ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’. The business has been built at home but Christopher’s ambition is to eventually open a shop in the city centre where the tagline will be ‘make it personal’. Working as a DJ he has established relationships with numerous bars and businesses in the town. “Years and years ago they seen me doing the designs for my own posters, this was back when social media was starting to explode, and they asked meI fancied doing posters for them. “I’d do everything from menus printed in their premises, posters, social media campaigns, to online videos – the lot. “But now I want to go full pelt at it and open my own business.” Recently he was in the town looking for a Father’s Day card and couldn’t find any he liked.  He said: “I thought it would be greatyou could just go on to some place and they could make the card for you. “So I thought, you know what, I’m going to try this as well.” He started off selling on the website Etsy and sales have been rising, ‘people are just buying the cards flat to the mat at the minute’, he added. As someone who is social media savvy, he has been keeping an eye on trends and designing cards accordingly. During lockdown the charity work of local celebrity Micky Doherty was well publicised which is why his image was selected to grace one of the cards.  The ultimate ambition for Christopher is to be the ‘go-to person’ whenever a special occasion comes up. “In Derry, and all over the world, it’s always going to be someone’s birthday, it’s always going to be Christmas, it’s always going to be Father’s Day so I just want them thinking of me for a card.” Micky Doherty said he loved the cards. “Im totally honoured,” he said. “Like someone wants a birthday card with my face on it, he laughed.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, because of the coronavirus restrictions, an audience of only  people will be allowed into each performance. The auditorium at the Playhouse usually has room for  people.

Rather than having all these empty chairs that would be housing absence, we would be housing something of signicance,” he said. Kieran Grfiths, Producer Director of thePlayhouse, said they believed it was a fitting memorial for people who have passed away. “Like a low-laying fog, grief has sat amongst us all this year,” he said. “It’s grey, feels impossible to lt and kicking it sees it rise around us. “Our plan is to honour that grief and to fight through with resilience and creativity to simply try and make something move.” googletag.cmd.push As well as being performed live in front of a small audience, the play will also be broadcast live on the internet.

Chief Executive Paul Clancy has said the Northern Ireland Executive’s decision to make the wearing of face masks mandatory in shops is positive news because it protects both shoppers and staff. The decision also gives more certainty to businesses about the steps that need to be taken to keep people, including staff, safe. In a survey carried out with the Chamber’s members last week, % of  respondents supported the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops by the public. googletag.cmd.push Londonderry Chamber Chief Executive Paul Clancy said: “We are glad to see some certainty on this issue. A vast majority of our own members in the North West are supportive of the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops because they recognise that it protects the health and safety of their own staff, as well as customers. “The reality is that we will all have to make some changes to how we live, work, shop and socialise andthe wearing of face coverings is mandatory, it will help promote more of a cultural change in the acceptability of wearing face coverings. googletag.cmd.push “Shops in the city have put in place new measures and changes which will protect their customers and staff. Many retailers have invested a great deal of time and money to make people feel safe and secure and it is important that customers support the new guidelines. “This has been an enormous time of change, but we must all play our part to protect public health, keep the spread of coronavirus to a minimum and avoid a second wave which will be catastrophic for many businesses. “I hope that people will embrace this change and support local businesses as they try to navigate this new landscape. I would also urge members of the public to be mindful of shop staff and treat them with patience and respect. “The number one priority of retailers is the welfare and safety of their customers and staff and have taken these measures to protect everyone. By shopping local and staying local, we can support small businesses who have been impacted by the lockdown.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The new vaccine research registrywill help large numbers of people to be recruited into trials over the coming months, potentially leading to an effective vaccine being identied and made available to the UK public against coronavirus sooner. It has been developed as part of the UK Government’s Vaccine Taskforce, in partnership with the National Institute for Health Research , NHS Digital, and the Northern Ireland, Scottish and Welsh Governments. Dr Janice Bailie, Assistant Director, RD Division, Public Health Agency, said: “Health researchers are currently working to find a vaccine for COVID-, but without the help of members of the general public willing to participate in vaccine trials, this work will not be able to succeed. googletag.cmd.push “The NHS COVID- vaccine registry allows people to register their interest and be potentially contacted with an offer to participate in clinical studies. “You can sign up to give permission for researchers to contact you about taking part in COVID- vaccine studies. By collecting details about people who are interested in taking part in vaccine studies, the registry service will help cut down the time it takes to find volunteers for vaccine studies. This will help us to carry out studies and find a vaccine faster.” The registry is available to anyone aged  or over, living in the UK. To register, people fill in some personal and contact details, and answer a series of basic health screening questions on an NHS web form atwww.nhs.uk researchcontact. googletag.cmd.push   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The league leaders were in danger of dropping their first points of the season after Walter Figuiras first half goal had given the Candystripes the lead, but an own goal from Colm Horgan and a follow up from Roberto Lopes maintained the % record this season. Derry kept their shape throughout an uneventful first half, with Rovers bossing possession, but without ever really causing a threat, a half chance for Danny Lafferty, on histo the Brandywell, the only effort Rovers had in the first half hour. googletag.cmd.push The first half was drting uneventfully towards half time when the first goal arrived out of absolutely nowhere. Eoin Toal collected the ball on half way and decided to join the attack, bursting between two Rovers players before finding Walter Figueira on the left wing. Toal continued into the penalty area in anticipation of a cross, which was duly delivered, but incredibly, the ball eluded both Roberto Lopes and Alan Mannus with the ball sneaking into the net past the bemused Rovers players. Stephen Bradley was far from happy with his teams inability to test Peter Cherrie and midway through the second half he had used all of his substitutes to completely change the look of his attack. googletag.cmd.push Those substitutions had the desired effect as Rovers finally levelled on  minutes, but there was still an element of luck about the goal. Gaffney did well to pick out a cross from the right and a glancing header by Williams went over Cherrie but onto the post before it bounced off the unfortunate Colm Horgan and into the net. Rovers were relentless after that, and, buoyed by the goal, they went in search of a winner, and they thought they had it when Farrugia went in from the left and picked out Williams, but he was denied from close range by a superb save by Peter Cherrie. But the goal was coming and City were unable to defend the resulting short corner, Burke receiving the ball in the area before sending it into the mix where Lopes was on hand to fire it past Cherrie to turn the game completely on its head with just eight minutes remaining. There was a chance late on for a City equaliser when Ciaron Harkin and Colm Horgan combined to set up Figueira, but his effort was too close to Mannus who gathered comfortably. City continued to push in five minutes of added time and they came so close to levelling when Adam Hamills cross was met brilliantly by Harkin who headed onto the crossbar before Mannus somehow kept out Toals follow-up.

Ryan OrsquoHiggins opened the scoring early on before Jerome Johnston and Marty Devlin replied for the Ulster champions.The industrious Paddy Sheridan levelled matters in the tenth minute with Martin McCourt giving the Magpies the slightest lead by the water break.Both sides continued to probe before half time with scores hard to come by.

Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding. Upgrading town centre sewers is an important scheme and NI Water must honour its commitment to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said improving the town centrersquos waste water infrastructure was good news for residents and the business community.He added :ldquoThe suggested timetable to complete the work is five weeks and I hope that every effort will be made to ensure that back-to-school traffic is not impacted as the start of the new term is less than one month away..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick Cricket.jpg","title":"Downpatrick see off Saintfield by four runs in close contest  ","story":"WHAT a dference  hours makes in the game of cricket.Downpatrick, who had been humbled by Ballymena on Thursday, got back to winning ways at Saintfield with the batsmen showing some pride and application.Ross Boultwood won the toss and decided to bat first.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the decision in early August.ldquoI proposed the initiative to encourage shoppers back into Downpatrick to provide a boost for our local businesses who have continued to provide key services during the pandemic and the easing of lockdown restrictions, Cllr Sharvin explained.He revealed that when he used the Irish Street, Scotch Street and Church Street car parks theywere extremely busy and he was

to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to Downpatrick and in my proposal to extend the scheme until August , I have asked that the car park strategy the council is completing is fast tracked.ldquoThis is important to ensure equality across the district and to review the car park tarf of p an hour, with a reduction in the hourly rate being considered.Cllr Sharvin said while shoppers will not have to pay to park for almost two more weeks, he has vowed to continue working with local businesses to ensure that the local authority is doing everything it can do to support them.He added: ldquoWith this feedback from local businesses, I would not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my opinion, was counter productive to the reason why councillors had agreed to the extended free parking to encourage people to shop locally and provide businesses with some breathing space to adapt to

Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind.

We have seen a rise in the number of confirmed Covid- cases, the R number increasing and a delay in the re-opening of non-food serving pubs.These developments underline the stark reality that the coronavirus is not fading away. It is here for the long-term and remains highly infectious. It needs no second invitation to spread.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Dr Michael McBride is chief medical officer of Northern Ireland.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press EyeThe people of Northern Ireland have done really well in terms of following public advice during this pandemic.Many younger people put their lives on hold to protect their parents and grandparents. Many people at most risk shielded for many months and many people saw their livelihoods suffer. Great sacrices have been made and many lives have been saved as a result.But there have been worrying signs that fatigue has led to carelessness and that some complacency might be creeping in.We remain deeply concerned that Covid- cases could peak sharply here in the autumn or winter. Whether this happens or not is up to us all. The virus doesn’t have a plan — its spread depends on our actions. Professor Ian Young is Chief Scientic Adviser to the Department of Health. Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.The consequences for many iniduals and for our health service could be extremely serious — not least because health and social care provision is always especially fragile during winter.However, we should not be defeatist about the months ahead.As ever, the challenge involves plotting a sensible course between complacency and panic.With a sustained collective effort across society, we can stay on top of the situation. We can keep protecting ourselves and others, especially those most vulnerable to the virus.We now know much more about Covid-. We have built up our testing and contact tracing infrastructure and we have some more effective treatments.This remains a vicious virus which can be lethal for many and we need to protect them. As ever, everyone at all levels of the health and social care system will do their best to keep the population as safe as possible. They will not be found wanting. Now that the clapping has stopped, please continue to protect our health service and staff by doing the right thing. Every citizen has to play their part.That means following these five key steps we keep talking about.• Watch your distance.Keeping your distance remains essential when you are out and about. Remember, the virus doesn’t spread itself. People spread it, particularly through droplets from the mouth and nose.• Wash hands well and frequently.This is particularly important after touching hard surfaces that may have other people’s droplets on them.• Wear face coverings in enclosed spaces and where social distancing is dficult.This is now legally required for certain indoor settings, including shops. Don’t be a droplet spreader. And when you are not wearing a face covering, cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze.• Co-operate with the Test, Trace and Protect programme in terms of getting tested and self-isolating when required.• Download the StopCOVID NI proximity app to support contact tracing and help break chains of transmission.Given what we have been through as a society this year already, these five steps are surely not beyond us all. Le continues to be tough for so many of our citizens. There is no easy way to get through this unprecedented period in our lives, no simple solution to the challenges we face.We obviously want to take every feasible measure to prevent the spread of Covid-.At the same time, another lockdown would have very serious consequences for our economy, our society, our health service and the mental and physical health of many iniduals.We have no option but to work together and take all the necessary steps to stay safe.WATCH, WASH, WEAR. We really must do it to get through it. This is a responsibility on all of us.• Dr Michael McBride is Chief Medical Officer and Professor Ian Young is Chief Scientic Adviser——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It wasn’t highlighted by mainstream nationalist leaders\" Fate had decided he would be born Roman Catholic and I Protestant. The bricks and mortar in his house came from the same quarry as built mine. The unemployment and poor housing conditions on my side of the Foyle were the same as on his side. He began his political career in the mid-sixties while mine began in the late seventies. Our political careers overlapped in the early s when we both were at Stormont, and then as MPs for adjoining constituencies from  to . During that time, despite our political dferences we enjoyed a cordial personal relationship and worked together to deliver for people in our constituencies.Gregory Campbell MP signing the Book of Condolences for John Hume in the Guildhall, Londonderry.Picture by Lorcan Doherty   Press EyeThere has been a myriad of ‘defining moments’ in the lives of people here over the last  years but there have been two periods that more than any other shaped the Northern Ireland of . The first period was the birth of the Troubles from  onwards, the second period was the ending of those same Troubles.In the midst of earnest tributes to John Hume, we must not forget or be mistaken about what happened in those two periods. The period - was the one with the highest death toll in the Troubles. What happened then to the unionist minority in the City of Hume and Campbell has been almost completely overlooked in the commentary of recent days. The exodus of unionists occurred when peaceful nationalism and violent republicanism was on the rise. Nothing was done by nationalist leaders to highlight it let alone prevent it. If in a unionist majority city virtually an entire nationalist minority in the main part of that city, had fled, mostly under threat, with dozens of funeral corteges being their final farewell, would those leaders have been so silent If this had happened when any unionist leader was prominent, it would have seen them pilloried and rightly criticised, yet this is what happened between  and  in Londonderry to unionists. It wasn’t highlighted by mainstream nationalist leaders at the time, and no mainstream media outlet referred to it this week. The much vaunted ‘need for balance’ was conspicuously absent.At the other end of the timescale was the - period just before the ceasefires. At that early stage, only a few people were aware of the Hume Adams discussions.Very few were also aware of the scale of the security services infiltration of the Provisional IRA. The wider public had no knowledge of those who would later be outed as agents from within the secret ranks of the IRA. Martin McGuinness in the documentary ‘Real Lives’ had said in the early s thatsomeone showed the IRA ‘another way’ to achieve their objective, apart from violence, they would take it.The mainstream journalistic narrative following John Hume’s death both locally and internationally was effectively that the IRA had to be cajoled and dragged into a gradual move towards peace.Very few journalists recognised that the IRA was desperately seeking a way out of their terror tactic. A Troubles weary people were tiring of their terror and their best ‘activists’ were increasingly known to be agents.That is why the Provos made their long overdue move towards peace. Anyone declaring that peace would not have happened without John Hume, must give voice to the view that a desperate, depleted IRA were looking for an escape route with a long-term united Ireland fig leaf for cover.• Gregory Campbell is DUP MP for East Londonderry——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Most of that was weighted towards the early days of lockdown.Experts are worried that the full extent of Britainrsquos jobs problems has been hidden by the Governmentrsquos furlough scheme, which promised to cover % of the salaries of staff who could not work because of lockdown.These furloughed workers are still considered to be employed, but many worry they will have no job to come back to when the scheme winds down.The furlough scheme ends in October, though the Government has promised a pound, per employee bonus to any company that brings back furloughed staff and keeps paying them until January.ldquoWhile the headline data continues to lag behind the reality on the ground, the decline in the number of employees on payrolls and hours worked is further evidence of the damage being done to the UK labour market by the coronavirus pandemic, said Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce.ldquoThe furlough scheme has been successful in preserving millions of jobs.ldquoHowever, with firms continuing to face a perfect storm of increased costs, reduced demand, and diminished cash reserves, unemployment is likely to surge as the Government support schemes wind down, unless action is taken.Chancellor Rishi Sunak, said: ldquoTodayrsquos labour market stats make it clear that our unprecedented support measures, including the furlough and self-employed support schemes, are working to safeguard millions of jobs and livelihoods that could otherwise have been lost..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Around , jobs lost since lockdown started article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Since ing to site Farrans, the contractor in charge of the build, has ensured the contract is completed ready for opening in the Autumn.Farrans has been spearheading the build since initial enabling works got under way early in , creating  jobs on site during construction as part of a project which has delivered at least £. million in direct wages to the local economy.Located at the south side of Craigavon’s balancing lake, the facility is a landmark venue for the area and is situated within a pre-existing network of walking and cycling paths covering around three miles.

Kiro.“Kiro has given us such respite. He is such a great puppy. He loves walking and is very happy. We couldn’t understand it when we heard clicking sounds on his hips,” said Christopher.He said when they visited the owner of the pups, they saw the puppy’s mother and were assured by the woman they had bought Kiro from that both were in good health. “They all looked to be in good health,” said Christopher.He explained that they took him to the vet for his first injections. “The vet stretched his hips and said everything was Ok,” said Christopher.Kiro“We became concerned as he was starting to ‘bunny hop’ when he was running andwe picked him up he would yelp,” he said.They took Kiro back to the same veterinary surgery for the second set of injections. Christopher said they were told that everything was good.But two weeks ago they noticed his hips were ‘clicking’.This time they went to a vets in Lurgan who said they could feel Kiro’s hips were ‘pretty bad’.“He has Canine Juvenile Hip Dysplasia and it is pretty bad,” said Christopher.The -year-old who isn’t working and is a full time carer for his mother and father, said they had taken out pet insurance but sadly it was not enough cover for this particular condition.He explained that it is a genetic condition and rectying it with a double hip replacement is going to cost around £k. Already they have managed to raise £,.“To give you an idea of how bad his case is, our vet explained that the worst case scenario would be a score of , where malamutes usually sit at around a .. Kiro’s hip scores are a .. This means he will require two hip replacements pretty much as soon as possible.“We understand it’s a dficult time to be asking for donations, and this is a last resort for us. “Our aim is to raise enough funds to get Kiro a double total hip replacement which would give him a new lease of le. “However,we aren’t able to raise enough funds for this, we will be using the money to give Kiro a double partial hip replacement which will help to signicantly reduce his pain. “Our vet also explained to us that by the time he is two years old, his condition will have worsened, therefore it is important we are able to give him the care he needs as soon as possible.”If you would like to help check out the Go Fund Me page here https:www.gofundme f kiros-hip-replacements utm_sourcecustomerutm_mediumcopy_linkutm_campaignp_cf+share-flow-fbclidIwARpDXrMFqgiBCOaISkLOKBos_YVaGicl_YbRFBEIpWJRHJOMYLrkA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

and could bring  jobs to the town, a local councillor has said.By The NewsroomFriday, th August , : pmUpdated Friday, th August , : pm\"\"The application, lodged by applicant Inaltus Ltd on behalf of Curly Properties Ltd is for a retail development with car parking, landscaping, access and associated site works developed atvacant lands north of Millennium Way, Lurgan.Originally submitted in  the planning proposal has been recommended for approval by Council’s planning officers and will,approved, see Home Bargains arrive in town.Speaking in support of the application, Councillor Joe Nelson said it would bring “signicant economic benefits… including some  new jobs” to Lurgan.“I believe the site location is ideal for this development as it provides adequate car parking in situ and is located on Millenium Way which is in fact the relief road for Lurgan Town Centre,” say the SDLP councillor.“Bringing this development to the town while keeping the town centre free from extra congestion is the ideal position.“I strongly support these proposals and trust that the material considerations, associated with the economic and other benefits of the scheme, will be considered in detail by the Council planners.”Upper Bann MLA Jonathan Buckley has expressed “strong support” for the application.“The proposals will see the delivery of a Home Bargains store for Lurgan along with signicant economic benefits including a multi-million pound investment into the local economy and the creation of some  new jobs,” said the DUP MLA“At a time when many people are losing their jobs and many businesses are having to close, proposal such as this, where successful major retailingbusinesses are willing to commit to Lurgan, the Council must give very serious consideration to these proposals.”However, an independentreview of the application by Tom Stokes Associated Planning expressed concerns that rather than support the town centre, the application,approved, is “more likely to create an alternative retail destination to the town centre”.The report said that with  per cent of the Lurgan town centre’s turnover allocated to just two stores, the remaining smaller conveniencestores in Lurgan could be “vulnerable to impact” by the approval of this application.The review also suggested that the proposal would be better suited to the former Tesco site in Castle Lane as it is “a key regeneration site in the town centre”.However, in response to this, the application’s agent, Inaltus Ltd, said: “If this site did not suit Tesco’s servicing requirements, there are no grounds for TSA to suggest it will suit Home Bargains.”In conclusion Inaltus Ltd’s response to TSA assessmentstates that whilst some aspects of the TSA Review can be agreed “other aspects are illogical and do not form a sound basis to refuse the proposal on”.It also notes that no objections have been lodged in over  months and called for the application to be brought before Council’s planning committee.The application is now set to appear before Wednesday’smeeting of the planning committee, with officer’s recommending that the application is approved.-------A message from the
