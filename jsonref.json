President Trump has also mulled walking away from the New START treaty, which is due for renewal in 2021. If that falls through, there would be no limits on the world\u0027s two biggest nuclear powers for the first time in half a centuryIt was hoped this would reduce the risk of nuclear war, since neither country would be willing to use their largest weapons for fear of their destructive power.   German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said this week that the collapse of the treaty means a bit of security in Europe is being lost.\u0027We regret the fact that Russia has not done what was necessary to save the INF treaty. Now we call all the more on Russia and the U.S. to preserve the New START treaty as a cornerstone of worldwide arms control,\u0027 Maas said. \u0027Nuclear powers such as China must also face up to their responsibility on arms control - they have more weight in the world than at the time of the Cold War.\u0027Arms control advocates remain worried about the future.Laura Kennedy, who formerly represented the U.S. at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, warned Americans not to let their eyes glaze over when confronted with the complex diplomacy of arms control. She said they should raise the issue now with Congress and all candidates running for the White House in 2020.\u0027This isn\u0027t `wonkiness.\u0027 It\u0027s our future and the future of the planet,\u0027 Kennedy said. \u0027Nuclear issues are so consequential that we simply cannot abandon a serious arms control effort. Nor can the U.S. afford to cite its concerns over INF or other issues as an excuse to let the New START treaty lapse.\u0027Over its lifetime, the 1987 so-called INF treaty led to the elimination of 2,692 U.S. and Soviet Union nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles. Until its demise, the treaty banned land-based missiles with a range between 500 and 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,410 miles).David Wright, co-director of the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said withdrawing from the treaty was \u0027shortsighted.\u0027 He said it will trigger a competition in conventionally armed missiles that will undermine stability.         America has also complained that the deal hampers its ability to counter threats from China, which was never a signatory to the deal (pictured, a Chinese guided missile destroyer)Wright also noted Russia\u0027s has complained about U.S. missile systems in Poland and Romania. Wright said they are intended to launch interceptor missiles in defense, but appear to be capable of launching offensive cruise missiles as well.\u0027To claim the United States is justified in pulling out of the treaty because of Russian violations does not take the full picture into account,\u0027 said Wright, who accuses the Trump administration of being averse to any negotiated agreements that constrain U.S. weapons systems.Former national intelligence director Dan Coats, however, told Congress late last year that intelligence officials believed it was Russia that no longer wanted to be constrained by the INF treaty as it modernized its military with precision-strike missiles ostensibly designed to target critical military and economic sites in Europe. He said the U.S. thought Russia\u0027s objective all along was to keep the U.S. tethered to the deal while it quietly built and deployed missiles that violated the treaty and threatened Europe.U.S. officials first raised its concerns that Russia was violating the treaty during the Obama administration and said Moscow spent six years rebuffing U.S. efforts to prod it back into compliance. In February, Trump determined that Moscow was in material breach of the treaty and the U.S. suspended its own obligations under the treaty. That started a six-month clock to get Russia back into compliance - time that ran out on Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d941004377786d607f439fd542378d4ae2bc9eb6/0_1482_2470_1481/master/2470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2dfb6cc45dca6773fe1e804ffa3b466e","title":"philip pocock best photograph miriam berlin punk and her rat bestia","story":"‘The punks were sceptical of my presence. One guy even headbutted me. In retrospect, I think it was a sign of acceptance’I was in my mid-20s when Cornell Capa, director of the International Center of Photography in New York, recommended me for a job documenting life in the American sector of Berlin while the city was still ided. As a young photographer, I was so nervous. All of these senior German officials were swanning around my studio inspecting my work.I blurted out that I wasn’t American, that I was born in Canada, almost like a confession. I felt I had to tell them. They just looked at me quizzically, laughed and started speaking in German. I have no idea what they thought of me. But I got the job.In the west, I discovered a different side to the disorder. Every Saturday, punks would hang out, drink beer and blare music through their soundsystems. Cars would be set alight and bank windows smashed in. The cops would arrive, teargas them and send them running to find shelter in nearby bars, and the whole cycle would repeat. They were sceptical of me to begin with. One guy even headbutted me. In retrospect, I think that was a sign of acceptance.Getting to know them wasn’t easy, and it happened in the strangest of ways. I would carry a bunch of bananas to snack on while I wandered the streets. When I found the punks, I didn’t know what to say, so I offered them bananas. They just laughed at me. But they must have liked it, because they welcomed me into their crew.As I got to know them, I realised they fitted into the idea of the “wall sickness”, but they were the manic side of the depression that reigned in the east. There was something psychotic about punk at the time. These weren’t just weekend punks and “punk” wasn’t just a look – this was their life.The woman in this shot was called Miriam, and the rat on her shoulder is called Bestia. It was a week or so before Reagan was planning to visit, and there were windows smashed all over the city in protest. Despite the violence and the militancy, she was extremely gentle. She was big, much bigger than me, but she had a soft way of gesturing and moving.She invited me to her place, a nearby squat. We hung out, drank tea, took some shots and became friends. She introduced me to her rat, Bestia, who lived in her oven. Being a squat, it had no electricity, so it was perfectly safe. Bestia was almost like a  angel for Miriam, keeping her safe amid the anarchy. I think it was useful to keep guys off her back, too – nobody’s messing when you have a rat draped around your neck.People feel this image represents a moment in Berlin’s history, or the punk movement more broadly, but to me it’s a shot of someone I got to know, who welcomed me into a hard-to-reach scene. It was a doorway for me into other activist and protest scenes, and I remember the time fondly.People seem to think that punk has died, and maybe elements of the aesthetic have. But the spirit of punk was so much more than a look, and I think that lives on, albeit in different forms. I think we saw it in the Occupy movement, within elements of the Arab spring, and I think we are seeing it today in the UK with Extinction Rebellion.Training: Film and television production, New York University.Influences: Diane Arbus, Brassaï, the Capa brothers, Eikoh Hosoe, André Kertész, Dorothea Lange, Helen Levitt, Mary Ellen Mark, László Moholy-Nagy, Gordon Parks, Thomas Ruff, Aaron Siskind, Francesca Woodman.Low point: “A life-changing accident on a film set in 1979.”Top tip: “Draw with your eyes.

After all, George Saunders was his university tutor and later became a friend. The writer’s writer Lynne Tillman was his mentor. Roxane Gay has stamped a cover quote on Friday Black, his debut short story collection, urging the world simply to “read this book”.The dozen stories have been written over the course of eight or nine years, mercilessly revised and chosen by him from a bank of about 80. “Let’s say 70 of those 80 are trash. No, really, they were never going to be anything more than terrible … An idea is not enough, you could have a thousand good ideas every day. Usually, I have somebody’s voice in my mind for the stories that actually take.” Those stories that did make the final cut have been precisely edited to work together like a concept album in rhythm and style and beat, Adjei-Brenyah delivers a wildly creative collection that isn’t so much dealing with race, capitalism, violence, poverty, abortion and injustice as it is telling it from the inside out with blood and guts. At his most confident, he is driven by the idea that “maybe they could help someone feel seen. I thought they could push the conversation in a direction that mattered.” Adjei-Brenyah’s work is often called “timely” and Friday Black opens with “The Finkelstein 5”, a visceral account of murdered black children, decapitated by an attacker with a chainsaw. And it doesn’t let up. He imagines a dystopia in which corpses are swept from the floors of Black Friday sales where aborted twin foetuses, grey and dry, fight each other and compete for affection. In reference to the killer of teenager Trayvon Martin, he creates Zimmer Land: a theme park for white people to act out brutal fantasies against people of colour. Saunders describes the stories in Friday Black as “strange, crazed, urgent and funny” – and you can imagine film-makers such as Jordan Peele or Kahlil Joseph putting them on screen.“The fact that people are willing to think about it is good, but the problems that we’re trying to deal with might take a long time to sort out. It’s terrifying to think what will happen at the next election but I think overall, we’re hopefully going to trend towards something better.”As the son of Ghanaian immigrants to the US – a lawyer father and teacher mother – whose health and finances both suffered in their new country, Adjei-Brenyah is wary of how good America is at conflating “morality with things … like the acquisition of stuff is a duty? It’s weird.”His family moved from Queens, New York, when he was seven years old and settled in Spring Valley, a predominantly immigrant community 22 miles north of Manhattan. “All it takes is one person getting sick and your house is foreclosed,” he says, recalling what his family went through. “Now you’re getting evicted ... We had a period where we were comfortable – seeing that change pretty quickly is part of why I am so suspicious.”The time he spent working in retail – a job he was only able to give up a few years ago – has also gone some way to shaping his thinking. Now he teaches at Syracuse University where he received his MFA in creative writing. He has just bought his first TV his first laptop was bought for him by his older sister, well after he had started college and been overwhelmed by “all these kids in every class with their MacBooks.Adjei-Brenyah was in college at SUNY Albany when Trayvon Martin was murdered. It was a pivotal moment for him he and a friend created pamphlets and stayed up until 3am distributing them across campus. “We were self-righteous … We fixed racism, you know! We felt we had to galvanise, we woke up expecting to see the new world order we had ushered in.” Nothing happened. “We saw the janitor sweeping all the pamphlets away. We had pretty much just littered.” He laughs.“I remember not liking it ... but it was good for me. Rather than saying: ‘This is me and my wisdom and this is how you do it and live your life,’ what I learned is to ask questions instead. Which is when it starts sounding corny … in that I try to ask important questions.” He does not want to sound grand. “Because even asking questions creates some kind of truth. You’ve just got to be willing to look at it hard and say something real.”• Friday Black is published by Quercus (RRP £8.99) . To order a copy go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

But as plastic grass takes over our cities, some say that it’s green only in colourIf your attention during the Women’s World Cup was on the pitch rather than the players, you might have noticed that the matches were all played on real grass. That was a hard-won change, made after the US team complained to Fifa that they sustained more injuries on artificial turf.In private gardens, however, the opposite trend is happening: British gardens are being dug up and replaced with plastic grass. But this isn’t the flaky, fading stuff on which oranges were once displayed at the greengrocer. Today’s artificial grass is nearly identical to the real thing.With products named after beautiful places – Lake District, Valencia – modern artificial turf mimics not just the mottled colouring and shape of grass blades, but the warm springiness of earth.Unlike the grass itself, the market is growing. Dozens of specialist firms now market fake grass as a replacement for garden lawns. UK sales surged during last year’s record summer temperatures, according to the industry journal Hortweek, while a report by Up Market Research valued the global market at $2.5bn (£2bn) in 2016 and forecasts a “staggering” rise to $5.8bn by 2023.Andy Driver, sales and marketing director for the artificial turf supplier Evergreens UK, says that as artificial grass has become much cheaper and more realistic, it now appeals to a wide range of people: city residents with shaded gardens where grass doesn’t grow well, or to carpet urban rooftops and balconies families with children or dogs who don’t want a muddy mess older or disabled people who struggle to maintain a garden schools and nurseries where playgrounds get heavy use.For many people, he says, there is a social pressure to “keep up with the Joneses” by having a perfectly trimmed, green lawn all year round.Perhaps aware of another kind of social pressure, some firms pitch their products as eco-friendly alternatives.For example, Royal Grass says its environmentally friendly turf, called Eco-Sense, is recyclable (“in other words, cradle-to-cradle”) and declares that it “has the look and feel of natural grass, but outperforms its natural source of inspiration”: “‘Green’ is a premium goal in our quest on how we can make our artificial grass more sustainable. This starts at the beginning of the process, with the careful selection of the raw materials that are used to produce the grass blades.”But while the fake grass might indeed be greener, at least in colour, its environmental impacts are difficult to gloss over.Paul Hetherington, fundraising director for the charity Buglife, says artificial turf is far from an eco-friendly alternative to natural grass.“It blocks access to the soil beneath for burrowing insects, such as solitary bees, and the ground above for soil dwellers such as worms, which will be starved of food beneath it,” he says. “It provides food for absolutely no living creatures.”It is not just wildlife that artificial turf affects. The Committee on Climate Change recommends rewilding a huge area of UK land and growing many more trees to help tackle global heating by storing carbon. Not only does fake grass have no climate benefits, but producing the plastic emits carbon and uses fossil fuels.The common practice of replacing soil with sand to provide a more stable bed for the fake grass also releases even more CO2 stored in the earth, according to David Elliott, chief executive of tree-planting charity Trees for Cities.There is also the matter of microplastics: the tiny particles of plastic that have made their way throughout the globe, and are present in our food, water and even the air.Evergreen UK’s turf is made mainly of polyethylene, with polypropylene and polyamide for some purposes. Driver claims the microplastics problem does not affect the artificial grass industry because it doesn’t sell single-use products. “Our products don’t degrade, we’ve always not had it as an issue, basically.” He adds that products from legitimate firms conform to standards set by the industry.Madeleine Berg, project manager at the environmental charity Fidra, counters that most plastics are likely to contribute to microplastics through physical and chemical degradation, such as being stepped on and exposed to constant sunlight. “You would be hard-pressed to say that you have created a product which doesn’t shed anything,” says Berg.There are also growing concerns about the impact of the synthetic chemicals that are added to artificial grass on human health and the environment. The EU has been investigating specialist artificial turf used on sports fields for suspected carcinogens, and is considering banning intentionally added microplastics. While these are different products to those sold to home gardeners, Berg says artificial pitches are sometimes reused for landscaping.And what happens to fake grass when it reaches the end of its life in 10-20 years?Unlike Royal Grass, Evergreens UK doesn’t market itself as eco-friendly, a term Driver calls “a little bit misleading”, but he is keen to stress that his company’s products can be recycled. However, this can only be done at specialist plants in Europe and it is doubtful that many customers would go the extra mile.Barter concedes that the root of the problem is social pressure for a perfect green lawn.“In the mindset of the British public you haven’t really got a garden unless you’ve got a lawn,” he says. “And I think a lot of people are put off by lawns because there’s so much quite confusing technical speak around it like mowing, feeding, weeding, moss control and overseeding. A lot of people just aren’t interested – they don’t have time in their busy lives.”There are some environmental benefits to using artificial grass. Unlike a real lawn, fake grass doesn’t need to be mowed – which some people do with electric or fossil fuel mowers – or watered, which is a serious consideration as the UK anticipates increasing water stress due to the climate crisis.Nor does it require fertilisers or herbicides, some of which have been subject to huge controversy, to achieve a uniform look.But lawns can also be maintained without those negative practices and products, and the soil loss problem is real: the RHS’ Greening Grey Britain survey has found a threefold rise in the number of front gardens that have been paved over.Barter also challenges the idea that artificial turf is maintenance-free, saying it still needs to be cleaned of litter and moss growth, and some owners have simply replaced mowing with vacuuming.“There are better solutions that would give people more pleasure than just looking out at this sheet of slowly degrading plastic,” he says.He suggests planting shady front gardens with tolerant shrubs, such as evergreen bushes: these provide greenery all year round, need little maintenance, suppress weeds, offer food for wildlife and places for birds to nest, and give hedgehogs and frogs cover to travel safely in urban streets. “After all, we are supposed to be a nation of gardeners.”To Trevor Dines, botanical specialist for charity Plantlife, the popularity of artificial grass shows how disconnected we have become from the natural world. “Whenever I see artificial grass my heart sinks – more nature smothered by more plastic. Where once we were famed for our lawns, we now opt for artificial, low-maintenance solutions.“This is not just to the detriment of wildlife but to us, too children can’t make a daisy-chain on a plastic lawn.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a3cb43032f8eee5b54fb0b24b4193dfa7cc3b09/0_195_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c78332aa38d7fd90f272e41738b2c9c3","title":"roaming cafes and pirate boats readers favourite floating traders","story":"We asked you to recommend canal boat shops, and you did not disappointFrom home brew kits to pirate-themed gifts, when we asked for your favourite canal boat shops, you certainly gave us variety. Lisa Ashwood told us about a floating sweetshop that she was thrilled to discover near the end of a long, tiring run from Buxton to her home village. “We were all flagging and the sudden discovery of a sweetshop canal boat was just too exciting,” she says.Few things symbolise the way our cities have transformed more than canals. Around the world, cities have woken up to the power of their urban waterways: from Milan to Manchester, the former economic arteries of industry are being turned into corridors for walkers, boaters and wildlife. Cafes and restaurants are proliferating and canalside living is newly chic – and newly costly.\u0026nbspAs commercial interests muscle in on the last great undeveloped bit of Britain’s cities,  Cities and the Observer wanted to take stock of a crucial moment in history, when we still have a choice: whether to turn canals into sanitised enclaves of wealth, or preserve them as a precious resource for all.Kevin Hall told us about a boat that sells Staffordshire oatcakes filled with cheese and bacon, which is often moored near Stoke City’s Bet365 football stadium on match days. And several of you got in touch with glowing endorsements of Sam Skinner’s floating bike repair service (a photo of which we included in our original callout). Here are a selection of your responses:“My favourite boat traders are without doubt the Home Brew Boat. They sell all sorts of home brew equipment and are responsible for getting my husband into home brewing. They continuously cruise, mainly in the north-west and Midlands but have a thriving mail order part to their business and Barry is always happy to answer questions or have his expertise tapped.“We love it when we are in their vicinity. Barry and Sandra are such engaging and enthusiastic proprietors that passing the time of day with them is always enjoyable and often leads to us buying yet more home brew stuff. When our supplies run low and we are not nearby we make use of mail order. As a sideline they sell Barry’s greetings cards which are printed with fabulous photos he’s taken (he was a professional photographer for 30 years before taking to the canals).” Helen Tidy, Aldridge“Cake on the Cut is run by Sam Keay on a narrowboat called Squox and Botter. Not only is it a fantastic cafe boat selling lots of yummy cakes and treats, she makes and sells Gangplank Spirits and Preserves which are produced with foraged fruit and herbs. Super tasty! A friendly trader with a very unusual paint job on her narrowboat – both sides are different and depict scenes of nature. She always sets up her roaming cafe with lots of cute tables, chairs, flowers and sometimes hammocks.” Katie lives on a narrowboat in Hertfordshire“The Pirate Boat sells various items, which all have a pirate theme. The last time we visited it was also selling ice cream and hot drinks. My kids absolutely love visiting this boat – the owner is a real character, she dresses like a pirate and interacts with everyone. My little boy was ecstatic when she handed him an inflatable sword and proceeded to have a play sword fight with him.” Anonymous“My favourite narrowboat is based on the Upper Peak Forest canal (and seen on the Macclesfield canal and also the Middlewich to Macclesfield stretch of the Trent and Mersey canal). The boat is called Andechs and an online music school is run from on board. They offer a huge range of live online instrumental music lessons provided by their music teachers who are based all over the world. I love the idea of their use of the latest technology from what was once the latest technology over 200 years ago, when the canals were built for very different commercial use.” Richard Foster, New Mills, Derbyshire“Hekla was in Watford last week, Mile End market this week, and who knows where next week. They’re a very nice couple selling very nice pictures and a very good book all round the network. They embody the spirit of the canals, using the system as it should be, travelling round making and selling stuff, with a friendly face taking your money off you.” John Williamson“Colin and Carole Warring from the Wool Boat sell commercial and indie yarn and dyed yarn, and are generally all round good eggs. In a pretty competitive market they endeavour to bring people together. Their boat reaches people who knit in far-flung communities and they champion English wool.” Cathy Wright, Ormskirk“Floating repairs is a mystical mechanical trip of bicycle bliss with long-legged Sammy making frames soldered in heaven. Makes a good cuppa too while you’re waiting for your ride to be repaired.” Imogen“The Oakcake boat is on the Trent and Mersey canal, opposite a local wildlife area known as Westport Lake. It serves fabulous Staffordshire oatcakes filled with cheese and bacon, plus tea and coffee. This place is a local institution and is very popular along this stretch of the canal. Also moors near Stoke City’s Bet365 stadium on match days. It serves the best oatcakes, our local delicacy that resembles a pancake but is made with oatmeal and is savoury rather than sweet.

But a no-deal Brexit would be an entirely political one. Boris Johnson’s blustering openness to no-deal derives from many things. Partly it stems from the fact that, to the keenest leavers, Brexit has always been an article of belief rather a policy programme. Partly it derives from the fear that only a decisive break will puncture the threat from the nationalist Brexit party. Partly it follows from the fact that he and many like him do not ultimately care about the Northern Ireland peace process, and are not bothered about the concerns of the devolved nations either. In the end, however, a no-deal Brexit is an act of faith-based politics and not a rational choice.It would also have very serious and perhaps destructive economic consequences. Some of those are becoming clearer by the day in response to the Johnson government’s prioritisation of politics. The most instantly destabilising is the fall in the value of the pound, which has dropped from $1.26 a month ago to just above $1.20 on Thursday. This puts the exchange rate within a whisker of the lowest for two and a half years and in sight of the depth to which it plunged just after the Brexit vote. But this is not a controlled devaluation. It is a freefall one. It benefits other economies without empowering ours. If a Labour government was doing this, it would be crucified for its incompetence.Even more disturbing is the decline in business investment. No-deal Brexit preparations are not the sole reason for capital’s institutional caution. International trade disputes and downturns also feed into an uncertain atmosphere. But the no-deal possibility does nothing except reinforce the mood. The result is a downward spiral of deferred decisions, stockpiled goods, declining output and avoidance of research outlay and product development. Output has fallen for the first time since the financial crisis, says the CBI. The car industry, still a major UK employer, has been particularly hard hit. Vauxhall this week said it may close its Ellesmere Port plant. BMW’s warnings show that a similar move may be imminent at Cowley.Unsurprisingly, the Bank of England said on Thursday that the risk of recession is growing, even before an actual no-deal takes place. The UK has already pencilled in zero growth in the second quarter. It would be a surprise if the third showed a better result. On the Bank’s estimates, 2019 will show the weakest UK growth since 2009 – even with EU membership – and it will be declining by the start of 2020. The Bank continues to stick to the official government message that a smooth Brexit deal is still expected. But even it acknowledges that with no-deal, the exchange rate will weaken further, inflation will rise and growth will slow even more for at least the next year.A rational policymaker would therefore be seeking ways of avoiding no-deal rather than feeding expectations that it will happen. The Johnson government, though, has ramped up the rhetoric and pumped in another £2.1bn in public money, not least on its own propaganda. Some of its commitments – like the pledge to buy UK lamb to protect hill-farmers – seem to have been made up on the spur of the moment. Others, like the disgraceful relabelling of the Irish backstop as anti-democratic, when it is not, are lies designed to mislead the public. For a government to say it does not want something to happen because it would be so damaging and then to spend so much of its money and its political capital on the possibility that it will is a shameful strategy. Nothing matters more in British politics right now than that MPs use every weapon to prevent a no-deal exit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d09b6dcf8564b2374a33e7e3d9cf28f6eca5d27/0_97_4287_2572/master/4287.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3de4aa4fc67ff7d29830e82dc7db4921","title":"britain local councils public services","story":"For years, councils have been starved of resources. The resulting crisis in public services is matched by a crisis of democracySome people think Britain’s greatest challenge is the impending Brexit. They are wrong. Britain’s greatest challenge is the impending collapse in its local public services. I recently travelled to cities in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. The contrast to Britain was stark. Of course surface impressions can be deceptive, but I was struck by the absence of piles of litter, potholed streets, screaming police cars, tacky ads on roundabouts and graffiti. There were also fewer desperate people pleading for money. I felt I was briefly in a civilised continent. The difference is that in continental Europe, these matters are at the discretion of local people, the mayor and electors. As they get richer, they reasonably expect, vote for and pay locally for better services. In Britain they are not allowed to do this. So they get worse.Over the “austerity” decade since 2010, British government has stripped localities of a great chunk of their centrally supplied resources. What is left is spent on statutory services such as social care, schools and roads. Local government has become an instrument of the centre. Money has steadily dried up for discretionary activities, such as youth clubs, old people’s homes, children’s agencies, drug treatment centres, homeless shelters, libraries, cleaner streets and public gardens. Successive chancellors have treated impoverished councils’ pleas with contempt and cavalier disregard.One indication of this is the hierarchy that exists between the services for which Westminster has responsibility, and those few over which councils still have some discretion. The former cater for the haves, the latter for the have-nots.Care of elderly people is the pride of any prospering community. Effective lobbying by the NHS means our hospital system is relatively well-financed, though costs rise year by year. But the domestic care of old people, much of which falls under the purview of local authorities, is sliding towards catastrophe. Four hundred care homes have closed in five years. The sector’s £1bn deficit will rise a further £700m as a result of this year’s round of cuts. Norfolk alone is slashing £9m from its adult services budget. This will inevitably overcrowd NHS hospital wards, but Whitehall will not mind. Hospitals are its empire and the Treasury always bails them out. Care homes can go bankrupt.Likewise, the nation’s defence plans are a stranger to budgetary discipline. Eager ministers sounding the alarm over “security threats” are furnished with glamorous kit and headline interventions galore. The defence of the public goods of local communities is far too mundane a goal to attract such largesse. Instead of ships, these places can only point to overcrowded prisons. Security threats at local level amount to a vicious circle of broken families, school exclusions, drug addiction, gang membership, county lines and knife fights. Forget about Boris Johnson’s 20,000 more police as the true frontline of defending local communities. The strategy should be focused on the intensive counselling of vulnerable teenagers through out-of-hours schooling, youth clubs and prison rehabilitation. Yet these local services are closing in droves: 81 London youth clubs have shut their doors in the past eight years. Camden’s spending on them has fallen from £3.2m in 2011 to £2.4m, Westminster’s from £1.5m to almost nothing. Our civic defences are in headlong retreat.These kinds of services cannot be “nationalised”. They respond to local concerns, local pride and local resources. Centralising, standardising and cutting merely demoralise staff and weaken leadership. Small wonder “good people” no longer want to serve.Yet Glasgow’s recent breakthrough in street crime was a telltale sign of what can happen when a devolved government is freed from Whitehall. It renews and succeeds. The failings noted in Rotherham, Northampton and Nottingham were those of people deprived, year after year, of room to innovate and improve. Theirs was just a grim round of cut, cut and cut. For 30 years, no British government has reversed Margaret Thatcher’s local capping of property tax. When central resources were rising it did not matter. Now a centralising state, described by the LSE’s Tony Travers as “without precedent in modern times”, is crippling the welfare state at the frontline. Revenues from local taxes have halved since capping. If people want better services locally, in a democracy they should be allowed to vote for them. A liberty enjoyed by citizens across Europe is denied to Britons.There is only one obstacle. It is the political arrogance of a Westminster culture that cannot bear power residing anywhere but in its own hands. MPs accuse Brussels of power-grabbing. They are fine ones to talk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e72b17f7ffc9a48a337f7b17f2bfe3f8217766b/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=491515f258859f57d388358e6266f9d9","title":"british no deal brexit irish peace unity","story":"The British rush to a no-deal Brexit puts Irish unity urgently back on the agenda. We risk repeating historyIn The Ultras, the brutal, brilliant novel by Eoin McNamee set during the Troubles, the protagonist (based on the real-life undercover British intelligence officer Robert Nairac) finds himself in the company of dangerous men like himself. The Ultras plot terrible events and create dark polities while forcing everyone else to live with their consequences. “Ultra meaning beyond,” wrote McNamee. “Ultra meaning extreme.”The so-called war cabinet formed by the new British prime minister, Boris Johnson, and whose course the maverick arch-Brexiteer Dominic Cummings now charts, of course bears no resemblance to the characters in the war of the Ultras imagined by McNamee. But the sheer velocity and ferocity of their opening salvoes about crashing out of the EU with no deal on October 31 unless the backstop – the insurance policy to avoid a hard border in Ireland – is abolished, raise the kind of alarm that we in Ireland have not felt since the dark years of the Troubles.The political fear is that this new breed of “Brexit Ultras” (Johnson’s cabinet with Nigel Farage’s Brexit party snapping at its heels) could deliberately pursue a no-deal EU exit at the expense of a volatile Irish peace.The sabre-rattling and pre-emptive blame-shifting of course is intended to shore up political support in the UK ahead of a possible general election, but also to intimidate Ireland into abandoning the backstop while shaking the unity of the EU27. Europe, with its own demons to face, has its red lines too and will not sacrifice the single market or its external borders, or jeopardise the wider integrity of the European project. Ireland, and the fragile peace process that has been built over the past 20 years, falls between these two positions.And while it is still early days for the Johnson premiership, we have a deteriorated state of Anglo-Irish relations following his ascent to power. How real is the damaging rhetoric emanating from London and the anti-Irish tropes spewing from much of the British media? David Yelland, the former editor of the Sun, revealed that he had been shocked when “Tories of influence” told him privately that Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s taoiseach “isn’t bright” and “the Irish will blink”. “It seems, amazingly, that this is the actual policy of HMG under Johnson,” tweeted Yelland. “They are anti-Irish, arrogant, dangerous and wrong.”That relations between London and Dublin are now strained is beyond dispute, though officials in Dublin insist that much of the noise is to be expected and aimed at a domestic UK audience rather than Ireland or the EU.Still, following his appointment, it took almost a week for Johnson to place a phone call with Varadkar, who leads a confidence-and-supply coalition that – while shaky on a series of domestic issues – serves as a national government in all but name for the purposes of Brexit. When the phone call did proceed, both men adopted an uncompromising stance: Johnson insisting the removal of the backstop is a precondition for any deal, Varadkar adamant that the EU will not relent on the withdrawal agreement.Varadkar rightly reminded Johnson of the British government’s obligation – as a co-signatory of the Good Friday agreement – to exercise its power in respect of Northern Ireland with rigorous impartiality. Johnson’s government relies, for the time being, on the support in the Commons of the Democratic Unionist party to prop up its narrow majority. The difficult parliamentary arithmetic, combined with Johnson’s inflammatory rhetoric, represents a serious challenge to the UK’s obligation to act as an honest broker in respect of Northern Ireland – the majority of whose citizens voted, like their Scottish brethren, to stay in the EU.And although unionists are being comforted, for now, by Johnson, their confidence that a hard Brexit will not give birth to a united Ireland must also be fraying at the seams. This is not least because nearly two-thirds of the Tory party indicate in polling that they would rather sacrifice the union – and see Northern Ireland and Scotland leave it – than abandon Brexit.Johnson (just like his predecessors) has yet to offer any meaningful alternatives to the backstop, yet blindly insists, as a pre-condition to talks with Brussels, that it must be removed. Given such a hardline starting point, what compromises would a deal with Brussels before October 31 entail? The recent ITV interview with the foreign secretary Dominic Raab on the issue of what flexibility the UK government has shown to date does not augur well for what lies ahead.The high-handed, perhaps not entirely unexpected tone of the hard Brexiteers, including Johnson, has undoubtedly reawakened bad memories in Ireland. Nobody on the island is blind to the reality that in standing by the backstop in order to avoid a hard border, they could end up with one if the UK crashes out without a deal. Indeed, the Irish government has conceded, in its latest updated contingency action plan, that it will implement increased checks and procedures in the event of a no-deal Brexit. That means border infrastructure and checkpoints that, however they are named and wherever they are, will have social and economic consequences both foreseen and unforeseen.One of those consequences is the possibility of a united Ireland – a prospect that terrifies me if the process of getting there is not given the time and breadth it needs, and if that existential, constitutional question it is not curated with the utmost inclusiveness and sensitivity.Last week Varadkar stated the obvious when he told the MacGill summer school that a hard Brexit would force communities in Northern Ireland to consider the possibility of a united Ireland. They already are. What was once an entirely fringe aspiration for nationalists, and a dreaded fear for unionists – each side comforted by the thought that the conversation about unification was decades away – has become an urgent debate for all.Contrary to anti-Irish tropes that the backstop is a Trojan horse in order to secure a united Ireland, the truth is that both communities in Northern Ireland – as well as citizens across the island of Ireland – are fearful of what a botched, rushed conversation about unification might yield. That fear is that the birth of a united Ireland would be accompanied by violence and upheaval.Unification without the support of unionists, whose traditions and identity must be protected as part of any shared future, cannot be pursued as a zero-sum game. Otherwise we risk repeating history: the Troubles in reverse. Northern Ireland could not, in its current perilous state, survive either a hard Brexit or a united Ireland. Its communities are suspended in an in-between space, in which they have enjoyed 21 years without violence but have not yet progressed to a positive peace or meaningful integration – a process that takes time and effort to heal wounds.What many people in the UK forget or are indifferent to is the fact that, for all the successes of the Good Friday agreement – a vital edifice that allows us to identify as British, Irish or both – peace is not fully won.That is why all the trash talk is so damaging, and why we need to pull back from the rhetorical brink. That is what is lost in this war of the Ultras: that the price of political power could be the unforgiveable loss of peace.• Dearbhail McDonald is an Irish commentator and the author of Bust"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28146e8e0ef6066ec484fc4c02f50801d33c977b/0_180_8417_5048/master/8417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb2d55368f553c13c29bcf9979dbe111","title":"everything is better without alcohol and i really do mean everything reader relationships with drinking","story":"After Gay Alcorn wrote about giving up alcohol for a month readers responded with their own tales of struggle, indulgence and enjoymentThis week Gay Alcorn wrote about giving up alcohol for a month and how she was not prepared for the impact it had. She wrote:I drank to pretend that my life was more interesting than it was, to escape from everyday problems, and because I enjoyed it. Or maybe that’s self-justifying crap. Maybe it’s just that alcohol is an addictive substance like all of those illicit drugs we demonise and, over the years, I had become addicted.The piece had an extraordinary response with hundreds of thousands of people reading. Below is an edited selection of readers’ comments:Good for you. As someone who did have a drink problem, I personally think the line between an alcoholic and a normal drinker is blurred. Millions of these supposed normal drinkers are addicted to alcohol – a foul-tasting drug that makes you behave badly and feel wretched. Don’t drink again and don’t feel like you’re giving anything up: you’re not.When I came to work in the Middle East six years ago, I took a conscious decision that living in a country where alcohol was illegal and trying to hold down a pretty challenging job would mean my avoiding booze completely. Once taken, the decision proved quite easy – it was as simple as changing gears. I was quite surprised, however, to find that the chief effect was not physical as much as it was mental – the depression and violent outbursts which had haunted me for decades gradually ebbed away. It took a while to realise that alcohol had been the equivalent of the Old Man of the Sea for most of my adult life.Best wishes, Gay. I stopped drinking two and a half years ago and with the benefit of distance, I can now say these things are true:1. Alcohol made me feel good only in that it satisfied the craving for alcohol. Now the craving is gone (give it three months) I don’t need alcohol to unwind. In fact, I’m much less wound.2. Everything is better without alcohol, and I really do mean everything.By the way, the most I drank in a session was three drinks. Mainly it was one or two. And I drank four to five times a week. So pretty normal by most standards. And I was addicted. I can see that now.Like the writer, my one or two glasses of wine with the evening meal crept up to three or four and some days I drank half a bottle or even whole bottle of wine. For about a year I had a background worry that I was addicted. Then I decided I needed to lose weight, and to be successful this time, I would stop drinking alcohol completely. So one day I just stopped. And for three months drank no alcohol apart from one night at a dinner party. Pleased to discover it was easy, I felt a lot better, and I was more productive and positive. And I was also happy to discover that I did not have an addiction, it had just been a habit. I just had a three week holiday where I had one or two beers most days. Now I am back at work and alcohol-free again. Highly recommend it. May not be quite so easy if you do have an addiction issue, which I did not seem to have.I am not joking, I never had a drink problem, I just drank too much. I drink all the time, now it is alcohol free beer. I never keep count. What jolted me into my senses was the day I drank four bottles of red and was still functional. I realised how much I was drinking and just gave up. I have never missed it. I had one drink out of curiosity, it was a non event. Hence I am not sure the addictive aspect is universal, I was definitely addicted to smoking.Gave up proper drinking two years ago. I had slowly developed a bad habit of drinking every night, sometimes half a bottle, sometimes a whole bottle. I thought feeling vaguely shit until lunchtime was normal. The first thing I noticed a few weeks in is how happy I felt all the time. Just content and relaxed. I realised this was my old normal, it was like going back to being a child. It’s changed my life immeasurably for the better, I’ve gotten right into exercise and my fitness levels are fantastic for my age. I found after about eight months I can have the occasional drink at weddings etc with no problem, it doesn’t trigger me wanting to continue. I know this is not the case for everyone.I have been trying to stop bingeing on booze for 30 years. Can’t do it. I stay sober for a month – no worries – feel great. Then for any reason or no reason I get totally tanked for three days until I’m so ill sometimes I end up in hospital. At 14 I started on Muscat Marsala and Milk. euw! I could easily blend in to Russia because vodka is awesome. My guilt hits me when I play guitar and sing in Church. I am a hypocrite.I’m a rural Irish single person who hasn’t had a drink for about fifteen years, and I must admit that it’s led to me having a very solitary life, but I’m almost never in trouble, and I used to always be. Well worth it.A drink, even just one drink, gave me a burst of instant ambition, followed by a rather anticlimactic 9pm procrastination slump once the kids were in bed, consisting of watching dumb YouTube clips about how evil Trump is, or some dissatisfying Netflix crap, until I couldn’t keep my eyes open and crawled into bed at 12.30.Now I understand that what I craved was actually the mouth feel, more than the alcohol. I’ve replaced alcohol with super fizzy water and everything is better. In fact since then I’ve not only been offered an amazing new job but I’ve also learned the first couple of pages of Brahms’ Intermezzo opus 118 number 2 in A major (which you should all go and listen to Glenn Gould playing on YouTube because it is life alteringly beautiful).I used to have a booze-free month every year. I stopped doing it because I had to accept that those months were invariably the most joyless, miserable, depressing, empty months of the year. I am not joking, but I realise this experience does not sit well with this newspaper’s tireless and tedious crusade against alcohol.I’ve avoided alcohol all my life. Meaning, I might have one glass of wine, or half a pint of beer, two or three times a year, in a particular situation. But that’s it. The reason? I’m mean on giving away bits of my life, my energy, my alertness, my “being present”, as this writer puts it, being fully aware.The way she describes here hangovers – to me, that reads like feeling a bit ill. Feeling a bit ill every day. Feeling a bit low, a bit slow, a bit headachy, a bit foggy. Every bloody day. Like feeling you’re about to come down with a cold every day.To me, it’s like giving up bits of your life, your consciousness, your aliveness, your alertness. If I didn’t feel I had an interesting life, with things to do, then I suppose it would matter less if I wasted some of it semi-aware, through drink. But I do have an interesting life, in all sorts of ways, so many things in which to take interest and pleasure. Were I to be drunk, or even tipsy, or even hungover, I could absolutely not be fully engaged in the moment, take real pleasure, be absorbed, experience things properly. I need all my faculties, all my senses, all my emotional alertness, to really experience being alive.Well, that’s me, whether that sounds wanky or not. I want every second. I want every inch of my life, all that I can have, fully known, fully experienced, none of it chucked away.That middle class drinking wine at home every night is completely pointless and utterly dull.I’ve overdone the grog for the most part but it’s been largely the adventure of frothies in pubs, meeting people, women, the odd argument. But it served a purpose, I couldn’t ever imagine just quaffing wine at home as some daily ritual."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afdc587c57d14c4e502554eeb6885421d458a93c/0_0_1690_1014/master/1690.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1a15cdf39dbdd45928c754cfa9cdf70","title":"if you act now you can maybe avoid the worst of climate change but you know youre not going to","story":"The rage inducing, sober reality of it, you could do it but you won’t"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91c8f41f69dc1c3b7ebce32287d32f3ff5172130/0_164_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d386475f801dec9c2a04fd9d5a19af97","title":"bearded vultures soar again in alps after breeding scheme","story":"Record 35 chicks expected to leave nests this year in successful wildlife comebackThis summer, as the snows finally melt across the Alps, a record 35 bearded vulture chicks are expected to leave their nests and take to the skies to patrol their mountain home, in one of the most successful wildlife comebacks of recent times.“Bearded vultures were hunted to extinction in the Alps in the early 20th century. People referred to them as the devil bird believing that they would carry off small children and sheep,” said Théo Mazet, who works for Asters, a French wildlife organisation helping to bring the birds back to the Alps.But attitudes have changed and the vultures have made a dramatic return, albeit with a helping hand.“A captive breeding and reintroduction project began in the late 1980s and there are now a total of 250 birds, including 50 breeding pairs of bearded vultures in the Alps,” said Mazet.Mazet works at a specialist captive breeding centre in a secluded forest high above the alpine town of Sallanches, one of five centres in the mountain range.Here Mazet prepares food for the seven vultures housed in the centre’s massive aviary. He carefully weighs chunks of freshly butchered sheeps’ and goats’ legs for the birds – the only avian species to live on a diet of animal bones.“Bearded vultures are scavengers and act as the rubbish collectors of the natural world which helps to eliminate potentially harmful bacteria and the spread of diseases, so keeping the mountain environment healthy,” he said.Key to the project’s success has been the 100 captive vultures held in the breeding centres throughout Europe, which in turn are providing birds to be returned to the wild.José Tavares, the director of the Vulture Conservation Foundation, which is spearheading the reintroduction of the bearded vulture across Europe, explains that they only use birds that have been bred in captivity rather than capturing and relocating birds from elsewhere.The project has so far cost tens of millions of euros – so why spend so much money and effort on the reintroduction of one species?“The bearded vulture is an umbrella species so that the work we do in improving the mountain habitat for the bearded vulture benefits other mountain wildlife too, such as black grouse, golden eagles and ibex,” said Tavares.He believes the reintroduction project is helping other wider conservation and rewilding goals. “Bearded vultures are scavengers, they’re not predators, so they won’t kill cattle or game species such as chamois, so uniquely there are relatively few conflicts with people – unlike wolves or bears which are far more controversial,” he said.“Because bearded vultures are a neutral species, everyone works with you – so for example, we’ve been able to talk about banning the use of lead bullets with hunters. If we’d been working with wolves we wouldn’t even be able to sit in the same room as the hunters.”The Alps, Europe’s biggest mountain range, have undergone intensive development in recent years from both the ski and hydroelectric power industries. The result is that one of the main threats facing bearded vultures is collisions with ski lift cables and power lines – accidents that kill one or two birds every year.“We are working closely with ski resorts and power companies to fit visual deterrents on their cables to reduce this problem,” said Tavares.Tavares is upbeat about the bird’s future and its value to the region. He says he realised its potential after the response of locals to the first reintroductions: “When I saw the enthusiasm of the local stakeholders when we released our first bearded vulture back into the Alps, I instantly realised that we had something very powerful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f86198d979e6f8f75e8452f5998bae41143ed63/0_116_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a7b099e962cb2b39683e5dd6b77e53e","title":"heatwaves amplify near record levels of ice melt in northern hemisphere","story":"Greenland’s ice sheet shrunk more in past month than in average year, experts warnThe frozen extremities of the northern hemisphere are melting at a near-record rate as heatwaves buffet the Arctic, forest fires tear through Siberia and glaciers retreat on Greenland fjords and Alpine peaks.Unusually high temperatures are eating into ice sheets that used to be solid throughout the year, according to glaciologists, who warn this is both an amplifying cause and effect of man-made climate disruption across the globe.Greenland – which is home to the world’s second biggest ice sheet – is likely to have shrunk more in the past month than the average for a whole year between 2002 and now, according to provisional estimates from satellite data. Surface ice declined in July by 197 gigatonnes, equivalent to about 80m Olympic swimming pools, according to Ruth Mottram of the Danish Meteorological Institute. An additional third of that amount is likely to have been lost from glaciers and icebergs.With more than a month of the melt season to go, 2019 is already one of the top 10 years for ice loss in Greenland. The extent is thought unlikely to beat the record in 2012, but Luke Trusel, an assistant professor of geography at Penn State university, said the strength of the melt was greater.Temperatures have been 10C or more above normal this week. Even at the summit of the ice sheet – which is 3,200 metres above sea level – there were 10 hours at or above freezing temperatures yesterday, which is extremely rare, he said. More broadly, ice core analysis has shown that the runoff is at levels expected only once every century, possibly even every millennium.“What was highly unusual in the recent past is becoming the new normal. The Arctic is far more sensitive to warming now than even a few decades ago,” Trusel said.The impact on sea level has not yet been calculated, but the high temperatures are likely to accelerate the calving of the giant Petermann glacier, where at least two huge cracks have been identified in recent years. Giant chunks of ice – each several kilometres in length – are expected to collapse into the ocean in the next few years.The Russian government has belatedly declared a state of emergency in four Siberian regions and reportedly sent troops to help extinguish forest fires that have ripped across an area the size of Belgium.This follows record-high temperatures in several locations. Last weekend, Norway registered its joint hottest day ever. More than 20 areas in the north of the country have recently experienced “tropical nights”, with temperatures above 20C from dusk until dawn.In the Canadian Arctic, which is warming two times faster than the global average, locals have suffered record wildfires, and permafrost is melting decades ahead of predictions. Last month, the far northern community of Alert, Nunavut, registered a record-high of 21C, which a local meteorologist said it had never been seen that close to the pole.European mountains have been affected too. Authorities have warned that the slopes below the Matterhorn’s 4,480-metre peak are increasingly prone to avalanches and landslides because the ice-core is warming. High-altitude lakes of meltwater have also been reported in the Mont Blanc mountain range in France.In Switzerland, the threat to alpine glaciers has been so alarming that more regions are using giant fleece blankets to try to insulate the ice from the hot air. Even so, the country’s glaciers lost about 0.8bn tons of snow and ice during the two recent heatwaves, according to glaciologist Matthias Huss.“Absolutely exceptional for a period of only 14 days in total!” Huss said on Twitter. “And the summer is not yet over.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/516f42b350eedd8eba218f5477f7df71228c8ff0/0_109_2747_1648/master/2747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0c507344e5901c40fe8c1932ce284b1","title":"do the right thing review spike lee","story":"Racial tensions hit boiling point on the Brooklyn streets in a masterwork whose relevance remains starker than everFive years ago, for the film’s 25th anniversary, Spike Lee threw a big party with a special video message from Barack and Michelle Obama, who had gone to see Do the Right Thing on their first date. Now it is getting a UK re-release in honour of its 30th – and the context is very different. The implied happy ending of the Obama era has been unceremoniously amputated and we are back with the moods of anger and uncertainty that drove the film in the first place. When careworn pizzeria proprietor Sal (Danny Aiello) says he is thinking of quitting and turning his place into a condominium called Trump’s Pizza or Trump’s Plaza, the dialogue lands with a slap. (Although it is easy for Brit critics to get overexcited about eerily prophetic references to Donald Trump in movies from the 80s and 90s, not quite appreciating how ubiquitous he has been in American popular culture for the last 30 years.)Do the Right Thing has plenty more material that is absolutely relevant right now. “If this hot weather continues, it’s going to melt the polar ice caps and the whole wide world,” says one of the three idle guys hanging out opposite Sal’s. In 1989, the line was a metaphor for disaster in the social climate. And of course the ending, with a black man killed in a police chokehold, could have been filmed at any time since 1989.It’s an unbearably hot day in New York, the background music being provided by DJ Mister Señor Love Daddy, played by the young Samuel L Jackson. Lee himself plays Mookie, a pizza delivery guy for Sal’s Famous Pizzeria in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, which Lee shows in the first stages of white gentrification. His girlfriend Tina (Rosie Perez) rules the movie by virtue of her explosive dance sequence over the opening credits, to Public Enemy’s Fight the Power. Sal is the middle-aged restaurant owner, who employs his two shiftless sons and is at once wary of his predominantly black clientele and sentimental about having “fed” them all since their childhood. He is also gallantly and tragically in love with Mookie’s sister Jade (Joie Lee), to the intense embarrassment and chagrin everyone else.Mookie is reasonably friendly with Sal’s younger son Vito (Richard Edson) but in a permanently hostile state with the elder son Pino (a lean, livewire John Turturro), who is angry, depressed and very racist. As the temperature climbs, so do the racial tensions, and things reach boiling point when Mookie’s friend Buggin’ Out (Giancarlo Esposito) looks at Sal’s black-and-white photographs of Frank Sinatra, Joe DiMaggio, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro and demands to know why there aren’t any “brothers on the wall”. That argument is Lee’s masterstroke: it’s a culture war, a war about representation that could have come straight from a social media exchange in 2019. Buggin’ Out suggests, to Sal’s astonishment, that because African-Americans form virtually all his customer base, they have a democratic right to at least one black American on his wall. Sal is not ready for a new political world, whose dawn Lee sketches out here, in which it is not enough simply to refrain from making overtly racist gestures: omission or erasure is equally insulting.White people are at war with black people, who are in turn at war with Latinos, but Lee extends to each faction a vibrant pop-culture identity. Where he is less complimentary is to the Koreans who run the convenience store across from Sal’s. They are still an exoticised mystery, and in the riot scene it isn’t immediately clear if they will be protected from looting by virtue of ethnic underdog status or be considered de facto whites. (There hasn’t been much from Hollywood or indie cinema about the Korean experience in New York or Los Angeles – although Justin Chon’s 2017 film Gook is worth a look.)The film closes with contrasting statements from Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, one saying that violence is never justified and the other that it is in self-defence. Malcolm X effectively gets the last word. But just as affecting is the desolate peace process between Sal and Mookie as they debate how much back-pay Mookie is owed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffaa259b4f73d4891c1b5387717634c8b8015b90/0_114_2592_1555/master/2592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=753b77e51dcdc61f019f243f752efef3","title":"sequins eyeliner and loos how female friendships on screen got real","story":"Animals is the latest film to explore women’s lives in a refreshingly realistic way. Why did it take Fleabag and Girls for cinema to realise there is more to a narrative than marriage?When did you last see a film with a friendship between two women that felt real, a friendship that didn’t play second fiddle to romance in the narrative arc, that was not trampled over or cast aside in the quest for true love? Love stories about female friends are vanishingly rare. But this summer, Olivia Wilde’s gorgeous coming-of-age story Booksmart arrived on screen. Now comes Animals, the director Sophie Hyde’s hedonistic Irish comedy about two best friends, underemployed graduates in their early 30s working as coffee-shop baristas. Imagine the lads from Withnail and I played by Patsy and Edina from Ab Fab and you have a decent impression of hard-partying double-act Laura and Tyler.By night, you will find the pair – played by Holliday Grainger and Alia Shawkat – done up to the nines in charity shop sequins and green eyeliner, snorting, drinking and shagging their way around Dublin while quoting Yeats with grandiose theatrically. No man can keep them apart. When Tyler hooks up with a guy in a bar, she shoots Laura a saucy wink: “Give me eight minutes.” She is back in time for the next round.Laura and Tyler live together, share a bed and pee in front of each other (peering into the loo to inspect the results: “You need to drink more water”). Humour is the film’s greatest strength. There are funny and rude scenes that will make you splutter – one involving a pretentious poet stagily performing oral sex. However, the moments that stay with you are the serious ones tucked in among the laughs. When Tyler’s dad dies, she explains everything in a 15-second conversation. They have spent years psychoanalysing their families – there is no need to spell out how she is feeling.You may never have invited a friend to examine your urine, but you will almost certainly experience a jolt of recognition watching the friendship shorthand between these two – entire conversations spoken in a couple of glances, inside jokes that no one else can decipher. It is radical, rare and bracing to see female friendship portrayed so intimately. Often it feels as if these relationships are somehow not interesting or important enough to put on a cinema screen.On television, it is another story, with an explosion in recent series about womanhood that have explored the intense, meaningful, often nigglesome business of being a friend. Over six seasons of Lena Dunham’s Girls, Hannah’s college friends grew up and grew apart. Broad City observed how love and jobs come and go but, in her 20s, a girl’s best friend is everything. Fleabag circled the protagonist’s guilt at betraying her closest friend. Is cinema finally playing catch-up to this golden age of TV?Hyde tells me she agrees with the comparison to Girls, but points out that Animals is based on a novel by Emma Jane Unsworth (who also wrote the screenplay). “Our inspirations were drawn much more closely from our own lives,” she says. She also cites films such as Withnail and I and Lynne Ramsay’s Morvern Callar as big influences.Hyde says she wanted to make a film about the love between two friends. “I feel we’re told so many narratives about romance as if that’s the most important relationship in our life, and it is important. But why are friendships passed over as flippant or a stop-gap until you find the person you’re meant to be with? That’s not my experience. Friendships are so formative and they continue to be important through your life.” At Q\u0026ampAs after screenings of Animals, she is often asked to name her favourite films about female friendship. “It’s weird, but when you try and list them, there aren’t that many.”She has a point. There is no shortage of films about male friendship, so many that we have a vocabulary for them – buddy movies, bromances. But the history of cinema is not littered with films about female friendship. Sure, we can all name our favourites – The Women, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Girlfriends, 9 to 5, Thelma and Louise and Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion. But what is lacking is variety. So often what we are given is saccharine (Boys on the Side, Mystic Pizza, Fried Green Tomatoes) or girls behaving badly (Bridesmaids, Girls’ Night).Traditionally, Hollywood has had a major issue with close female friendships. Viewed through a male gaze, it has been jazzed up with a bit of psycho-bitchery or lesbianism. The early 90s gave us the outrageously unfeminist Single White Female (your flatmate loves you so much she kills your dog and rams a stiletto into your boyfriend’s eye) and The Hand that Rocks the Cradle (begins with a male sexual predator, but quickly turns into the story of a female homicidal maniac). You could position Killing Eve in this schlockily entertaining lineage – but, refreshingly, the erotic frisson between Eve and sociopathic assassin Villanelle has nothing to do with guys.Shelley Cobb, a film historian at the University of Southampton, points out that in Hollywood, friendship between women is usually “curtailed or contained by men” – inevitably relegated to a secondary relationship in the march to the happy-ever-after ending of marriage. “That’s why many female friendship films are set in the teenage years and 20s. In the end, the friendship always has to be subordinated to maturity, which usually is signalled by marriage, but also by motherhood, and sometimes the death of one of the friends that sets the others on to the path of adulthood.”Cobb adds: “Whether explicitly or not, female friendship is always seen as a threat to the patriarchy, and the structure of film plots and the insistent heterosexuality of Hollywood requires that the threat be contained. Usually marriage is the answer, because most female friendship films are set when women are single and fairly young.”Sticking two fingers up at the patriarchy, today’s writers are ditching love and marriage as their happy endings. Instead, the finishing line for their female protagonists is independence and a sense of identity from work.In Animals, Laura (Grainger) has been tinkering away at a novel for a decade and is getting panicky at the thought that her career as a writer is never going to happen. There is a love interest – two, in fact – but her real dilemma is ambition versus getting wasted every night. Greta Gerwig’s Frances Ha, a Woody Allen-ish love story about the ebb and flow of a female friendship, ends similarly – with work fulfilment not love. When I interviewed Gerwig a few years ago, she told me that she began writing scripts in frustration at the twentysomething female roles she was being offered: “They fall in love or they fall out of love. It’s like: Where are the films about female friendship or ambition?” Frances Ha fixed that, and Gerwig made her directing debut with Lady Bird, a teen movie in which the heroine’s really meaningful relationships are with women – her best friends and her mum.If you want to be picky about Animals, some of the hedonistic scenes feel a bit try-hard. But the joy of the film is that it doesn’t punish Laura or Tyler for their wild ways. In time, they may decide to grow up and become proper adults, but they regret nothing. Getting trashed is fun, and meaningless sex can be just that, meaningless. And here the film really does break new ground.Hyde proudly tells me about a comment from someone in an audience: “They said: ‘I just want to thank you for not killing one of the characters off, having them OD or step in front of a bus or something.” One of Hyde’s bugbears in films is the female character having a dramatic wake-up call. “You know, at the end of the film she takes a bottle of alcohol and tips it down the sink as if that’s cleaning up her life. That’s so black and white. The truth is we don’t all have this moment of revelation.”Does she have any offending films in mind? Hyde laughs. “I don’t know if I should say it, but I was super-excited when Trainwreck came out. Amy Schumer is so great. But it was exactly that moment. She tips out the booze and dresses like a cheerleader. And I just felt really unsatisfied by that idea that convention is the answer. It might be for some people, but it isn’t for me.”So, are the gatekeepers of cinema finally wising up to the audience demand for honest portrayals of women and their friendships? Animals premiered at Sundance in January to positive reviews, but has yet to find a US distributor. What is the problem, I ask. Is it the messy female characters, the sex, or the booze? Hyde laughs. “All of the above. I think it’s all those things. In the US, there was a bit of a question about the drinking, whether they were addicts, which is very American. And some people find the characters abrasive.”Bonnie-Chance Roberts, who is in her late 20s, is a co-producer on the forthcoming film of Caitlin Moran’s novel How to Build a Girl, starring Emma Thompson and Booksmart’s Beanie Feldstein. Does she agree that TV made by women of her generation is shaking up film industry attitudes to female stories? “Yes. There’s definitely been a change in the last few years. I think that’s also because of the #MeToo movement. People are tearing down walls.”She also believes there is more opportunity for women than ever before: “On the producing side, I feel there’s more space even between my generation and the generation of my bosses. There’s more space for women coming up and that affects the stories being told.” Her bosses are Alison Owen and Debra Hayward, who between them have producer credits on Suffragette, Bridget Jones’s Baby and Atonement.What is interesting when talking to Roberts is how much of Hollywood conventional wisdom she rejects. It is often taken as a given that men won’t go to see a movie with a female protagonist. That is not only outdated, but out of step with her experience, she says. “I have a 21-year-old brother and he went to see Booksmart because he wanted to see it. He didn’t think: ‘That’s a girl’s film.’ It’s changing, especially for younger generations.“How to Build a Girl is a coming-of-age comedy and we have a female protagonist. Obviously, that’s very important to the identity of the movie but it’s also not just a women’s film. It’s about learning and making mistakes. And figuring out who you are. You can’t identify it purely as a movie for women.”For Roberts, it is about seeing more women’s stories on screen. “We grew up identifying with the male identity, and there were many shades of that identity. There’s Ferris Bueller or Call Me By Your Name. These movies don’t just look at one part of masculinity. Whereas I think that, traditionally, women’s stories have been told through certain genres, a love story or a tragedy.”What can we expect as this supertalented generation of women creators get older and make content that reflects their experiences of their 40s, 50s and beyond? In Animals, Tyler jokes to Laura that they are destined to grow old together: “One day it’s just going to be me and you pissing in each other’s beds.” Yet there isn’t a model for friends living together – society doesn’t sanction wandering hand in hand into the sunset with your best friend. But you know never know. I can’t have been the only one to share with my friends the news story of a group of seven girlfriends in China clubbing together to buy their dream retirement home. So let’s hear it for Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Golden Girls."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aabcff95b0da20620ec523b5e75db3db23877c04/0_33_3052_1831/master/3052.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7ec898557978ee12b61b322947984c7","title":"moise kean premier league everton juventus italy","story":"The forward, who has shown his potential for Juventus and Italy, will hope more playing time can help him flourishMoise Kean has some very specific career objectives. “I dream of scoring in a Champions League final,” he once told the newspaper Tuttosport. “With my head. Against a team from Spain.”A move from Juventus to Everton would seem to take him further away from such ambitions. The Bianconeri have played in two of the past five Champions League finals, and signed Cristiano Ronaldo last summer precisely to help them conquer Europe. Everton have not played in the continent’s top club competition in almost half a century, barring a qualifying-round defeat by Villarreal in 2005.Sometimes, though, the most important thing is just to be out on the pitch. Kean played in 17 matches for Juventus last season, yet he started only six. Too few for a 19-year-old who contemplated quitting football altogether in his younger years, out of frustration at having his minutes restricted. His mother’s relentless work schedule meant he was always getting dropped off at his local team’s training sessions midway through.Both have been rewarded for persisting. Kean’s mother, Isabelle, is Ivorian but Moise was born in Vercelli, in northern Italy, before being spotted by scouts from Torino and brought into their academy system. Juventus lured him away from their city rivals at 14. On the day he signed his first professional contract, Kean called his mum and told her she could stop working and come to live with him.It was apparent already that he had a special talent. Kean was averaging close to a goal per game for Juventus’ youth sides even when placed with kids three or four years older. He became the youngest player to appear for their first team when he made his debut at 16, and soon after that became the first person born in the 2000s to appear in a Champions League match.Itching for more opportunities, he went on loan to Verona for 2017-18. A tally of four goals in 20 appearances looks modest but his season was disrupted by injury, and that was still enough to make him joint-top scorer in a team relegated by early May.It was Ronaldo’s signing that persuaded him to return to Juventus last summer, instead of seeking another move away. “During training, I try to watch everything he does, from the way he carries himself on the pitch to his desire to play, to train, and to always be ready,” Kean would explain. “You should not underestimate the benefits of training with a great champion. I observe and then I try to apply what I’ve learned.”Finally, this spring, Kean got his chance to put those lessons into action. He scored the goal that knocked Bologna out of the Coppa Italia, then marked his first Serie A start for Juventus with a double against Udinese. Kean might have had a hat-trick, but the penalty he won was given to Emre Can. Ronaldo, watching from the dugout, was seen imitating Kean’s stepovers after the second goal. When the Portuguese got injured on international duty later that month, Kean scored in all three games that Ronaldo missed to keep Juventus on track for their eighth consecutive Serie A title.Kean’s physical gifts are obvious. He stands close to 6ft, with a muscular build and acceleration that few defenders can live with. Yet different traits mark him apart: the courage to take on an opponent when travelling at top speed and the quickness of thought to understand when he has them off-balance and know which shoulder to attack. He is a solid finisher and can play through the middle but looks most at home cutting in from the flank.There is a mischievousness in his approach which can stray into occasional over-indulgence, but it is married to a robust work ethic. The two threads come together in stories he tells of his childhood, when he would steal footballs from his local priest when that was the only way to get a game.Kean has been compared to Mario Balotelli, and it is true that as youth player at Juventus he once celebrated a goal by revealing a T-shirt with the familiar message ‘Why Always Me’. The pair share a friendship, as well as some unpleasant life experiences. Each has been racially abused in their home country for the colour of their skin.Yet they are different personalities with markedly different playing styles. Kean has made mistakes of his own – he was sent home from an Italy Under-19 training camp in 2017 with Gianluca Scamacca amid reports of a practical joke gone awry, and he was left out of Italy’s Under-21 side for their European Championship game against Belgium this summer after showing up late for a team meeting – but so have a great many other young players.And Kean has excelled while representing his country as well. He scored three goals across the semi-final and final as Italy fell just short in the Under-19 Euros last year. Kean marked his first start for the senior national team, this March, by becoming the youngest player to score for them in a competitive game – helping to deliver a 2-0 win over Finland – then followed up with a further goal against Liechtenstein three days later.“Yes we Kean,” screamed the front pages of Italy’s sporting newspapers on the morning after the win over Finland – echoing Barack Obama’s famous slogan. It is too soon to know whether a teenager with 17 top-flight starts can live up to the high hopes being piled upon him. Yet it is easy to see why his presence would breed enthusiasm for Everton’s Premier League campaign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6e72bcc316c5dd632d5c8cc47c52911682e7e53/0_94_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8d701ac850645f4c69469b5f5359d36","title":"premier league 2019 20 preview leicester brendan rodgers perez tielemans","story":"The captures of Ayoze Pérez and Youri Tielemans have the potential to lift Brendan Rodgers’ buoyant side up another level writers’ predicted position: 7th (NB: this is not necessarily Paul Doyle’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 250-1It is advancing nicely, Leicester City’s plan to evolve from blue sky champions into contenders for all seasons. No one expects the upcoming campaign to yield a repeat of the 2016 title bonanza but Brendan Rodgers’ team could prove to be better than the league-winning one even without achieving as much. Leicester have a squad full of energy, invention and versatility, and they should threaten the elite this season no matter what becomes of Harry Maguire.Rodgers has the tools and knowhow to build on the useful work done by his predecessor, Claude Puel. The Frenchman began Leicester’s transition from counterattacking sensations to slick all-rounders but he did not have the personality or personnel to complete it. Rodgers is better armed. For a start, he may well have found the solution to the riddle that has stumped Leicester for much of the past three seasons: what to do when opponents neutralise Jamie Vardy by depriving him of space?The answer is to give Vardy better support while also developing an attack with more prongs. Ayoze Pérez, signed from Newcastle for £30m, is ideally suited to succeeding where players such as Kelechi Iheanacho and Islam Slimani have failed. Pérez gives Rodgers precious options because he can play either as a partner for Vardy or as a winger in either role he is skilful and clever enough to link play and deadly enough to finish most chances. Think of him as a belated upgrade on dear Shinji Okazaki, with far more goals plus occasional razzle-dazzle on the wing.Leicester’s other big summer signing is likely to prove even more valuable. Youri Tielemans thrived after being lured on loan by Puel in January and his decision to commit permanently to Leicester is a powerful endorsement and driver of the club’s hopes under Rodgers. If the Belgian, 22, can consistently produce the form he showed in a dozen league games last season, then Leicester will be uplifted by one of the finest playmakers in the Premier League.Tielemans’ vision and passing can elevate Leicester to a higher level, enabling them to unhinge defences with faster and less predictable attacks. And opponents dare not over-commit to stifling him because doing so would give more freedom to Leicester’s other mischief-makers, particularly James Maddison or any of the team’s bevy of dangerous wide players, whether that be Pérez, the underrated Marc Albrighton (challenge: without even considering his other qualities, name five Premier League players who cross the ball better than Albrighton) or Harvey Barnes, a 21-year-old who can be expected to shred many defences and to develop more composure in front of goal (mind you, something similar was said about Demarai Gray a year ago and he is one of the few young players at Leicester who has not progressed as hoped – but, at 23, he still has time. This is a big season for him.) Rodgers wants to strengthen that armoury by signing another offensive midfielder.The attackers Rodgers deploys, and in whichever formation, are likely to enjoy regular support from two of the best full-backs in the Premier League, Ben Chilwell and Ricardo Pereira.Leicester’s creative talents should revel on the stage secured for them by an excellent midfield linchpin, Wilfried Ndidi, who will be assisted when required by Hamza Choudhury, another young player nurtured under Puel who could flourish even more under Rodgers. In collective terms, at least, the Northern Irishman has shown signs of giving Leicester the cohesion, intensity and tempo that Puel said he was working towards but did not reach regularly.Leicester were often wasteful last season (Opta, for what it is worth, tell us they were a top-six team in terms of chances created, averaging 13.6 per match – or 14 after the arrival of Rodgers – compared with Arsenal’s 12.3). Everything suggests that this term they are are going to create and convert far more chances.But how well will they defend? That depends partly on how they deal with the Maguire fandango. It would obviously be handier for Leicester not to have to replace the England centre-back on the eve of the campaign. He was not at his best last season but was highly influential, a useful carrier and distributor of the ball as well as a formidable stopper whose aerial power was one of the reasons why Leicester conceded fewer goals from set pieces than any other team in the league. But his loss could be mitigated by a smart purchase – the interest in Lewis Dunk, for example, is sensible, as, without being as nimble on the ball as Maguire, the Brighton player is solid. But he, or whoever Leicester signed, would have to find his feet quickly.Indeed, there is a case for Leicester signing another centre-back even if Maguire stays but the club seems to be counting on the classy Jonny Evans avoiding injuries, the 35-year-old Wes Morgan telling Father Time to back off, or Caglar Soyuncu or Filip Benkovic fulfilling their uncertain potential. In goal, at least, there are no doubts: Danny Ward is a sound deputy to the reliable Kasper Schmeichel.Last May Leicester would have introduced a dramatic twist into the title race if not for a wild miss by Iheanacho at Manchester City. By next May they could have really shaken up the top clubs. We will soon have a clearer idea of how likely they are to do that, as their first eight matches include jousts with Wolves, Tottenham, Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool, all of whom finished above them last season and all of whom, unlike Leicester, must contend with European action on top domestic duties this term."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/884b6084ca4936efcff37bf773c3acda6b9ff3c8/0_308_4627_2776/master/4627.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f9fa7ff2393fd39d66b976b3e425caf","title":"salford football league rapid rise target promotion league one class of 92","story":"The Salford City captain, Liam Hogan, says the club’s ambition is to continue their rapid rise by winning a fifth promotion in six seasons. Salford will play in League Two for the first time when they host Stevenage on Saturday but Hogan insists the club, part-owned by the former Manchester United players David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Gary and Phil Neville, with the Singaporean billionaire Peter Lim, are targeting further short-term success.“We’d like to get promotion,” Hogan said. “There is no point beating round the bush saying: ‘We have reached the Football League, we just want to consolidate and enjoy it.’ We have got momentum and a winning mentality instilled in us from the owners and the management and we want to kick on again. There is going to be some tough opposition to get those places in League One but we are going to show ourselves in the best possible light and compete for it. We know the club do not want to stand still.”Hogan also defended the way that the club, who were competing in the Northern Premier League Division One North 10 years ago, have been financially backed by United’s Class of 92. Asked about the criticism he said: “I think it is slightly harsh in terms of the fact they were lads in Salford, playing for the biggest club in England at the time, and Salford had given them a lot. The Cliff that they trained at as a group gave them a lot, they probably hung around in the different locations in Salford and they have obviously seen Salford as a project, literally starting from the bottom. It is not just a case of: ‘We’re going to throw this, this and this at it to make the team better.’”Salford’s manager, Graham Alexander has bolstered his squad, with the signing of Richie Towell, who played in the Championship for Rotherham on loan from Brighton last season, particularly eye-catching. “A couple of years back, you would not be associating Salford City with a Championship player but that’s the sort of calibre that the club is at now,” said Hogan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a05cb8657994b385d0a8deddfd27fe12cfbbd707/0_326_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c19aef30dac3f259d5c8f04ed05f716","title":"birth rate in england and wales at all time low","story":"The birthrate in England and Wales has hit its lowest level since records began, government statistics have shown.The number of live births fell from 11.6 per 1,000 people to 11.1, the lowest since records started in 1938.Although Britain’s ageing population means the proportion of older people compared with women of childbearing age is increasing, the record low in crude birthrates is mostly being driven by falling fertility rates.Except for 1977 and the period between 1999 and 2002, total fertility rates are also lower than all previous years since records began.While crude birthrates are calculated per 1,000 of the entire population, regardless of sex or age, total fertility rates refer only to women between 15 and 44 years old, who are deemed to be of childbearing age.Although women aged 40 and over were the only demographic for whom the rate of fertility did not fall, in 2018 the rate stalled for the first time since the 1970s, at 16.1 per 1,000.Although before 2004 women aged 25 to 29 generally had the highest fertility rate, for the past 15 years women aged 30 to 34 have taken the lead.In 2018 stillbirths reached a record low for the second year running, with 4.1 per 1,000 total births.Ann Berrington, a professor in demography and social statistics at the University of Southampton, said the reasons for the birthrate decline were likely to differ between age groups. As well as “changing aspirations” she said education and expectations were among the possible reasons for fewer teenagers having babies.“There’s been government legislation which means the school leaving age has increased to 18. There’s also been significant improvements in the availability of emergency and long-acting contraception,” she said.Berrington added that she thought people in their 20s and 30s were more likely to postpone having children because of practical factors such as the lack of affordable housing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e102c331f17f5cf9ea91dde5a2c013093c1e5eda/0_550_3273_1964/master/3273.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ca9b2ef343ff593aa102dc4ad12c0d5","title":"cities in summer are like 28 days later magically emptied of people","story":"The roads become bare, queues dwindle and buses proffer seats, revealing things gone unnoticedThere are times of the year – the height of the summer holidays or the period between Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve – when city roads become bare and the pavements clear. Queues dwindle. Buses proffer seats. The clicks of heels echo around empty underground stations. Breathing in lifts becomes a thing. Running is to run undisturbed.Living and working in a city is great, but you can’t escape the rat-race cliches: escalators of necks craning over phones and commuters rearranging themselves in a suited Rubik’s cube to allow a train door to close the struggle to find a space in a pub and the very British request to “perch” at the end of someone else’s table. “Excuse me, is this chair free?” But when the non-native citizens of cities untether themselves from the flat whites, the desk lunches, the club nights, the traffic jams and the naff ads when the out-of-office responses go on and suitcases are filled with swimming gear, or presents, and rolled on to platforms and stuffed into the boots of taxis: that is the magic. That is the smoothing out of terrain like a new map, revealing things gone unnoticed.You remember those amazing shots of an empty Westminster Bridge at the beginning of 28 Days Later? Andrew Macdonald, the film’s producer, explained how they achieved those scenes: by filming in July at 4am, waiting for the sun to come up, grabbing an hour or so of emptiness before rush hour.

Past 11pm on a bank holiday Monday, I was returning from elsewhere as the rest of the capital moisturised, took out their contact lenses and prepared for the return to work. I, meanwhile, boarded a vacant carriage, then alighted at a station without a single soul in it. A mouse scuttled past, but – did I imagine this? – slower than normal.There are opposites to all of this, of course: the year-round lido swimmer bombarded by fairweather dippers when temperatures hit 27C. The galleries suddenly packed out by a celebrity-endorsed exhibition. The quiet park hosting a funfair.

But in the 1940s he had been a teenage trumpet hopeful partnering Charlie Parker and by 1954, when this session was recorded, he had an understatedly personal version of the revolutionary bebop sound. Alongside Sonny Rollins and Thelonious Monk, he reveals it here.A patchily intriguing set from the next decade, flagging the ever-changing Miles’ migration from free-swinging jazz to rock. The saxophonist Wayne Shorter broods, the embryonic soul-star George Benson plays terse guitar, Herbie Hancock debuts the formerly unjazzy Fender Rhodes and Tony Williams drums up a perfect storm.Miles comprehensively burned out in 1975, but while his comeback six years later was uncertain, his 1970s edginess was now softened by the rediscovery of his early lyricism. Good originals such as Back Seat Betty, with its wistful trumpet and hard-thumbed Marcus Miller bass hooks, entered the repertoire.Marcus Miller, Miles’s 1980s svengali, scored and glossily produced this late-career set dedicated to South Africa’s liberation from apartheid. It’s a bit lightweight for its subject, but the Jaco Pastorius tribute is both swinging and soulful, and the title ballad is bittersweet acoustic Miles at his most poignant.Audacious but sympathetic remixes by imaginative producerplayer Bill Laswell, of music from Miles’s heavily experimental 1970s period, including In a Silent Way. While Laswell’s echoey, bass-pumping, beat-swelling treatments sometimes twist the originals way out of shape, their creator’s spirit runs through it all.The director Louis Malle hired a Paris-loving, 31-year-old Miles and a FrenchUS band including the bebop drummer Kenny Clarke to improvise a soundtrack for his noirish 1958 thriller L’Ascenseur Pour L’Echafaud (Lift to the Scaffold). Going only by the visuals, the trumpeter reflected the movie’s desolate romanticism perfectly.Bill Laswell, Miles’s posthumous remixer, called 1972’s On the Corner “mutant hip-hop” – others have heard dub, pre-punk, drum’n’bass and more in its oceanic, thick-textured, harmony-purged turmoil of multiple keyboards, overdubs, saxes and percussion. Long ignored, the session is on its way to rehabilitation.Miles preferred patience, tension, release and expressiveness of tone to the torrents of notes that often characterised bebop. This classy 50s compilation, including the saxophonist Jackie McLean, pianist Horace Silver and drummer Art Blakey, features both his ballad elegance and some of his most surefooted improv over a bop groove.Miles buffs refer to his “first and second great quintets”. The second was the 1960s group including Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams. This, with saxophonist John Coltrane, is the dazzling first. The contrast between the reticent, incisive trumpeter and the unquenchable Coltrane is mesmerising.In 1985, Denmark’s government awarded Miles Davis its normally classical Sonning prize, and Danish trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg wrote an orchestral suite for the star and – somehow – persuaded him to play on it. Superb solos from an engaged and attentive Miles, navigating Mikkelborg’s references to all kinds of 20th-century music.Miles’s last session for Columbia Records, notably including beautiful interpretations of two pop songs – Cyndi Lauper’s Time After Time and Michael Jackson’s Human Nature. Also striking is guitar newcomer John Scofield’s fast and convoluted title-track blues, one of the great original compositions for a late-period Miles lineup.The dense, dark, Latin-fusion epic Bitches Brew was a landmark of production as well as musicianship from a superb band including Wayne Shorter, John McLaughlin, Chick Corea and Jack DeJohnette. The players improvised for hours the producer, Teo Macero, and Miles cut-and-pasted the results into distinct tracks later.Along with Kind of Blue, Milestones is a masterpiece from the 1950s quintet including John Coltrane – expanded to a sextet here by gospel-y alto saxophonist Julian “Cannonball” Adderley. The springy, airborne title track is a standout, as is the leader’s incisive improv on Thelonious Monk’s Straight, No Chaser.Most at ease in small groups, Miles Davis was also a poetic soloist in concerto-like roles with a big band. His long and fruitful relationship with the Canadian composerarranger Gil Evans gets a spectacular airing on Spanish themes including the smouldering Concierto de Aranjuez, and the quietly conversational Solea.Maybe the best-ever representation of “the second great quintet” at work. Superbly recorded live at Chicago’s Plugged Nickel club, the set finds Miles, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams reinventing small-band jazz with an all-but-psychic flexibility of timing and on-the-fly harmonising.The young Miles wanted to play bebop’s revolutionary conceptions in a more ethereal, less impatient way than its first pioneers. With likeminded souls including saxophonist Gerry Mulligan and Lee Konitz, and the composerarranger Gil Evans, he formed this delicately groundbreaking chamber ensemble, an influence on the jazz sound still.A beautiful makeover of the Gershwin opera – give or take a little shaky section playing in the under-rehearsed band – with Miles’s trumpet soaring over a Gil Evans-arranged orchestra. His exhortations over the shouts of the band on Prayer, and his supple, gliding solo on Summertime are standouts.From a film-score assignment about boxing legend Jack Johnson, Miles launched a new band (hiring Stevie Wonder bassist Michael Henderson among others) and built a thrillingly hard-rocking sound out of long studio jams and radical editing. The seeds of his next five years are in this uncompromising music.Time stands still on this 1969 Davis classic. Electric sounds and textures (notably from new guitarist John McLaughlin and keyboardist Joe Zawinul) make clear breaks from the trumpeter’s acoustic bands – but Miles’s horn and Wayne Shorter’s keening soprano sax sketch passages of an exquisite, irresistible tranquillity.Revered by pundits and fans, radiating an enduringly contemporary sound, and with un-jazz-like sales of 4 million plus at the last count, Kind of Blue – the 1959 session recorded in just a few hours and with minimal rehearsal – changed the way listeners and practitioners everywhere heard and made music. The Milestones band, with John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley on saxes, was the core, with the graceful pianist Bill Evans added, and the use of modes rather than song chords throughout gave the music an ethereal, free-associative spaciousness that draws new audiences to jazz to this day.Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema - ranked!Michael Caine\u0027s best films - ranked!The 10 best Glenn Close movies - ranked!Tom Cruise - top 20 movies - ranked!Judi Dench - every film - ranked!Ryan Gosling movies - ranked!10 best Hugh Grant films - ranked!Nicole Kidman’s top 10 films - ranked!The best and the worst Jennifer Lopez films - ranked!All Helen Mirren\u0027s 61 movies - ranked!Robert Redford\u0027s greatest screen roles - ranked!Winona Ryder\u0027s 20 best films - ranked!Movie Santa Clauses - ranked!Jason Statham - every film - ranked!Emma Thompson\u0027s best films - ranked!Biopics trashed by families, friends and fans - ranked!Purr evil: cats in movies with hidden agendas - ranked!Dog weepie movies - ranked!Top 20 J-horror films - ranked!Movies that have grossed more than $1bn - ranked!Palme d\u0027Or winners - ranked!The scariest horror films ever - ranked!The best Shakespeare films - ranked!The 10 best movie shark performances - ranked!Worst holidays in cinema - ranked!James Bond on film – 007\u0027s best and worst movies - ranked!The 20 best Marvel films - ranked!Top 10 Merchant Ivory films - ranked!Pixar - every film ever made - ranked!Planet of the Apes - the best and worst of the movies - ranked!Star Wars - every film - ranked!The 20 best music documentaries - ranked!The weirdest Brits performances - ranked!Game of Thrones - every episode - ranked!Oscar nominees - the weirdest ever - ranked!Oscar snubs - the 20 greatest ever - ranked!The biggest Rock \u0026amp Roll Hall of Fame snubs ever - ranked!Super Bowl half-time shows - the 10 greatest - ranked!The best X Factor finalists - ranked!From Niall Horan\u0027s toast to Russell Crowe’s jockstrap: celebrity auction items - ranked!All Abba\u0027s UK singles - ranked!Every one of Madonna\u0027s 78 singles - ranked!Kate Bush – every UK single - ranked!Queen\u0027s 50 UK singles - ranked!Taylor Swift\u0027s singles - ranked!The Who: their UK singles - ranked!Black Sabbath - every album - ranked!David Byrne – (almost) all of his albums - ranked!Miles Davis\u0027s 20 greatest albums – ranked!Lil Wayne\u0027s albums - ranked!Every Mercury prize-winning album - ranked!The Rolling Stones – every album - ranked!10 best Paul Simon albums - ranked!Bruce Springsteen\u0027s albums - ranked!Kanye West – every album - ranked!Stevie Wonder\u0027s albums - ranked!20 greatest breakup songs ever - ranked!Aphex Twin\u0027s best songs - ranked!Barry Manilow – all his greatest songs - ranked!Cher\u0027s 30 greatest songs - ranked!The 30 greatest Disney songs –\u0026nbspranked!Elton John\u0027s 50 greatest songs - ranked!From Drake to Wet Wet Wet: songs with 10 weeks at No 1 - ranked!From MC5 to Jeff Mills: the greatest Detroit tracks ever - ranked!Giorgio Moroder\u0027s 20 greatest songs - ranked!Nirvana\u0027s 20 greatest songs - ranked!The best songs from teen movies - ranked!The best UK garage tracks - ranked!The greatest banned songs of all time - ranked!The greatest ever female rap tracks - ranked!The greatest pop music dance crazes - ranked!All 43 Spice Girls songs - ranked!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcfe59549992952d27c14827702c2b324bac4ff1/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1004c36ecf49815729edcbe6d936ff83","title":"a sneaker peek behind the scenes at new balance","story":"Since 1982, New Balance has produced its flagship 990s at one of two US factories. We take a look at the craftsmanship that goes into each trainer at the site in MassachusettsFew trainers can claim a fanbase as erse as that of the New Balance 990 series. The first trainer to cost $100 when it was released in 1982, it was a performance running shoe that was eventually embraced for its nerdy dad look (the late Steve Jobs was a fan), while also acquiring street cred in Baltimore and DC. Meanwhile, the 990v4, which was released in 2016, popped up at fashion shows while being name checked by rappers such as Meek Mill and Lil Yachty.Each pair of 990v5s takes three hours to make they’re constructed from more than 30 different components and are handled by more than 30 workers. Tejada is the leader of the “closing” team, which puts the final touches on the shoe – hand-sewing the leather and suede in the heel. She’s been sewing at New Balance for 31 years, and first put needle to thread when she was a nine-year-old girl under the watchful eye of her mother, who was a seamstress in the Dominican Republic, where Tejada grew up.“I have sewn all my life. This is my pride,” she says. “When I’m sewing, I am happy – I am doing what I learned, with high quality. No run-off. Clean lines, everything where it needs to be.”Eric Vassall, the senior product manager at New Balance in charge of the 990 series, believes the craftsmanship and experience that workers such as Tejada bring to bear is part of what has made the shoe appeal to so many distinct markets.“I’ve been here 19 years and you see generation after generation after generation. So you have the mother who has been here that taught the daughter, who had taught the son,” he says.And at New Balance, the workers don’t just make the shoes – they are also integrated into the design process. This is only possible because, unlike most of its competitors, New Balance both manufactures and designs the bulk of its trainers in the same offices. This means that instead of emails going back and forth across different time zones, workers can give designers and engineers direct feedback in person.For Vassall, the fact that his team only works a few floors above the production line has been crucial. It allows them to make quick adjustments and, ultimately, produce a better product.“I would say for the latest version of the 990, the 990v5, we always would come downstairs and talk to the craftspeople and say: ‘Hey, what’s working, what’s not working?’”Jesse Plouffe, the product developer who worked on the 990v5, says workers like Tejada have made him better at his job.“They’re experts. I can’t tell them how to stitch the shoe. I have no idea how to stitch it. I know what I want to do, but they are experts and the value they add is incredible,” he says.And the atmosphere on the line embodies that spirit of collaboration. The workers move quickly – they each have just 22.5 seconds to complete their task – but still find moments to greet each other warmly.Luis Puello, a 51-year-old leather cutter, carefully runs his hands across a sheet of pig’s hide, looking for defects that he marks with a laser before a machine makes a cut. Over the years, he says, he has developed a better feel for the leather, quickly sensing which parts will function best in different areas of the shoe.He smiles when asked what he thinks about the 990s that he helps make every day. “When the job is done, you see what you’ve done, and you feel proud,” he says.New Balance’s 990v5s are available at the New Balance London flagship store or newbalance"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e45c4c0421651847b2fb3c89c779c96825af739a/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9104a8fbe287510bd6c4115b3bfdbaa","title":"the evolution of the new balance 99x series in pictures","story":"The New Balance 990v5 – which was released in the UK in May this year – is the latest trainer in a 37-year footwear dynasty.

By  Jia TolentinoThe ideal woman has always been generic. I bet you can picture the version of her that runs the show today. She’s of indeterminate age but resolutely youthful presentation. She’s got glossy hair and the clean, shameless expression of a person who believes she was made to be looked at. She is often luxuriating when you see her – on remote beaches, under stars in the desert, across a carefully styled table, surrounded by beautiful possessions or photogenic friends. Showcasing herself at leisure is either the bulk of her work or an essential part of it in this, she is not so unusual – for many people today, especially for women, packaging and broadcasting your image is a readily monetizable skill. She has a personal brand, and probably a boyfriend or husband: he is the physical realization of her constant, unseen audience, reaffirming her status as an interesting subject, a worthy object, a self-generating spectacle with a viewership attached.Can you see this woman yet? She looks like an Instagram – which is to say, an ordinary woman reproducing the lessons of the marketplace, which is how an ordinary woman evolves into an ideal. The process requires maximal obedience on the part of the woman in question, and – ideally – her genuine enthusiasm, too. This woman is sincerely interested in whatever the market demands of her (good looks, the impression of indefinitely extended youth, advanced skills in self-presentation and self-surveillance). She is equally interested in whatever the market offers her – in the tools that will allow her to look more appealing, to be even more endlessly presentable, to wring as much value out of her particular position as she can.The ideal woman, in other words, is always optimizing. She takes advantage of technology, both in the way she broadcasts her image and in the meticulous improvement of that image itself. Her hair looks expensive. She spends lots of money taking care of her skin, a process that has taken on the holy aspect of a spiritual ritual and the mundane regularity of setting a morning alarm.The work formerly carried out by makeup has been embedded directly into her face: her cheekbones or lips have been plumped up, or some lines have been filled in, and her eyelashes are lengthened every four weeks by a professional wielding inidual lashes and glue. The same is true of her body, which no longer requires the traditional enhancements of clothing or strategic underwear it has been pre-shaped by exercise that ensures there is little to conceal or rearrange.Everything about this woman has been pre-emptively controlled to the point that she can afford the impression of spontaneity and, more important, the sensation of it – having worked to rid her life of artificial obstacles, she often feels legitimately carefree. The ideal woman can be whatever she wants to be – as long as she manages to act upon the belief that perfecting herself and streamlining her relationship to the world can be a matter of both work and pleasure, or, in other words, of “lifestyle”. The ideal woman steps into a stratum of expensive juices, boutique exercise classes, skincare routines and vacations, and there she happily remains.Most women believe themselves to be independent thinkers. Even glossy women’s magazines now model skepticism toward top-down narratives about how we should look, who and when we should marry, how we should live. But the psychological parasite of the ideal woman has evolved to survive in an ecosystem that pretends to resist her. If women start to resist an aesthetic, like the overapplication of Photoshop, the aesthetic just changes to suit us the power of the ideal image never actually wanes. It is now easy enough to engage women’s skepticism toward ads and magazine covers, images produced by professionals. It is harder for us to suspect images produced by our peers, and nearly impossible to get us to suspect the images we produce of ourselves, for our own pleasure and benefit – even though, in a time when heavy social media use has become broadly framed as a career asset, many of us are effectively professionals now, too.Today’s ideal woman is of a type that coexists easily with feminism in its current market-friendly and mainstream form. This sort of feminism has organized itself around being as visible and appealing to as many people as possible it has greatly over-valorized women’s inidual success. Feminism has not eradicated the tyranny of the ideal woman but, rather, has entrenched it and made it trickier. These days, it is perhaps even more psychologically seamless than ever for an ordinary woman to spend her life walking toward the idealized mirage of her own self-image. She can believe – reasonably enough, and with the full encouragement of feminism – that she herself is the architect of the exquisite, constant and often pleasurable type of power that this image holds over her time, her money, her decisions, her selfhood and her soul.Figuring out how to “get better” at being a woman is a ridiculous and often amoral project – a subset of the larger, equally ridiculous, equally amoral project of learning to get better at life under accelerated capitalism. In these pursuits, most pleasures end up being traps, and every public-facing demand escalates in perpetuity. Satisfaction remains, under the terms of the system, necessarily out of reach.But the worse things get, the more a person is compelled to optimize. I think about this every time I do something that feels particularly efficient and self-interested, like going to a barre class or eating lunch at a fast-casual chopped-salad chain, like Sweetgreen, which feels less like a place to eat and more like a refueling station. I’m a repulsively fast eater in most situations – my boyfriend once told me that I chew like someone’s about to take my food away – and at Sweetgreen, I eat even faster because (as can be true of many things in life) slowing down for even a second can make the machinery give you the creeps. Sweetgreen is a marvel of optimization: a line of 40 people – a texting, shuffling, eyes-down snake – can be processed in 10 minutes, as customer after customer orders a kale caesar with chicken without even looking at the other, darker-skinned, hairnet-wearing line of people who are busy adding chicken to kale caesars as if it were their purpose in life to do so and their customers’ purpose in life to send emails for 16 hours a day with a brief break to snort down a bowl of nutrients that ward off the unhealthfulness of urban professional living.The ritualization and neatness of this process (and the fact that Sweetgreen is pretty good) obscure the intense, circular artifice that defines the type of life it’s meant to fit into. The ideal chopped-salad customer needs to eat his $12 salad in 10 minutes because he needs the extra time to keep functioning within the job that allows him to afford a regular $12 salad in the first place. He feels a physical need for this $12 salad, as it’s the most reliable and convenient way to build up a vitamin barrier against the general malfunction that comes with his salad-requiring-and-enabling job. As Matt Buchanan wrote at the Awl in 2015, the chopped salad is engineered to “free one’s hand and eyes from the task of consuming nutrients, so that precious attention can be directed toward a small screen, where it is more urgently needed, so it can consume data: work email or Amazon’s nearly infinite catalog or Facebook’s actually infinite News Feed, where, as one shops for diapers or engages with the native advertising sprinkled between the not-hoaxes and baby photos, one is being productive by generating revenue for a large internet company, which is obviously good for the economy, or at least it is certainly better than spending lunch reading a book from the library, because who is making money from that?”On today’s terms, what Buchanan is describing is the good life. It means progress, iniduation. It’s what you do when you’ve gotten ahead a little bit, when you want to get ahead some more. The hamster-wheel aspect has been self-evident for a long time now. But today, in an economy defined by precarity, more of what was merely stupid and adaptive has turned stupid and compulsory. Vulnerability, which is ever present, must be warded off at all costs. And so I go to Sweetgreen on days when I need to eat vegetables very quickly because I’ve been working till 1am all week and don’t have time to make dinner because I have to work till 1am again, and like a chump, I try to make eye contact across the sneeze guard, as if this alleviated anything about the skyrocketing productivity requirements that have forced these two lines of people to scarf and create kale caesars all day, and then I “grab” my salad and eat it in under 10 minutes while looking at email.It’s very easy, under conditions of artificial but continually escalating obligation, to find yourself organizing your life around practices you find ridiculous and possibly indefensible. Women have known this intimately for a long time.I was a late bloomer in terms of functional physical practices, like eating vegetables and exercising. I was a gymnast as a kid and then a cheerleader later, but one thing was fun and the second was effectively a requirement: at my school, you had to play a sport, and I lacked the hand-eye coordination to do anything else. As a teenager, I subsisted on pizza and queso and cinnamon rolls, trying to immunize myself with apathy and pleasure-seeking throughout the long stretch of time when girls, overwhelmed by sudden expectations of beauty, transmit anorexia and bulimia to one another like a virus. For the better part of a decade, I figured I was better off being slightly unhealthy and leaving the active pursuit of body-related matters alone.This all changed when I was 21 and volunteering in the Peace Corps. Under the circumstances, it was impossible to think too much about my appearance, and health was of such immediate importance it was always on my mind. I started doing yoga in my room every day as a prophylactic measure against mental breakdown. When I returned to America in 2011, I kept at it. Yoga helped me be gentle to myself during the process of readjustment, when I was constantly flooded with dread and spiritual uselessness, the sense that I had failed.And then, in 2012, at the end of a yoga class, I felt something shift. I was in grad school, deep in a period of daytime beers and open-ended self-discovery, and I was lying in final resting pose, suddenly wondering why motionlessness was supposed to be relaxing. The specter of stagnation hung heavy over my existence. I missed, suddenly, the part of me that thrilled to sharpness, harshness, discipline. I had been directing these instincts at my mind, hiding them from my body, but why? At that moment I needed something stronger than yoga, the unrestricted ease of which had reminded me, just then, that I didn’t know what I was doing, and likely never would.So, later that week, I printed out a Groupon trial offer at a studio called Pure Barre. I was greeted by an instructor who looked like Jessica Rabbit: ice-green eyes, a physically impossible hourglass figure, honey-colored hair rippling down past her waist. She ushered me into a cave-dark room full of sinewy women gathering mysterious red rubber props. The front wall was mirrored. The women stared at their reflections, stone-faced, preparing.Then class started, and it was an immediate state of emergency. Barre is a manic and ritualized activity, often set to deafening music and lighting changes. The rapid-fire series of positions and movements, dictated and enforced by the instructor, resembled what a ballerina might do if you concussed her and then made her snort caffeine pills – a fanatical, repetitive routine of arm gestures, leg lifts and pelvic tilts.By the end of class, my leg muscles had liquefied. Jessica turned the lights off and chirped that it was time for “back dancing”, a term that I thought, collapsing on to the floor, sounded like what people on a parenting message board might use as a euphemism for sex. It was, in fact, pretend-fucking: we lay on our backs and thrust our hips into the darkness with a sacrificial devotion that I had not applied to actual sex for years. The lights went on. Jessica cooed: “Great job, ladies.” Everybody clapped.Barre was invented in the 60s by Lotte Berk, a Jewish ballerina who developed an exercise method based on her dance training, and at 46, with her rigidly disciplined body as a walking billboard, founded a women-only exercise studio in a basement on London’s Manchester Street. It is now a national fixture across the US. The rise of barre is unparalleled in a few aspects: as far as exercise methods go, nothing this expensive and this uniform has gone this big. Hot yoga and pilates are both ubiquitous, but the pursuits have expanded at the level of inidual studios rather than nationwide chains. (Yoga classes also mostly hover around $20 or less, where barre, if you pay full price, often costs double that.) Among hundreds of thousands of women in dramatically different political and cultural environments, there seems to be an easy agreement that barre is worth it.In grad school in the midwest, I became a believer. I had been primed, first with my girlishly regimented physical training – dance, gymnastics, cheerleading – and then with yoga, my therapeutic on-ramp to the thing I was slowly realizing, which was that you could, without obvious negative consequences, control the way your body felt on the inside and worked on the outside by paying people to give you orders in a small, mirrored room. Barre was much too expensive for my grad school budget, but I kept paying for it. It seemed like an investment in a more functional life.Was it health I was investing in? In a very narrow way, it was. Barre has made me stronger and improved my posture. It has given me the luxury – off-limits to so many people, for so many stupid reasons – of not having to think about my body, because it mostly feels good, mostly works.But the endurance that barre builds is possibly more psychological than physical. What it’s really good at is getting you in shape for a hyper-accelerated capitalist life. It prepares you less for a half marathon than for a 12-hour workday, or a week alone with a kid and no childcare, or an evening commute on an underfunded train. Barre feels like exercise the way Sweetgreen feels like eating: both might better be categorized as mechanisms that help you adapt to arbitrary, prolonged agony. As a form of exercise, barre is ideal for an era in which everyone has to work constantly – you can be back at the office in five minutes, no shower necessary – and in which women are still expected to look unreasonably good.And of course it’s that last part, the looks thing, that makes barre feel so worthwhile to so many people. Barre is results-driven and appearance-based – it’s got the cultishness of CrossFit or a boot camp class, but with looks, not strength, as its primary goal. It’s only vaguely connected to ballet in terms of your actual movements, but conceptually, ballet is essential to the pitch. Among women, ballerinas have a uniquely legitimate reason to look taut and disciplined. There are plenty of other women who are thin and graceful-looking by professional requirement – models, escorts, actors – but ballerinas meet the beauty standard not just in the name of appearance or performance but also in the name of high athleticism and art. And so an exercise method even nominally drawn from ballet has the subtle effect of giving regular women a sense of serious, artistic, professional purpose in their pursuit of their ideal body. This is a good investment or, more precisely, a pragmatic self-delusion. Learning how to function more efficiently within an exhausting system: this seems to me to be the thing, with barre, that people pay $40 a class for, the investment that always brings back returns.The term “optimize” was used for the first time the way we currently use it, in economics, in the mid 19th century. “To satisfy our wants to the utmost with the least effort – to procure the greatest amount of what is desirable at the expense of the least that is undesirable – in other words, to maximize pleasure, is the problem of economics,” wrote William Stanley Jevons in The Theory of Political Economy. We all want to get the most out of what we have.Today, the principle of optimization – the process of making something, as the dictionary puts it, “as fully perfect, functional, or effective as possible” – thrives in extremity. An entire industry has even sprung up to give optimization a uniform: athleisure, the type of clothing you wear when you are either acting on or signaling your desire to have an optimized life. I define athleisure as exercise gear that you pay too much money for, but defined more broadly, athleisure was a $97bn category by 2016.Since its emergence around a decade ago, athleisure has gone through a few aesthetic iterations. At first, it was black leggings and colorful tank tops – a dex version of an early-aughts going-out uniform favored by women who might have, by the time of athleisure’s rise, shifted their daily social interactions to yoga and coffee dates. More recently, athleisure has branched off and reconverged in permutations. There is a sort of cosmic hippie look (elaborate prints, webbed galaxy patterns), a sort of monochrome LA look (mesh, neutrals, baseball hats), a minimalist and heathered Outdoor Voices aesthetic, and an influx of awful slogans like “I’ll See You at the Barre”. Brands include Lululemon (“Wunder Under High-Rise Tights”, described as “edgy”, cost $98), Athleta (“Pacifica Contoured Hoodie Tank”, a hooded tank top, is $59), Sweaty Betty (“Power Wetlook Mesh Crop Leggings”, which are “Bum Sculpting? You Bet Your Ass”, $120), the ghoulish brand Spiritual Gangster (leggings with “Namaste” across the ass, $88 cotton tank top screen-printed with “I’ll see it when I believe it”, $56).Men wear athleisure, but the idea, and the vast majority of the category, belongs to women. It was built around the habits of stay-at-home mums, college students, fitness professionals, off-duty models – women who wore exercise clothing outside an exercise setting and who, like ballerinas, have heightened reasons to monitor the market value of their looks. This deep incentive is hidden by a bunch of more obvious ones: these clothes are easy to wear, machine-washable, wrinkle-proof. Athleisure – like all optimization experiences and products – is reliably comfortable and supportive in a world that is not. In 2016, Moira Weigel wrote, at Real Life magazine, “Lululemons announce that for the wearer, life has become frictionless.” She recalls putting on a pair of Spanx shapewear for the first time: “The word for how my casing made me feel was optimized.”Spandex – the material in both Spanx and expensive leggings – was invented during the second world war, when the military was trying to develop new parachute fabrics. It is uniquely flexible, resilient and strong. It feels comforting to wear high-quality dex, but this sense of reassurance is paired with an undercurrent of demand. Shapewear controls the body under clothing athleisure broadcasts your commitment to controlling your body through working out. And to even get into a pair of Lululemons, you have to have a disciplined-looking body. (The founder of the company once said that “certain women” aren’t meant to wear his brand.) “Self-exposure and self-policing meet in a feedback loop,” Weigel wrote. “Because these pants only ‘work’ on a certain kind of body, wearing them reminds you to go out and get that body.”This is how athleisure has carved out the space between exercise apparel and fashion: the former category optimizes your performance, the latter optimizes your appearance, and athleisure does both simultaneously. It is tailor-made for a time when work is rebranded as pleasure so that we will accept more of it – a time when, for women, improving your looks is a job that you’re supposed to believe is fun. And the real trick of athleisure is the way it can physically suggest that you were made to do this – that you’re the kind of person who thinks that putting in expensive hard work for a high-functioning, maximally attractive consumer existence is about as good a way to pass your time on Earth as there is.I recently bought my first pair of Spanx in preparation for a wedding. My oldest friend was getting married in Texas, and the bridesmaids’ dresses – for all 13 of us – were pale pink, floor-length and as tight as shrink-wrap from the strapless neckline to the knees. When I first tried the dress on, I could see the inside of my belly button in the mirror. Frowning, I went online and bought a $98 “Haute Contour® High-Waisted Thong”. It arrived a few days later, and I tried it on with the dress: I couldn’t breathe properly, I immediately started sweating and everything looked even worse. “What the fuck,” I said, staring at my reflection. I looked like a bad imitation of a woman whose most deeply held personal goal was to look hot in pictures. And of course, in that moment, in a $98 punishment thong and a dress designed for an Instagram model, that’s exactly what I was.The ideal woman looks beautiful, happy, carefree and perfectly competent. Is she really? To look any particular way and to actually be that way are two separate concepts, and striving to look carefree and happy can interfere with your ability to feel so. The internet codifies this problem, makes it inescapable in recent years, pop culture has started to reflect the fractures in selfhood that social media creates. Not coincidentally, these stories usually center on women, and usually involve a protagonist driven to insanity by the digital avatar of an ideal peer. There is an exaggerated binary fatalism to these stories, in which women are either successes or failures, always one or the other – and a sense of inescapability that rings more true to life. If you can’t escape the market, why stop working on its terms?Women are genuinely trapped at the intersection of capitalism and patriarchy – two systems that, at their extremes, ensure that inidual success comes at the expense of collective morality. And yet there is enormous pleasure in inidual success. It can feel like license and agency to approach an ideal, to find yourself – in a good picture, on your wedding day, in a flash of identical movement – exemplifying a prototype. There are rewards for succeeding under capitalism and patriarchy there are rewards even for being willing to work on its terms. There are nothing but rewards, at the surface level. The trap looks beautiful. It’s well-lit. It welcomes you in.There is a case, as laid out by Donna Haraway in her tricky 1985 essay A Cyborg Manifesto, for understanding the female condition as essentially, fundamentally adulterated and for seeking a type of freedom compatible with that state. “At the center of my ironic faith, my blasphemy, is the image of the cyborg,” she wrote. The cyborg was a “hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction”. The late 20th century had “made thoroughly ambiguous the difference between natural and artificial, mind and body, self-developing and externally designed, and many other distinctions that used to apply to organisms and machines. Our machines are disturbingly lively, and we ourselves frighteningly inert.”Haraway imagined that women, formed in a way that makes us inextricable from social and technological machinery, could become fluid and radical and resistant. We could be like cyborgs – shaped in an image we didn’t choose for ourselves, and disloyal and disobedient as a result. “Illegitimate offspring are often exceedingly unfaithful to their origins. Their fathers, after all, are inessential,” Haraway wrote. The cyborg was “oppositional, utopian, and completely without innocence”. She would understand that the terms of her life had always been artificial. She would – and what an incredible possibility! – feel no respect whatsoever for the rules by which her life played out.In real life, women are so much more obedient. Our rebellions are so trivial and small. Lately, the ideal women of Instagram have started chafing, just a little, against the structures that surround them. The anti-Instagram statement is now a predictable part of the modelinfluencer social media life cycle: a beautiful young woman who goes to great pains to maintain and perform her own beauty for an audience will eventually post a note on Instagram revealing that Instagram has become a bottomless pit of personal insecurity and anxiety. She’ll take a week-long break from the social network, and then, almost always, she will go on exactly as before. Resistance to a system is almost always presented on the terms of the system. It’s so much easier, when we gain agency, to use it to adapt rather than to oppose.Technology, in fact, has made us less than oppositional: where beauty is concerned, we have deployed technology not only to meet the demands of the system but to actually expand these demands. The realm of what is possible for women has been exponentially expanding in all beauty-related capacities – think of the extended Kardashian experiments in body modification, or the young models whose plastic surgeons have given them entirely new faces – and remained stagnant in many other ways. We have not “optimized” our wages, our childcare system, our political representation we still hardly even think of parity as realistic in those arenas, let alone anything approaching perfection. We have maximized our capacity as market assets. That’s all.For the way out, I think, we have to follow the cyborg. We have to be willing to be disloyal, to undermine. The cyborg is powerful because she grasps the potential in her own artificiality, because she accepts without question how deeply it is embedded in her. It’s possible if we want it. But what do we want? What would you want – what desires, what forms of insubordination, would you be able to access – if you had succeeded in becoming an ideal woman, gratified and beloved, proof of the efficiency of a system that magnifies and diminishes you every day? • Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion by Jia Tolentino is published by 4th Estate on 8 August.

This is the hub of a group of companies stretching from Sydney, Canberra and Auckland to Washington DC and Milan with other outposts on the way.“Whether winning elections for prime ministers, or helping the world’s leading businesses stay ahead, CTF Partners offers clients an unparalleled range of experience and an unrivalled record of success,” states the website for the main UK-based political consultancy arm, which was co-founded by Mark Fullbrook – who took leave to run Boris Johnson’s successful campaign to be Conservative leader.Yet some current and former staff members have spoken about what they described as incidents of misogynistic bullying at the company in recent years, which they say is staffed by a handful of senior executives and a large number of highly ideological rightwing twentysomethings who help run campaigns around the world.One person who worked in the London office described how the company sometimes hired the children of Conservative donors and the offspring of prominent media executives at rightwing news outlets in order to aid their campaigns: “No experience, no knowledge, no interest, no ability. It’s like a posh kindergarten with no one in charge. It would make a good sitcom but in real life it’s scary.”CT Group strongly denied the claim and said they hired entirely on merit.In recent years a key presence in the office has been two young digital strategists from New Zealand called Sean Topham and Ben Guerin, who were employed on retainers of over £10,000 a month to run digital campaigns on behalf of CTF in 2017. The duo, who acted as subcontractors through their own Topham Guerin digital consultancy, have since gone on to play a key role in the unexpected election victory of the rightwing Liberal party in this year’s Australian general election.Topham gained a reputation for misogyny within the company, according to three former staff members, who said at one point he celebrated the fact a woman had been forced out of the office as a “confirmed kill”, a military term supposedly referencing a person shot by a sniper. He was also accused of celebrating the departure of a number of women from CTF’s Sydney office.Topham, through his lawyer, denied any such incidents took place.CT Group said suggestions that their office was in any way tolerant of bullying were “deeply offensive, self evidently extremely defamatory, and wholly untrue”. They said they bring in an independent HR consultant to conduct an annual independent staff survey and that the outside staff have “rarely seen such high scores in terms of levels of staff satisfaction” in any company.“Were any incidents of sexist or bullying behaviour committed by our clients’ staff to take place, they would be dealt with firmly and swiftly,” said the lawyers, who said it was the knowledge and belief of office boss Sam Lyon that “no conduct of this kind has taken place, and he would not tolerate an atmosphere that permitted it”.When presented with descriptions of the incident involving Topham that took place in 2018, which had been reported to managers, Crosby’s lawyers said that the  had been misled by “disgruntled iniduals” providing “false and highly defamatory information”, without denying that complaints had been made.Blue-chip clients regularly turn to CTF to carry out their work on difficult projects.Airbus confirmed they had employed the company to run lobbying campaigns in 2017 and 2018 after the company’s Super Puma helicopter was grounded over safety concerns following a number of fatal crashes while carrying workers to North Sea oil rigs. This involved producing an unbranded Facebook page and accompanying “news” website named Helicopter Newswire to spread positive news about the helicopter, at a time when trade unions were campaigning for tighter safety regulations. Airbus insisted their work was limited to official material and did not indulge in disinformation.In another example of the company’s operations, CTF employees helped run a grassroots online campaign against the cycle superhighway along London’s embankment, despite this being one of Boris Johnson’s flagship policies as mayor of the capital.Multiple sources said the campaigns – under the banners of Londoners for Transport and Unblock the Embankment – were being funded by property development business Canary Wharf Group, which believed the cycle superhighway was slowing drivers trying to reach its financial services offices in London’s Docklands.At the same time, to provide an alternative solution, CTF staff also oversaw an apparently pro-cycling astroturfed campaign on Facebook named Square Mile Cycling. This urged politicians to ert cyclists displaced by ripping up the Embankment route through the City of London’s financial district. This would potentially slow down traffic in the Square Mile – the main rival of Canary Wharf Group.Canary Wharf Group said that “major roads in central London are overstretched beyond their capacity” and they are committed to improving safe cycling infrastructure. They declined to comment on whether they employed Crosby’s company to run the two apparently artificially warring Facebook campaigns."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16c77109ebb7cf0795f67a3cc714ceadd8b442d2/0_22_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e43dabcfadde3eb11547ecd532a1b674","title":"uk less able to cope with hard brexit than in spring say officials","story":"Exclusive: Analysis includes stark assessments of potential problems including panic-buying and civil disorderThe UK is currently less able to cope with a hard Brexit than it was in the spring, with the real risk of panic-buying in the run-up to Christmas and civil disorder if the country leaves the EU without a deal on 31 October, an official document reveals.The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has made Michael Gove responsible for “turbo-charging” Brexit planning, and on Thursday the new chancellor, Sajid Javid, announced an extra £2.1bn of funding to prepare for a no-deal exit.But with less than 100 days to go before the autumn deadline, the Cabinet Office’s own internal analysis includes stark assessments of the potential problems ahead.A document circulating Whitehall shows some of the government’s “reasonable worst-case scenarios” (RCWS) have changed over the summer, including those related to the supply of food and medicines.At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no post-Brexit plan in place, and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports - making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO ‘most favoured nation’ rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods - they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some ‘no deal’ supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to ten years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement (FTA) is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally - the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The Director General of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none.Until some agreements are in place, a ‘no deal’ scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses - for example the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a ‘managed’ no deal envisage that a range of smaller sector-by-sector bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.In a stiffening of language, papers seen by the  say:• A reasonable worst-case scenario is that the supply of medicines and medical supplies “will be impacted by reduced flow rates across the Dover Straits”.• While officials are not anticipating an overall shortage of food, they believe there will be disruption to the food supply chain. This “will lead” to increases in prices of certain fresh produce, “which could impact on vulnerable groups”.• There is also a risk that “panic buying will cause or exacerbate food supply disruption”. The document states: “The UK growing season will have come to an end and the Agri-food supply chain will be under increased pressure at this time of year due to preparations for Christmas, which is the busiest time of year for food retailers.”• Stockpiling of medicines for vets “will not be able to match the 4-12 weeks worth ... which took place in March, 2019”. The document says the options for diminishing these risks are not financially viable, and that any disruption in the supply of medicines “would impact the UK’s ability to prevent and control disease outbreaks”.The document also echoes specific warnings made to government earlier this year, including that “demonstrations are likely to take place across the UK and may absorb significant amounts of police resource. There may also be a rise in public disorder and community tensions.”It reiterates the likelihood that “low income groups may be disproportionately affected by price rises in utilities and services” and by “price rises...including food and fuel”.There is also concern that food banks may struggle for funding – a record 1.6m emergency food parcels were given out by the Trussell Trust food bank network last year – more than 500,000 of them to children.Though ministers insist “worst-case scenarios” are not predictions, they are used by officials for planning purposes to help highlight and address problems.The money announced on Thursday includes sums to pay for stockpiling medicines, though hospital heads have previously warned this might not be enough to stave off shortages.In a further blow to government attempts to downplay the possible risks of a no-deal Brexit, Sky News reported that it had obtained an official document setting out the threats to borders, the economy, security, data, Northern Ireland and iniduals in the month after crashing out.It said the slide – which covers the risks on the first day, first fortnight and first month of no deal – was prepared in the final weeks of Theresa May’s government and appeared to be the first time all the worst-case scenarios had been set out in a single document.Among the problems warned about are “consumer panic and food shortages”, “law and order challenges” in Northern Ireland, operational gaps in security, market volatility and Britons in difficulty abroad returning to the UK. Earlier this week, Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, was asked about the possibility of shortages of medicines. He said this could be avoided “if everybody does what they are being asked to do, particularly around the transport and logistics infrastructure”.Gove is now said to be chairing a daily meeting of senior ministers and advisers to try to mitigate the worst affects of a hard Brexit.Both he and Javid have talked about ramping up no-deal preparations, which includes the extra money from the Treasury, and a nationwide information campaign to help businesses and iniduals get ready.The money will also pay for additional Border Force officers and support for infrastructure around the country’s ports to help minimise congestion and ensure goods can flow.In an article earlier this week, Gove admitted “no deal is now a very real prospect”.“We must make sure that we are ready. A lot has already been done. Thanks to hard work by ministers past and present, and outstanding efforts by the civil service, we have made significant progress.”He added: “There still remains much more to do. Planning for no deal is now this government’s No 1 priority – and that is why we have, since Wednesday, been accelerating preparations.”On Wednesday, a government spokesman reiterated that the UK “is leaving the EU on 31 October whatever the circumstances”.“We will work energetically for a deal but the backstop must be abolished. If we are not able to reach an agreement then we will of course have to leave the EU without a deal.”Concern about a lack of focus on preparations for a no-deal scenario emerged in early June weeks after the Whitehall teams who were engaged in the planning were disbanded.Cabinet ministers are said to have rowed about the issue, with Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, criticising the Treasury for allowing things to “drift”.The Cabinet Office declined to comment, saying it would not comment on leaked documents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cba6010ad99dc9eebd4c0a3dc421a70a690aa64/0_200_5149_3090/master/5149.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd32eadd98e10bac47a86fce696be0f3","title":"alzheimers test predicts onset up to 20 years in advance","story":"A blood test that can detect signs of Alzheimer’s as much as 20 years before the disease begins to have a debilitating effect has been developed by researchers in the US.The results of the study, which was published in the journal Neurology on Thursday, represent a potential breakthrough in the fight against the disease.“Right now we screen people for clinical trials with brain scans, which is time-consuming and expensive, and enrolling participants takes years,” said the senior author, Randall Bateman, a leading professor of neurology.“But with a blood test, we could potentially screen thousands of people a month. That means we can more efficiently enrol participants in clinical trials, which will help us find treatments faster, and could have an enormous impact on the cost of the disease as well as the human suffering that goes with it.”The researchers said they had found a way to measure levels of the protein amyloid beta, a key indicator of Alzheimer’s, in the blood. They can then use such levels to predict whether the protein has accumulated in the brain.That analysis could then be combined with two other major Alzheimer’s risk factors – age and the presence of the genetic variant APOE4 – to accurately identify the relevant changes in the brain.The researchers said the clumps of protein begin to form in the brain up to two decades before the onset of the characteristic memory loss, suggesting the tests could be used to predict Alzheimer’s years in advance.However, the benefits of such testing would not be seen to their fullest extent until treatments to halt the disease are developed.In January 2018, a team of scientists revealed their work on a test that used mass spectrometry techniques to identify patients with a rogue peptide in their blood plasma, indicating a buildup of beta-amyloid in the brain.The latest study looked at 158 people aged older than 50. All but 10 of the participants in the new study were cognitively normal and each provided at least one blood sample and underwent one PET brain scan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8b13f44919fc148260e93f3f6d7e0d30bb0c1cc/0_152_4651_2791/master/4651.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2dae45aa02ce9b52b8f0b176243b1d2","title":"edegbaston hollies stand builds legend","story":"England’s recent success at Edgbaston has seen one particular section of the Birmingham ground gain a reputation for a raucous atmosphere that even Australians can enjoySport is a fine arena to watch truisms develop in real time. Take this: one side of a cricket ground in Birmingham gets more rowdy than other venues. People start to reference it, so others pay it more attention. People who hear about it want to get involved. They dress up and come down and are paid more attention in turn. In time the Eric Hollies Stand is known not as a place but a phenomenon. So the legend feeds itself, getting high on its own supply.After a few wins at Edgbaston against Australia, the legend has grown. English cricket is exceedingly keen to have a mythological reference point to rival the Gabba for Australia: a fortress, a name to make visiting teams quail. Of course, many people refer to Birmingham as the Brisbane of the North or that’s what I would write if newspapers had a sarcasm font. The fortress comparison doesn’t stack up either: a decade unbeaten at Edgbaston for England, three decades for Australia at the Gabba.The Hollies, though, does inject life and energy into Test cricket in its own way. Wander down there on the opening day of the Ashes, and even before the hundreds of man-hours spent queuing at the bars have had their full effect, the atmosphere is febrile.The costumes are loud, flags draped, masks and banners waved. The usual songs ring out but it’s not just Barmy Army stalwarts. David Warner and Cameron Bancroft are almost carried aloft to the crease on a wave of jeers. When Stuart Broad gets each of them out there is a detonation of sound. With each wicket the departing batsman gets a rousing swell of “cheerio, cheerio, cheerio”.Dotted among the union jacks and techno-Hawaiian prints and horse costumes are occasional blotches of bright yellow, not of security stewards but Australian shirts. Of all the gin joints in all the world, what brings a parochial cricket fan from that side of the world into these heaving depths?Shane looks at his friend Mikkel and laughs broadly. “We turned 40 this year and got two weeks to come over to the cricket. So we went in the ballot and these were the tickets we were allocated. We had no idea. I’d never even heard of the Eric Hollies Stand until today.”By this point Australia were four down with England swarming. “All the cricket I’ve been to, nothing compares to the atmosphere at this. It’s worth it, even though we’re being pumped. I find myself singing along now. It’s fantastic, we’ll always remember it. It’s hostile but it’s not personal or anything.”Soon afterwards, the Australia captain, Tim Paine, hooks Broad to a catch at deep midwicket, right in front of the Hollies. The day before he had brushed off a question about whether the ground was intimidating, saying he could think of about 15 others. The response to his exit could definitely be described as hostile.Amy and her husband, draped in various kangaroos and flags and covered in insignia, landed here by accident too. “Greg’s 50th birthday is coming up and these were the tickets that we got. I had no idea. We were a little intimidated but everyone’s so nice and it’s all in good fun.”Andrew was having a ball, draped in a singlet and XXXX hat that paid homage to his upbringing in Townsville, and attending with his English friend Charlie in similar kit. “We had a bet from the previous Ashes that whoever wins it, you have to dress in their attire next time. I would have been in a tweed suit, but he’s here in a bluey and board shorts and a pair of double pluggers.” British readers, feel free to Google Translate that.“We bought eight beach balls off Amazon, we’ve already left half of them go,” said Andrew, who had just covered a St George’s Cross from Polesworth with a boxing kangaroo. “This is my first Ashes anywhere. I bought tickets in November last year. To be in England, at the Ashes – oh, mate. I’m coming again tomorrow.”Rohit, an obvious superfan wearing the new Australian one-day kit, picked his tickets deliberately. “It’s like Bay 13 at the MCG, good atmosphere. We thought we’d be giving stick back to the Poms, unfortunately we’re at the receiving end. The Hollies Stand is known to be one of the rowdiest stands in the world, and what attracted me to it was that when the English give us shit, they do it in a melodious way, they have great voices, and I wanted to be part of that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de5c45100f3d410e7422e208b395a733ec6d4618/846_81_1914_1149/master/1914.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=296c08fbf6277d1a1bba13a7877d20c1","title":"steve smith didnt know play cricket again","story":"Steve Smith shrugged off the boos to score a masterful comeback century that, combined with a series-threatening injury to Jimmy Anderson, leaves England battling for control of the first Ashes Test.Joe Root’s side will resume on 10 for no loss on the second morning at Edgbaston after Smith’s 144 from 219 balls, in his first Test since his 12-month ball-tampering ban, helped Australia reach 284 all out in 80.4 overs. Stuart Broad stood out for England with the ball, claiming five for 86 from 22.4 overs.Australia’s total might have been considered a triumph for England after losing Anderson only four overs into his day’s work, with the 37-year-old pulling up lame and now awaiting scan results on the same right calf muscle that was torn last month.But with the tourists having been reeling at 122 for eight before tea on a seam-friendly pitch – before Smith helped put on 162 runs for the last two wickets and brought up his 24th Test century – England’s batsmen face a tougher task than might otherwise have been.The former Australia captain insisted a hostile reception from elements of the crowd did not affect him. But he admitted to strong emotions upon reaching three figures, having briefly fallen out of love with the game during his well-documented ban.Smith said: “It’s been a long time coming but I’m sort of lost for words. I’m just really proud that I was able to help pull the team out of a bit of trouble. The Aussie supporters that were here were very loud today when I got to a hundred and I just saw the boys going berserk on the balcony, which was just a huge moment.“It was really bizarre that it was the day I got the brace off my elbow, I found a love for it again. I don’t know what it was, it was like a trigger that just said: ‘Right I’m ready to go again, I want to play and I want to go out and play for Australia and make people proud and just do what I love doing.’“I’m really grateful to be in this position now, playing for Australia again and doing what I love.”Broad spoke of his pride at reaching 100 Ashes wickets – “Ashes cricket is the pinnacle, especially with my family history” – and was delighted with the efforts of England’s depleted attack.On his strike partner Anderson, Broad said: “He’s not had the results back yet but he’s down, he’s frustrated, and he’s said sorry to the bowlers – not that he has to. He’s down in the dumps as he feels he’s let the bowling group down but he hasn’t – niggles are part of bowling.”Asked about the match situation, Broad replied: “I forgot how nerve-racking Ashes cricket was. You’d take a total under 300 every day of the week but we don’t know how good a score that will be until we’ve batted.“A positive for us is the way Steve Smith played showed runs can be got out there. Obviously at 122 for eight we wanted much less but he played beautifully.”It was Broad’s first five-wicket haul on home soil since his series-sealing eight for 15 at Trent Bridge during the 2015 Ashes, completed when finally hitting Smith’s stumps to wrap up the Australian innings.And there was a nod to that famous spell with the wicket of Tim Paine. The Australian captain was caught by Rory Burns at deep square leg on the pull as Broad produced another hands-to-mouth look of shock in celebration.Broad explained: “Moeen Ali told me Rooty wanted a bouncer but I didn’t realise that he had moved Burnsy back. Hence the silly face. During our pre-series camp at St George’s Park we were handed dossiers on their batsmen and a few of the plans came off today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e37083d9471d1d8c308896399779efed79543c11/110_6_3216_1929/master/3216.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8bcd59b96d310119c8ee7c619f679f0","title":"wigan hull fc super league zak hardaker rugby league","story":"• Hull FC 14-15 Wigan• O’Loughlin may miss rest of season with torn pectoral muscleThe final weeks of the Super League season are approaching, and there is a familiar feeling in the air. Wigan’s defence of the title they won at Old Trafford last year began somewhat lackadaisically. But with the play-offs looming on the horizon, the Warriors are again showing that desperately craved trait of peaking exactly when it matters.Zak Hardaker’s drop goal ultimately proved to be the difference but, given it was the Warriors who lost an equally thrilling encounter between the sides earlier in the season, the fact they emerged on the right side shows what a threat they are to the leading pack.“It was a replica from earlier in the year, but in our favour,” Wigan’s coach, Adrian Lam, said afterwards. Lam himself had come under immense criticism earlier in the season, but his first season in charge of the Warriors now has all the makings of something special.Here, Wigan battled into a 10-6 half-time lead in which only one try was scored between the sides.That went to Wigan’s Liam Marshall, who claimed a superb cross-field kick to touch down. Two goals from Hardaker – one of which was a penalty for the foul on Marshall in the act of scoring – made it 8-4 in their favour, after an earlier brace of penalties from Marc Sneyd.The one blot on the evening was the loss of their captain, Sean O’Loughlin, to a torn pectoral which could not only end his season but, at the age of 36, perhaps also his career, with no decision made on his future beyond this season. Shortly after he went off, Hardaker and Sneyd exchanged penalties to put the visitors four ahead at half-time.Wigan then appeared to have struck a decisive blow when Marshall’s second opened up a two-score lead, before a try from Scott Taylor and two goals from Hardaker made it 14-14. In a thrilling finale Sneyd twice missed with drop goals but Hardaker was not so wasteful, nervelessly converting from 40 metres to secure another priceless victory for the Warriors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/352913fd4f2e298fd63c80fb24c4f1c03d6e886a/275_615_4722_2833/master/4722.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba3e12ebd0f452d27760f3725befe4d5","title":"talking horses escobar strike golden mile glorious goodwood horse racing tips","story":"Escobar looked back to his very best at York last time out and Jamie Spencer is the right jockey to deliver him on the lineThere is a familiar feel to the betting for the Golden Mile Handicap at Goodwood on Friday afternoon thanks to the presence of David O’Meara’s Escobar towards the top of the market, and he is worth backing at around 8-1 in the hope that he enjoys more luck than he did 12 months ago.Escobar travelled like a winner from the start to the furlong pole, where he was stopped in his tracks when attempting to find a gap. By the time he did find running room, it was too late to make any impression but he was still beaten less than four lengths.Mojito, who beat Escobar in a hot race at Sandown in early July, will be a popular pick with Frankie Dettori taking the ride but Escobar (3.00) looked back to his very best when recording a comfortable success at York last time out and Jamie Spencer is the right jockey to deliver him on the line.Goodwood 1.50 A big field goes to post for this Group Three contest for fillies and mares but plenty look like very optimistic entries and it is hard to see past Sir Michael Stoute’s Jubiloso. A half-sister to the brilliant Frankel, Jubiloso was sent off as a 9-2 chance for the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot last time out when making only the third start of her career. A third place finish was commendable given her inexperience and it will be a real disappointment if she cannot regain the winning thread here.Goodwood 2.25 Turgenev will long be remembered for his near-miss in the Britannia Stakes at Royal Ascot when Frankie Dettori was looking for a five-timer, and his slightly disappointing run at Newmarket’s July meeting may have been a reaction to that huge effort in mid-June. This does not look like the strongest Group Three of the week and while Duke Of Hazzard is on the upgrade, anything close to Turgenev’s Ascot form would probably be enough.Goodwood 3.35 The enigmatic Battaash still has only a single Group One win to his name despite often looking like the fastest horse on the planet through the first four furlongs of his races.

By crunching numbers at unprecedented speed, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, with its 18,000 vacuum tubes, was poised to “revolutionise modern engineering”. Eniac would usher in a new epoch of industrial design, some said.More than 70 years on, another overblown announcement is near. Several companies, notably Google, IBM and the California-based Rigetti, are racing to build a machine that achieves what is grandly termed “quantum supremacy”. The feat will mark the moment when a quantum computer, for the first time, outperforms the best conventional computers. Google, the frontrunner, could claim the record this year.Quantum computers can solve certain problems much faster than conventional ones. Drug development, materials design, weather forecasts, stock trades – all could potentially be helped by quantum computers that perform scores of calculations at once. Physicists have known this since the 1980s, but have only recently made working prototypes.Google, like its main competitors, is building what is called a “universal gate” quantum computer. It has similarities to a conventional computer, but while a standard computer handles digital bits of 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits which can take any value between 0 and 1. When qubits are connected by quantum entanglement, the phenomenon Einstein called “spooky action at a distance”, such machines can rattle out computations that would take billions of years on a traditional computer. Today’s largest quantum computers have about 20 superconducting qubits. The next generation of chips, those expected to achieve quantum supremacy, will hold at least 50.Quantum supremacy will be a remarkable achievement for science. But it won’t change the world any time soon. The fact is that algorithms that can run on today’s quantum computers aren’t much use. One of the main algorithms, for example, makes the quantum computer churn out random numbers. That’s great for demonstrating quantum supremacy, but for anything else? Forget it.The mammoth task of making the machines useful has been eclipsed by quantum enthusiasm. The Boston Consulting Group drew on more than 100 experts and 150 peer-reviewed publications for its recent report on quantum computing. It sees the first applications coming in three to five years, with quantum computers taking on materials simulations that slash costly, time-consuming lab tests. Further ahead their use will spread, and in future decades productivity gains brought about by quantum computers will top $450bn (£372bn) annually, the report asserts.Well, let’s not get carried away. To compute something useful – say, the chemical properties of a novel substance – would take a few million qubits. But it’s not easy to scale up from 50 qubits to several million. In fact, the challenge is formidable.The trouble is that quantum systems are exceptionally fragile. To maintain their quantum behaviour, qubit chips are enclosed in sealed boxes fitted with vacuum pumps to remove stray air molecules, or cooled to a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. More qubits means more fridges, more connections and more expense. Worse, these devices are exquisitely sensitive to the smallest disturbances – even footsteps can send them awry. Even when housed in far-flung shelters and accessed through the cloud, it is not clear that a million qubit machine would ever remain stable for long enough to function.And that’s not all. Quantum computers are not standalone devices. They need a supporting cast of conventional computers and other devices to program, operate and monitor them. Added to that is the computational burden of the machines output. A quantum computer with 10 million qubits running at a few gigahertz would spew out more than 10 terabytes of data per second. That’s a tsunami of information, more than is produced by Cern’s Large Hadron Collider, and it would have to be handled by conventional computers.Today, a single qubit will set you back $10,000 – and that’s before you consider research and development costs. At that price, a useful universal quantum computer – hardware alone – comes in at at least $10bn. This for a machine whose true commercial value is far from guaranteed. To make quantum computers commercially viable, the cost per qubit will have to drop dramatically. But how this will happen, no one knows. Academics speculate about lumping devices on top of one another, but a report from the National Academy of Sciences is hardly optimistic, saying: “It is not yet clear if or when … these technologies can scale to the level needed” to solve commercially interesting problems.Those in the field put their faith in Moore’s law, the observation by Intel’s Gordon Moore that the number of transistors that can be housed on a chip doubles every year. But Moore’s law is not a law of nature and I see no reason for optimism. For conventional computers, the game changers were semiconductors, transistors and eventually microchips: in other words, quantum theory. Today’s quantum computers are more akin to the tubes and relays of the Eniac era, with no transistors in sight.Researchers need to move on. They must take a good, hard look at the quantum computers they are building and ask how will they make them useful. If quantum computers are ever to help solve humanity’s problems, they will have to improve dramatically. Quantum supremacy will be a landmark for computing, but it is where the hard work starts, not where it ends.• Sabine Hossenfelder is a research fellow at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/721f0366569b285041fc8931fed5197429cfc15d/0_110_5342_3205/master/5342.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db2d282504e9afcf201e3ed504f3fac7","title":"send us a tip on your holiday memories for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Tell us about extraordinary trips, surprises, wonderful excursions, or ones that went wrong … anything that made for a memorable journeyWe would love to hear your holiday memories and mishaps.

The two women were joined by the civil rights icon and Georgia congressman John Lewis and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus.Omar’s comment followed Donald Trump’s racist assertion that she and three other progressive lawmakers of color – representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib, who call themselves the Squad – should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came” despite the fact that they were all US citizens. Subsequently, Trump’s supporters chanted “send her back” after Trump mentioned her at a rally in North Carolina.Pelosi, who has found herself at odds with the progressive members of the Squad in the past on issues such as impeachment, vigorously denounced Trump’s behavior. The House of Representatives swiftly passed a resolution condemning the attack as racist.“Every single member of this institution, Democratic and Republican, should join us in condemning the president’s racist tweets,” Pelosi said on the House floor after the resolution was passed.In her address to the Ghanaian parliament on Wednesday, Pelosi said the delegation’s visit to a fort where slaves had been held was a “transformative and humbling” experience.Ghana’s president, Nana Akufo-Addo, declared 2019  “the Year of Return” – a commemoration that is meant to encourage people of African ancestry to make the “birthright journey home for the global African family”.Omar posted several snapshots from the delegation’s trip, thanking Akufo-Addo for hosting the delegation and committing to “work together to overcome global security and build a more sustainable world to combat climate crisis”.In a statement, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Karen Bass, said it had been “a profoundly significant trip”, adding that it “says a great deal about the historical ties between our countries and reaffirms our commitment to Ghana and to the continent of Africa”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f2f59a2ad472220fdbabaff7dfcaf8cb82287e7/0_8_1691_1015/master/1691.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bef74c196c9bbf75d010466121bd827","title":"inf treaty us russia arms control to end","story":"INF treaty, which kept nuclear missiles off European soil, was ‘an invaluable brake on nuclear war’, says António GuterresThe UN secretary general has warned that the world has lost “an invaluable brake on nuclear war” with the expiry of a cold war-era arms control treaty on Friday.The 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty has kept nuclear missiles off European soil for more than three decades, but the US and Russia have failed to agree on how to keep it alive.“This will likely heighten, not reduce, the threat posed by ballistic missiles,” António Guterres told reporters, adding that he was concerned about rising tensions between nuclear-armed states. There have already been signs of a rekindled arms race in the class of weapons that the treaty banned: ground-launched missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500km.Nearly 2,700 of the cruise and ballistic nuclear missiles were destroyed under the treaty, removing a potent source of European insecurity. A targeted country would only have a few minutes warning of a launch, fueling paranoia and hair-trigger alerts on both sides of the Iron Curtain.These weapons are now beginning to return.“2 August marks the demise of the INF, which played a major role in enhancing stability in Europe,” said Laura Kennedy, the former US permanent representative to the conference on disarmament in Geneva. “Its termination could be both unsettling in Europe and could lead to new arms competition in other areas, such as Asia.”The death of the INF comes amid aggressive nuclear weapon modernisation programmes being carried out by the US and Russia. Among the new weapons the US is contemplating is a nuclear bunker-buster, considered and then shelved under the George W Bush administration.Russia has developed a land-based nuclear-capable cruise missile, which the US and its Nato allies say violates the INF range restrictions. Moscow initially denied the existence of the missile (known as the 9M729 or by its Nato designation, SSC-8) and then claimed its range was under 500km. It is thought likely to be a land-based version of the Russian navy Kalibr missile.“They are dual-capable, they can carry nuclear weapons, they can reach European cities within minutes, they are mobile, hard to detect and they also reduce the threshold of any potential use of nuclear weapons in armed conflict,” the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Wednesday.Russia’s refusal to scrap the weapon led Donald Trump to withdraw the US from the INF treaty, and the US is now developing at least three types of medium-range missiles, all of them designed for conventional warheads.The first of these, believed to be a land-based version of the Tomahawk cruise missile with a 1,000km range, is due to be tested later this month. A second option, a medium-range ballistic missile, is due to be tested in November, with a range of up to 4,000km. Third, the army is planning to develop a new missile to be mounted on a mobile launcher, either a ballistic weapon or a hypersonic glide vehicle.Pentagon officials have said the first weapon, the cruise missile, could be deployed within 18 months.The prospect of the INF’s demise on Friday is viewed with little enthusiasm among UK officials, not least because the country falls in the range of the previously banned intermediate-range surface-to-surface missiles.“It is a proper serious moment,” a Whitehall source observed, although there are no plans for the new administration of Boris Johnson to publicly mark the moment.European officials say there has been limited discussion with their US counterparts on Nato policy after INF, in part because European policy was focused on saving the treaty.Now that that has failed, UK officials argued there was unlikely to be an immediate return to a nuclear standoff between rival missile systems in Europe, as witnessed in the 1980s when US cruise and Pershing missiles were ranged against Soviet SS-20s.The new Russian missile is nuclear capable, but not necessarily nuclear armed. They are presently believed to be organised in four battalions, only one of which is west of the Urals, though they are mobile allowing for rapid redeployment.The US missiles are, for now, strictly conventional and Nato has said it has no intention of deploying nuclear missiles in Europe.“We will not mirror what Russia is doing,” Stoltenberg said.Furthermore, the Democratic majority leadership in the House of Representatives is opposed to the new US missiles, arguing there is no sign of a coherent strategy behind them, and has removed the $96m research and development budget for them from the House 2020 budget. The fate of the programmes now depends on the reconciliation process between the House and Senate versions.It is unclear where a US cruise missile would be based. They would have to be located in eastern Europe to be in range of Russian targets, but one of Washington’s closest allies in the region, Poland, has insisted there would have to be unanimous Nato support for their deployment, which is unlikely.“Any US attempt to force the alliance to accept the missiles or to go around Nato and try to negotiate a bilateral agreement with an inidual Nato member would be a significant source of ision within Nato and one Russia would be eager to try and exploit,” said Kingston Reif, the director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association.Administration hawks led by John Bolton, the US national security adviser, are also eyeing a possible Pacific deployment as a counter to Chinese medium-range missiles. The fact that China was outside the INF was one of the reasons cited by Bolton and others in their opposition to the treaty. But basing problems would also be a serious obstacle in the Pacific, as any host nation would become a primary target for a pre-emptive attack.“Our east Asian allies aren’t exactly rushing to host these these missiles,” Reif said. They could be based on Guam, but that is 3,000km from China, and expose the population on the tiny US Pacific territory.“There is no plan for what comes after INF,” said Pranay Vaddi, a former state department arms control official now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Not having a plan or not at least forecasting that you’re thinking of a plan of what to do for European security and Asian security after the treaty is what strikes me as irresponsible.”After the collapse of the INF, the last remaining arms control treaty is the 2010 New Start agreement limiting US and Russian strategic warheads, but that is due to expire in 2021 and Bolton has said it is unlikely to be extended."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95c76c61a47dd939e6d2512c83ac1e1aa2cf8a70/217_85_1822_1093/master/1822.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=612dc47e5000ae32721d104055f680c6","title":"saudi women can now travel without a male guardian reports say","story":"Women will also be able to apply for passports and register a marriage, orce or birthWomen in Saudi Arabia will no longer need the permission of a male  to travel, according to laws published on Friday, in a key step towards dismantling controls that have made women second-class citizens in their own country.Other changes issued in the decrees allow women to apply for passports, register a marriage, orce or child’s birth and be issued official family documents. It also stipulates that a father or mother can be legal s of children.Being able to obtain family documents could ease hurdles women faced in obtaining a national identity card and enrolling their children in school.Still in place, however, are rules that require male consent for a woman to leave prison, exit a domestic abuse shelter or marry. Women, unlike men, still cannot pass on citizenship to their children and cannot provide consent for their children to marry.Under the kingdom’s ship system, women essentially relied on the “goodwill” and whims of male relatives to determine the course of their lives.Friday’s move comes at a time of increased international scrutiny of women’s status in Saudi Arabia. In recent months, several young women have fled the country and made public pleas for help in seeking asylum from their family and the government. Last year, authorities arrested many of the country’s most prominent female campaigners in a sweeping crackdown on activists.The country’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, has sought to present himself as a modernist reformer since being appointed heir to the throne in 2017. Critics say the jailing of female activists under his watch and the treatment of dissidents, including Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist who was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, suggests the regime only wants change on its terms.Prince Mohammed has brought in sweeping social and economic changes, aimed partly at weaning the country off its dependence on oil revenue. He has also dismantled some of the strictest controls over women. Last year, a driving ban was lifted, and rules were altered freeing women from needing permission from a male  to study at university, undergo surgery or get a job.The crown prince has also curbed the powers of the religious police, who once pursued women they considered immodestly dressed to check they had a ’s permission for their activities. They also broke up mixed-sex gatherings.Those changes were welcomed by activists who say Saudi Arabia’s ship system has kept its women in a legal limbo as “perpetual minors” and should be dismantled entirely.Prince Mohammed has also been criticised for Saudi Arabia’s role in Yemen’s brutal civil war, and his relentless pursuit of opponents at home and abroad, most prominently of Khashoggi. A forensic and damning UN report said  the crown prince should be investigated over the murder because there was “credible evidence” that he and other senior officials were liable for the killing. He has denied any involvement.The rules, approved by King Salman and his cabinet, allow any person 21 and older to travel abroad without prior consent and any citizen to apply for a Saudi passport on their own.The decrees, issued on Wednesday, were made public before dawn on Friday in the kingdom’s official weekly Um al-Qura gazette. It was not immediately clear if the new rules go into effect immediately.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b175f6c2f819898ce708fe52ec6a31226af043c0/0_23_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0e9c9518dec56699e87e141eadae340","title":"north korea missile tests could be effort to divide us japan and south","story":"Three launches in eight days point to ulterior motive amid strained relations between its neighbours and Washington The series of short-range missile tests by North Korea over the last eight days could be an attempt by Pyongyang to exploit strained US-Japan-South Korea relations, analysts have said.The latest launches, at about 3am on Friday from North Korea’s east coast, involved the firing of two unidentified projectiles into the Sea of Japan. They follow two tests in the past eight days.“Maybe North Korea wants to try to push the US back to the negotiating table with some kind of proposal for weakening sanctions,” said Yoichi Shimada, professor of international politics at Japan’s Fukui prefectual university. However, he believed Donald Trump would not waiver on economic sanctions, “despite all the friendly talk about Kim”.The US has been trying to promote unity between South Korea and Japan, its two biggest allies in Asia, in the face of both an unpredictable North Korea and an increasingly assertive and militarily powerful China. The defence ministers of the US, Japan and South Korea held their twelfth joint ministerial meeting at the beginning of June, but relations between Seoul and Tokyo have only deteriorated since.On Friday morning, Japan confirmed it would take South Korea off a “white list” of preferred trading partners, the latest escalation of a trade spat kicked off by historical grievances that date back to the second world war. Japan and South Korea do have an intelligence-sharing pact, but it is unclear how this is being impacted by the current political tensions.“South Korea and Japan are not able to put together a common position, which brings into question the ability of the US to manage north-east Asia,” said Garren Mulloy, professor of international relations at Daito Bunka university in Japan.Pyongyang has suggested the tests are a response to this month’s joint US-South Korean military exercises – something it has long condemned as “invasion rehearsals” – but Shimada points out the drills have already been scaled back.Mulloy sees North Korea’s actions as an attempt to exploit “obvious weaknesses in the US-Japan-South Korea relationship … So Chairman Kim is hoping to make more trouble and demonstrate that he can act with impunity”.Adding to the Seoul-Tokyo tensions, the US president has been critical of the US-Japan security alliance, suggesting its Asian ally should pay more to support the American military stationed on its soil, repeating complaints he made during his election campaign.Trump also dismissed concerns about the latest tests, tweeting they were “short-range missiles” and “very standard”. However, such short-range missiles “are obviously a threat to Japan”, said Shimada, noting that it makes much of the country a potential target.Shimada laments the “defence-only position” of Japan, in line with its pacifist constitution, adding, “and into the bargain has prohibited itself from intelligence operations of the kind Israel has used to damage Iran’s nuclear weapons programme”.Japan and South Korea have both recently-deployed missile defence systems based on US military technology, but analysts say they are far from failsafe and North Korea’s capabilities are steadily growing.The American and Japanese militaries have recognised the threat and are now cooperating more closely than ever on missile defence, with Japan’s air self-defence force recently moving its headquarters next to its US counterpart at the Yokota naval base, south of Tokyo.But as long as tensions between the allies persist, Pyongyang looks unlikely to shift from its current strategy.“North Korea is looking for a window of opportunity, a crack in the door,” said Mulloy. “It is always focused on the US – it’s never really about Japan and South Korea, even when it looks like it is. Everything the DPRK wants is to be treated like a great power by the great power.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3974528.1564681174!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"one in five primary school students in classes of at least 30","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe school with the highest average class size in the country was Scoil Mobhí in Glasnevin, Dublin.

There is no statutory limit here on the size of general classes, although a Department of Education circular in 1990 stated “appropriate learning experience is difficult to achieve when classes consisting of mainly four-year-old children exceeds 25”.Overall, more than 109,600 out of 553,319 registered primary pupils in the recent school year were in overcrowded classes.However, the Department of Education figures also highlighted how average class sizes nationally have been falling since 2015-2016, when they stood at 25.4 pupils per class.They decreased further in the last school year to 24.3, down from 24.5 in 2017-2018, but are still relatively high by international standards.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA Wire A no-deal Brexit could cause cross-border agriculture trade in Northern Ireland to “virtually stop” within 24 hours, according to a leaked UK government document.The document also says a no-deal Brexit could trigger “consumer panic”, food shortages and an increased security threat within a fortnight.The slide, prepared for British ministers and obtained by Sky News, says the pound could fall in the first month, while Northern Ireland may face law and order challenges.Marked “official sensitive” and titled “What this could look like on the ground”, it also warns that UK nationals in the EU could lose access to services and residence rights within the first 24 hours.The leak on Thursday came as Boris Johnson’s government ramped up its rhetoric over leaving the EU by the October 31st deadline, whether a new exit deal is brokered or not.And it was revealed as chancellor Sajid Javid announced £2.1 billion of funding to prepare for no-deal.Bank of England governor Mark Carney also warned that a deal-less break would be an “instantaneous shock” on the economy and cautioned that the pound would fall, inflation would rise and GDP would slow.A second leaked document, this one from the Cabinet Office and seen by , warned of a risk of “panic buying” exacerbating food supply disruption, as well as a threat of civil disorder.Sky reported that its leaked slide was prepared in the final weeks of Theresa May’s tenure as prime minister.PA understands the document was shown to ministers but not signed off by the government, meaning it was not official policy.Potential frictionThe document’s worst case scenarios in the case of no-deal – broken down into first day, first fortnight and first month categories – also included potential friction at sea between UK and EU fishing vessels.It says that, within 24 hours, cross-border agriculture trade in Northern Ireland “virtually stops” as other trade “slows”.In the first fortnight column, it details: “Potential consumer panic and food shortages.”And it warns of a “possible increased risk of serious organised crime, including people smuggling and illegal migration”.The first month could also see heightened policing resources becoming “unsustainable”, as operational gaps in security “continue to emerge”.Questioned on the leak, a No 10 spokeswoman said: “We do not comment on leaked documents.”The prime minister was due on Thursday to chair his first meeting of the Brexit war cabinet – comprising of the chancellor, foreign secretary Dominic Raab, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove, Brexit secretary Steve Barclay and attorney general Geoffrey Cox.On the same day, the Bank of England slashed its growth forecast to 1.3 per cent for both this year and next, down from the 1.5 per cent and the 1.6 per cent previously predicted.Funding packageAnnouncing the £2.1 billion funding package, including £1.1 billion already committed to plans for October 31st and £1 billion in reserve, Mr Javid said it was “vital that we intensify our planning” for the Brexit deadline.Measures in the package include:– £344 million for border and customs operations– £434 million to ensure vital medicines are available– £108 million to support businesses, and– £138 million for a public information campaign to begin in the “near future”The funding will pay for 500 more Border Force officers, improved infrastructure at ports and extra cash for Operation Brock – the plan to cope with traffic chaos in Kent caused by delays at Dover in the event of no-deal.Supplies of medicines could be hit by disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit, so mitigation plans include increased freight capacity, warehousing and stockpiling.Mr Johnson has ordered planning for a no-deal Brexit to be ramped up, even though he has claimed the odds of it happening are a “million-to-one against”.He sent his top Europe adviser David Frost to Brussels to deliver his message that the UK will be leaving the EU on October 31st “whatever the circumstances”. – PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe The Government has decided to put the collection of the TV licence fee out to tender, raising the possibility that An Post could lose the lucrative business.Minister for Communications Richard Bruton will today confirm he has decided to accept the recommendations of the working group on the future of funding public service broadcasting, and will be putting the collection of the TV licence fee out to public tender later this year.The successful bidder will be awarded a five-year contract for the service. In a further reform, once this five-year period has elapsed, the licence fee will be replaced by a “device-independent broadcasting charge” designed to capture households consuming publicly-funded content on devices other than traditional television sets.Mr Bruton said an estimated 10 per cent of homes access content on devices which do not require a licence currently.Collection of the €160 annual TV licence has previously been framed by campaigners and Opposition politicians as key to the survival of the rural post office network. Mr Bruton said the option of purchasing TV licences at post offices will remain regardless of which organisation secures the contract.Minimise evasionThe Minister said tendering for five years will allow the winning body “the chance to invest in a robust collection service” to minimise evasion, which currently runs at an estimated 12 per cent per year.“It is also clear that due to the nature of technological change and the movement towards digital devices, the design of the TV licence fee will have to change. This is a fundamental reform that will take time to develop, but it will future-proof the funding model, taking account of changes in technology and in how content is now consumed.”The tender process is expected to attract significant interest from the public and private sectors. In addition to An Post, the Revenue Commissioners have previously been mooted as a potential collector of the fee.British firm Capita, which collects the fee on behalf of the BBC in the UK, as well as Cork-based Abtran, which runs Irish Water’s call centre, are expected to be in the running for the contract, along with payments firm Payzone. The provision of free TV licences to those in receipt of the household benefits package will continue.Reforms to the licence fee collection model are included in the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill, which is being published on Friday and brought before the Dáil in the autumn. The bill proposes reforms to supports for independent broadcasters and local community radio.Also under review will be the amount set aside by RTÉ for the commissioning of external content. Currently, the national broadcaster makes about €40 million a year available. The review will be carried out between 2019 and 2021.Granting exemptionsLevies on independent broadcasters will be reduced, while the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) will be given greater flexibility in granting exemptions and deferrals from the broadcasting levy. The Bill will also allow for BAI expenses to be part-funded – up to 50 per cent – from licence fee receipts.It will allow for the creation of a new funding scheme which will grant bursaries to journalists in local or community radio stations. Mr Bruton also flagged a review of the Broadcasting Act 2009, which will address the level of funding made available for the Sound \u0026amp Vision scheme. The BAI administers this scheme with the aim of supporting TV and radio programmes on Irish culture, heritage and experience. Currently, it receives 7 per cent of net TV licence receipts, or about €14.5 million.Mr Bruton said that “public service broadcasting is more important now than ever. Independent, objective reporting of domestic and international affairs is crucial. However, we must recognise that the landscape in which broadcasters operate is undergoing a transformation and that this gives rise to new challenges. Audiences are transitioning away from traditional platforms and are increasingly accessing content online through digital mediums.”‘Remit compromised’ In a statement, RTÉ said it had been making the case for reform of the TV licence system for many years, and it has been made in numerous independent reviews.“While this decision by Government to tender for collection services is welcome, nonetheless the decision to defer implementation of a revised media charge system means that the crisis in the funding of public service media will continue. “Latest evasion levels are 13 per cent, significantly higher than in the UK and other European countries. The fact is that the number of homes that do not have a traditional television set - but who are nonetheless consuming public service content - is increasing rapidly and the current television licence fee mechanism reflects less and less how people consume public-service content.“When added to the evasion rate, currently close to 25 per cent of homes are now not paying the TV licence due to an outdated and inefficient system. This is resulting in tens of millions in lost funding for public media and the broader sector each year.”RTÉ said the BAI had recommended an immediate increase in funding of €30million to the state broadcaster it could maintain public services and continue to support the Irish audio visual sector. “With reform now pushed out further, RTÉ’s capacity to deliver against its existing remit is severely compromised.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3974618.1564687890!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"post brexit duty free port network idea condemned by labour","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUK international trade secretary Liz Truss: believes duty-free ports will be the “gateway to our future prosperity”.    Photograph: Jonathan BradyPA Labour has denounced a plan by Boris Johnson to create duty-free ports around Britain after Brexit as a boon to money-laundering and tax evasion that will diminish employment rights. The British government will on Friday appoint an expert panel to advise on the establishment of freeports, where businesses can import, warehouse and re-export goods duty free.The government claims that the ports could be free of “unnecessary checks and paperwork, and include customs and tax benefits” and would boost economic growth around the country. But Labour’s shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said the plan would not bring new investment or growth.“It is a race to the bottom that will have money-launderers and tax dodgers rubbing their hands with glee. Freeports and free-enterprise zones risk\u0026nbspcompanies shutting up shop in one part of the country in order to exploit\u0026nbsptax breaks elsewhere and, worst of all, lower employment rights,” he said.“The British people did not vote for this new administration and they certainly did not vote to see their jobs and livelihoods threatened\u0026nbspin favour of gifting\u0026nbspfurther\u0026nbsptax breaks to\u0026nbspbig\u0026nbspcompanies and their bosses.”Scepticism of expertsTrade experts are sceptical about the value of freeports, which often simply move economic activity from one place to another and do not reduce friction at the border. But international trade secretary Liz Truss said the ports would do for towns and cities across Britain what an enterprise zone in London’s Docklands did for the capital.Freeports would use onshore enterprise and manufacturing as the “gateway to our future prosperity, creating thousands of jobs”, she said.“We will have a truly independent trade policy after we leave the EU on October 31st. I look forward to working with the Freeports Advisory Panel to create the world’s most advanced freeport model and launch the new ports as soon as possible.”The announcement follows a warning from the Bank of England that Britain faces a one in three chance of tipping into recession in the next six months and that a no-deal Brexit would see inflation rise and sterling fall.\u0026nbspSterling lost 4 per cent of its value against the dollar in July, its worst performance in a single month for almost three years.‘Listen to economy’The chief executive of BMW, Harald Krüger, warned Mr Johnson on Thursday to “listen to the economy” on Brexit and to avoid leaving the EU without a deal.“Listen to the economy and listen to the people. You need to have a dialogue, I hope you can come to a compromise that is acceptable to everyone,” he said.Mr Johnson’s government announced an extra £2.1 billion (€2.3 billion) for no-deal Brexit planning, lifting the total allocated by the government to £6.3 billion. The money will pay for extra freight capacity and warehouses to protect the supply of vital medicines, the training of 500 new border officers, support for exporters and a £138 million public information campaign.Labour’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell accused the government of wasting public money in pursuit of what he described as an avoidable no-deal Brexit.“This government could have ruled out no-deal and spent these billions on our schools, hospitals and people,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: BloombergBoris Johnson has been dealt a significant blow after the Conservatives lost the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection to leave the new Prime Minister with a working majority of just one.The Liberal Democrats won the mid-Wales constituency by a margin of 1,425, swinging the vote nearly 12 per cent from the Tories.Mr Johnson’s first major challenge as Tory leader became his first major defeat with the announcement of Jane Dodds’ victory in the early hours of Friday.The Tory loss will add to the prime minister’s challenges to steer Brexit through parliament and may increase the chances of a snap general election.Welsh Lib Dems leader Ms Dodds immediately challenged Mr Johnson to rule out a no-deal Brexit as she celebrated her victory.“There is no time for tribalism when our country is faced with a Boris Johnson government and the threat of a no-deal Brexit,” she said.Boris Johnson“So my very first act as your MP when I arrive in Westminster will be to find Mr Boris Johnson wherever he is hiding and tell him loud and clear: ‘Stop playing with the future of our communities and rule out a no-deal Brexit now’.”She pushed into second place the Conservative candidate Chris Davies, who was the constituency’s MP until he was ousted in a recall petition after he admitted submitting false invoices for expenses.Despite 19 per cent of the electorate petitioning for his recall, the Tories selected Mr Davies to fight to reclaim the seat.The Lib Dems secured 43 per cent of the vote, the Tories 39 per cent and the Brexit Party 10 per cent.Fourth-placed Labour narrowly avoided losing its deposit by securing just over 5 per cent of the share.Newly-elected Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said: “Boris Johnson’s shrinking majority makes it clear that he has no mandate to crash us out of the EU.”The vote may also be seen as an early victory for the “Remain alliance” of anti-Brexit parties, with Plaid Cymru and the Greens agreeing not to field candidates in order not to split the pro-EU vote.Ms Dodds thanked those two parties for their “courageous decision”.Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the “spirit of co-operation” between the pro-Remain parties had led to Ms Dodds’s election, as he called for a second referendum.Beat Brexit“But if the prime minister is intent on a general election, he should know that Plaid Cymru and the other pro-Remain parties are committed to cooperating so that we beat Brexit once and for all,” he added.Mr Davies won the seat from the Lib Dems in 2015 and secured a majority of 8,038 in the 2017 general election.But this was overhauled with a swing to the Lib Dems of 11.96 per cent.The loss leaves the PM with the support of 319 MPs, including the DUP which props up his majority, while opposition parties now have 318.Mr Davies’ recall came after he pleaded guilty in March to submitting two false expenses invoices for nine photographs costing £700 to decorate his new office.He was fined £1,500, ordered to pay £2,500 towards legal costs and told to carry out 50 hours of community service.In his losing speech, Mr Davies thanked his team and family “who have had a difficult time over the last few months”. – PA"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Boris Johnson\u0026#39s majority cut to one after Lib Dem by-election win, as Jo Swinson says party is \u0026#39open\u0026#39 to future election dealsWhaley Bridge: Handful of residents refusing to leave as RAF called in to help efforts to stop dam bursting - latest newsPilot tells how he struggled to stop Cambridge student jumping to her death Saoirse Kennedy Hill, Robert F.

And Twitch, like all apps that allow two-way communication and live streaming, present particular risks to children of being groomed.“These sites need to ensure they are doing everything they can to protect children on their platforms.A Twitch spokesman said: The safety of our community is a top priority and one in which we are perpetually investing.We take any issues or accusations of this nature extremely seriously, and as soon as we become aware of a possible instance of exploitation we swiftly take the content down and report it to relevant law enforcement as appropriate.  The NSPCC’s warning comes as it released the results of a survey of 2,000 11 to 17-year-olds that found one in 25 has received or been asked to send sexual material to an adult online.When compared to the population of more than five million children in the UK of that age, the NSPCC estimates this means up to 201,000 are being subject to attempted grooming. According to the survey, the most common social media sites where children experienced grooming were Snapchat and Facebook, where one in 25 using those networks said they had received such requests.The second most common sites were Twitch and Twitter, with one in 33 reporting having such experiences.As a result, the charity called called for social media and tech companies to share more data with each help catch groomers and disable friend suggestion algorithms for children.Duty of Care campaign | Read morePeter Wanless, NSPCC Chief Executive, said: “The scale of risk that children face on social networks revealed in this research cannot be ignored and tackling it with robust and comprehensive legislation needs to be a priority for this government.   “Tech firms need to be forced to get a grip of the abuse taking place on their sites by using technology to identify suspicious behaviour and designing young people’s accounts with built-in protections.”Following the findings, Antigone Davis, Facebook Head of Global Safety, said: “Keeping young people safe on our platforms is a top priority for us.“In addition to using technology to proactively detect grooming and prevent child sexual exploitation on our platform, we work with child protection experts, including specialist law enforcement teams like CEOP in the UK, to keep young people safe.“Ninety nine percent of child nudity content is removed from our platform automatically.”A spokesman for Snapchat added: “We are concerned that predators are using other, less private, apps to locate potential victims and then steer them to Snapchat or other private messaging platforms. We are working hard to better understand this activity and are collaborating with law enforcement and other industry partners to develop more ways to combat this behaviour.”A spokesman for Twitter said: “Twitter does not tolerate any material that features or promotes child sexual exploitation. Under our child sexual exploitation policy, behaviours such as expressing a desire to obtain materials that feature child sexual exploitation as well as engaging or trying to engage a child in a sexually explicit conversation, are in violation. “We continue to welcome partnerships around the world with law enforcement to continue our rigorous and significantly scaled operations on this type of egregious activity.”Duty of Care CampaignThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

I have no problem. We’ll see what happens. But these are short range missiles. They are very standard.” The comments by Mr Trump, who wants to reach a deal over the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme before the US presidential elections, came shortly after a joint statement by the UK, France and Germany underlining their concern about recent ballistic missile tests. “We reiterate our condemnation of such launches, which are violations of UN Security Council Resolutions,” said the statement, urging Pyongyang “to engage in meaningful negotiations with the US as agreed between President Trump and Kim Jong Un on 30 June.”A new ballistic missile was test launched on 31 JulyThe barrage of North Korean tests follows a historic meeting between Kim and Mr Trump at the end of June on the border between North and South Korea, when they pledged to reignite stalled talks on the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang has since been riled by plans by Washington and Seoul to go ahead with a joint military exercise later this month, which it considers to be a “rehearsal for war.”The timing of the tests coincide with the attendance of Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, at the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations forum in Bangkok, Thailand. Mr Pompeo said on Thursday that he and Stephen Biegun, the US envoy on North Korea, had hoped to meet with a senior North Korean official in the margins of the event, but that the meeting had not materialised.“We stand ready to continue our diplomatic conversation with the North Koreans,” Pompeo told reporters at a joint news conference with the Thai foreign minister. “I regret that it looks like I’m not going to have the opportunity to do that while I’m here in Bangkok, but we’re ready to go.”Japan said on Friday that the new launch presented no immediate impact on its national security. Japan\u0026#39s Shinzo Abe and South Korea\u0026#39s Moon Jae-in, whose countries are at odds over WW2 reparationsHowever, Tokyo opened a new diplomatic battlefront with South Korea by striking it off its “white list” of 27 countries with preferential trade status, a move that will fuel bilateral tensions that began last year over a dispute about World War II reparations. The decision means that South Korea will be stripped later this month of the privileged status that has allowed it to access Japanese goods without cumbersome red tape, reported the Nikkei Asian Review. Hiroshige Seko, Japan\u0027s minister of economy, trade and industry, denied it was an export ban and said the move would simply put South Korea on a par with other Asian economies such as Taiwan. However, Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president, is holding a special cabinet meeting on the issue on Friday and Ko Ming-jung, a government spokesperson warned that Seoul will “sternly respond” to the “unfair decision. South Korea had previously warned that it may reconsider intelligence cooperation with Japan if the diplomatic spat escalates. Relations between the two nations have deteriorated since a South Korean Supreme Court decision last year to award reparations to the country’s wartime labourers at Japanese companies during Japan’s colonial rule, which lasted from 1910 to 1945. Tokyo considers the issue to have been settled under a 1965 agreement and fears the court ruling could open the floodgates for multiple compensation claims.   The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Women still need permission from a male relative to marry or live on their own.A hashtag calling for marriage without a \u0027s consent was among the top trending along with a hashtag thanking the crown prince and another touting the new travel rules.The decrees published on Friday also covered employment regulations that would expand work opportunities for women, who represent a big portion of unemployed Saudis. They stipulated that all citizens have the right to work without facing any discrimination based on gender, disability or age.Saudi Arabia ranked 141 of 149 countries in the 2018 Global Gender Gap, a World Economic Forum study on how women fare in economic and political participation, health and education.Many Saudi officials say the fault lies in implementation and not government policy.Without a codified system of law to go with the texts making up sharia, or Islamic law, the Saudi police and judiciary have long cited social customs in enforcing prohibitions on women. Many aspects of ship stem from informal practice.Mohammed bin Salman has dedicated himself to fixing what extremists broke ... This is not about openness as some call it, it is about equal rights for all, a user called Wael tweeted.The prince has pushed back against the religious establishment, including by arresting scores of clerics and dissidents.Many citizens remain wary of the fast pace of change.We are a Muslim community not a Western one, may God keep our daughters safe from all evils, said Sarah, a Saudi woman in her late 40s who declined to give her surname.Imagine if your girls grow up and leave you and don\u0027t return, would you be happy? she told Reuters.Boris Johnson\u0026#39s majority cut to one after Lib Dem by-election win, as Jo Swinson says party is \u0026#39open\u0026#39 to future election dealsWhaley Bridge: Handful of residents refusing to leave as RAF called in to help efforts to stop dam bursting - latest newsPilot tells how he struggled to stop Cambridge student jumping to her death Saoirse Kennedy Hill, Robert F.

Thai police said they were investigating the cause of the explosions. The Thai government confirmed that a number of small “bombing incidents” had taken place as the city hosts a major summit of Southeast Asian nations, and urged the public not to panic as police tighten security. Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha was told of the bombing incidents and has ordered an immediate investigation, spokeswoman Narumon Pinyosinwat said, adding: “Security measures have been tightened. The public is urged not to panic.” Mr Prayut condemned those behind the blasts. On the bombing this morning, I would like to condemn those causing the situation which destroys peace and damages the country’s image. I have instructed officials to take care of public safety and those affected promptly,” Mr Prayut said.Some explosions were heard at a government office and near at least two other sites near central Bangkok. The Thai prime minister has ordered an immediate investigation into who is behind the blastsThe Nation reported that two explosions took place near the BTS Skytrain Chong Nonsi station.One explosion occurred in front of the King Power Mahanakhon Building near the station and a second in the sidewalk park under the station. Eyewitnesses said a security guard had been hurt close to the 77-storey King Power Mahanakhon building. The area was partly cordoned off as police searched the area.The blast caused the soil from the spot to spill out onto the sidewalk, and a crack to appear in a glass panel at the station.  The BTS station closed its Gates 2 and 4 following the explosions.Police said the explosions happened at around 7am, at almost the same time as blasts at the Government Complex in Chaeng Wattana.Bangkok is currently hosting a regional security meeting of Asean foreign ministers and their counterparts from world powers including the United States, China, Russia and the UK.A senior police officer said two street cleaners were injured by what appeared to have been a homemade bomb in the Suan Luang district.Local news websites showed pictures of them – one sitting on the ground with medics and the other being taken into an ambulance.

Its chief executive and chairman Larry Fink sends out a letter to investors each year in which he espouses\u0026nbspthe virtues of investing in with purpose and an eye on social responsibility.But analysis of the investment giant’s holdings suggests that its rhetoric on climate change risks does not match its actions, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).The researcher and analyst,\u0026nbspwhich receives its funding from philanthropic organisations, calculated that BlackRock’s investments in oil and gas firms have dragged down returns as those companies have destroyed value by failing to properly adapt to climate change.Created with Sketch.Fighting climate change with trees: The facts Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The study undermines arguments from some fund managers that they must invest in oil and gas firms in order to fulfil their duty to act in the best interests of investors.Three quarters of BlackRock’s estimated lost returns have stemmed from just four companies: ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Chevron, all of which have underperformed the market.A fifth company, General Electric (GE), has lost BlackRock investors $19.1bn between 2008 and 2018, when compared to the returns it could have made by investing in shares that performed in line with the wider stock market.BlackRock holds more than half a billion shares in GE which saw an unprecedented $193bn wiped off its stock market valuation between 2016 and 2018.This brutal heatwave is our fault – let’s not forget thatIEEFA attributes much of this collapse in value to the fact that GE failed to anticipate the collapse of traditional fossil-fuel power station construction, a key market for the company which supplies turbines for the plants.BlackRock’s biggest mistake during this period, according to the research, has been its stake in ExxonMobil, which could have netted investors an extra $45bn if the money had been invested elsewhere.BlackRock has consistently maintained that it cannot simply shift funds out of particular stocks because many of its funds are passively managed, meaning that investments are selected by criteria that fit with investors’ needs, rather than having a fund manager who actively picks the shares.But IEEFA argues that peers such as Amundi and Norway’s Norges Bank have developed low-carbon investment strategies that are as cost-effective as BlackRock’s passive investment strategy.As the custodians of trillions of dollars in global wealth, institutional investors are increasingly being called upon to take action to prevent climate change by removing funds from companies who are not doing enough.The problem is more and more being framed as a financial as well as an ethical one.The Bank of England last year estimated that lack of action to move towards a low-carbon future could see up to $20 trillion wiped off the value of assets as they become useless or “stranded”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Brexit turmoil was blamed for the fall, alongside a world economy undermined by trade tensions. On this measure, UK manufacturing has now shrunk for three consecutive months.\u0026nbspDowning Street and the Treasury declined to respond to Mr Carney’s comments, citing the need to respect central bank independence.\u0026nbspBut Peter\u0026nbspDowd, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury,\u0026nbspsaid the inflation report gave “a bird’s eye view of the mess the Tories have made of our economy, with slumping business investment, weak productivity, stagnant pay, and stuttering growth”.And Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman\u0026nbspChuka Umunna\u0026nbspsaid: “It is perfectly clear Brexit is already harming our economy: the manufacturing sector is nearing record lows and the pound is trapped in stark decline. How can the Tory government claim they can end austerity and grow the economy when their policy of Brexit is pushing it to the brink?“The Liberal Democrat message is now more urgent than ever: give the people a final say, stop Brexit, and with the country back on track, fix the economy. Stopping a no-deal Brexit is vital, but stopping Brexit altogether must be the goal.”Labour MP\u0026nbspRachel Reeves, the chair of the House of Commons Business Committee,\u0026nbspsaid it was “pure recklessness” on the part of the government that it had not ruled out no deal.The £2.1bn committed by Sajid\u0026nbspJavid, the chancellor, to no-deal preparations on Wednesday should be spent on reversing benefit cuts and investing in schools and hospitals, “not shoring up the defences against a tsunami”, said Ms Reeves.Minutes of the Wednesday meeting of the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, released at the same time as the forecasts, showed that the\u0026nbspMPC\u0026nbsphad voted unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent.“The\u0026nbspMPC\u0026nbspjudges that underlying GDP growth is likely to remain subdued over the coming year, with Brexit-related uncertainties weighing on spending to a greater extent than in May,” the\u0026nbspBoE\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbspSpeaking to reporters, Mr Carney pointed out that business investment – which accounts for just over 9 per cent of Britain’s GDP – remains low both historically and compared with other countries.\u0026nbspPointing to another constraint on investment that is likely to persist beyond October, he noted that in recent months companies have grown less certain about Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU, with a long-term free trade agreement likely to take “some time” to negotiate. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A section of the dam wall at Toddbrook Reservoir in Derbyshire has collapsed following heavy rainfall in the areaA collapsed bridge near Grinton, North Yorkshire, after parts of the region had up to 82.2mm of rain in 24 hours on TuesdayAcrobats Beren d\u0027Amico, Louis Gift and Charlie Wheeller, from Barely Methodical Troupe perform a routine on Calton Hill in Edinburgh as they bring their debut show Bromance to the Edinburgh FringeTheresa the robotic waitress at The Tea Terrace\u0027s Cobham branch in Surrey.

What they do\u0026nbspknow is that the\u0026nbsproad ahead is\u0026nbsplooking\u0026nbsprockier by the day.\u0026nbspCarney reiterated that the Bank’s forecasts and projections are still predicated on a deal getting done, which is still more or less official government policy. But they’ve been downgraded, in part reflective of the fact that the UK economy has started to seize up as a result of all the uncertainty. \u0026nbspIn the meantime, he and his people have done their best to ensure that, for example, the banking system will be able to cope with the hard shock of a no-deal outcome.

Some of them are showing real signs of strain and, as Northern Rock graphically demonstrated, it only takes a small bank tipping up to create a very big mess.At least consumers are behaving in a “prudent manner”. In other words, they’re being careful not to borrow too much to fund their spending, offering some crumbs to Carney and his colleagues. \u0026nbspBut that\u0026nbspcomfort is slim.

Its chief executive and chairman Larry Fink sends out a letter to investors each year in which he espouses\u0026nbspthe virtues of investing in with purpose and an eye on social responsibility.But analysis of the investment giant’s holdings suggests that its rhetoric on climate change risks does not match its actions, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).The researcher and analyst,\u0026nbspwhich receives its funding from philanthropic organisations, calculated that BlackRock’s investments in oil and gas firms have dragged down returns as those companies have destroyed value by failing to properly adapt to climate change.Created with Sketch.Fighting climate change with trees: The facts Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The study undermines arguments from some fund managers that they must invest in oil and gas firms in order to fulfil their duty to act in the best interests of investors.Three quarters of BlackRock’s estimated lost returns have stemmed from just four companies: ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Chevron, all of which have underperformed the market.A fifth company, General Electric (GE), has lost BlackRock investors $19.1bn between 2008 and 2018, when compared to the returns it could have made by investing in shares that performed in line with the wider stock market.BlackRock holds more than half a billion shares in GE which saw an unprecedented $193bn wiped off its stock market valuation between 2016 and 2018.This brutal heatwave is our fault – let’s not forget thatIEEFA attributes much of this collapse in value to the fact that GE failed to anticipate the collapse of traditional fossil-fuel power station construction, a key market for the company which supplies turbines for the plants.BlackRock’s biggest mistake during this period, according to the research, has been its stake in ExxonMobil, which could have netted investors an extra $45bn if the money had been invested elsewhere.BlackRock has consistently maintained that it cannot simply shift funds out of particular stocks because many of its funds are passively managed, meaning that investments are selected by criteria that fit with investors’ needs, rather than having a fund manager who actively picks the shares.But IEEFA argues that peers such as Amundi and Norway’s Norges Bank have developed low-carbon investment strategies that are as cost-effective as BlackRock’s passive investment strategy.As the custodians of trillions of dollars in global wealth, institutional investors are increasingly being called upon to take action to prevent climate change by removing funds from companies who are not doing enough.The problem is more and more being framed as a financial as well as an ethical one.The Bank of England last year estimated that lack of action to move towards a low-carbon future could see up to $20 trillion wiped off the value of assets as they become useless or “stranded”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Brexit turmoil was blamed for the fall, alongside a world economy undermined by trade tensions. On this measure, UK manufacturing has now shrunk for three consecutive months.\u0026nbspDowning Street and the Treasury declined to respond to Mr Carney’s comments, citing the need to respect central bank independence.\u0026nbspBut Peter\u0026nbspDowd, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury,\u0026nbspsaid the inflation report gave “a bird’s eye view of the mess the Tories have made of our economy, with slumping business investment, weak productivity, stagnant pay, and stuttering growth”.And Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman\u0026nbspChuka Umunna\u0026nbspsaid: “It is perfectly clear Brexit is already harming our economy: the manufacturing sector is nearing record lows and the pound is trapped in stark decline. How can the Tory government claim they can end austerity and grow the economy when their policy of Brexit is pushing it to the brink?“The Liberal Democrat message is now more urgent than ever: give the people a final say, stop Brexit, and with the country back on track, fix the economy. Stopping a no-deal Brexit is vital, but stopping Brexit altogether must be the goal.”Labour MP\u0026nbspRachel Reeves, the chair of the House of Commons Business Committee,\u0026nbspsaid it was “pure recklessness” on the part of the government that it had not ruled out no deal.The £2.1bn committed by Sajid\u0026nbspJavid, the chancellor, to no-deal preparations on Wednesday should be spent on reversing benefit cuts and investing in schools and hospitals, “not shoring up the defences against a tsunami”, said Ms Reeves.Minutes of the Wednesday meeting of the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, released at the same time as the forecasts, showed that the\u0026nbspMPC\u0026nbsphad voted unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent.“The\u0026nbspMPC\u0026nbspjudges that underlying GDP growth is likely to remain subdued over the coming year, with Brexit-related uncertainties weighing on spending to a greater extent than in May,” the\u0026nbspBoE\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbspSpeaking to reporters, Mr Carney pointed out that business investment – which accounts for just over 9 per cent of Britain’s GDP – remains low both historically and compared with other countries.\u0026nbspPointing to another constraint on investment that is likely to persist beyond October, he noted that in recent months companies have grown less certain about Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU, with a long-term free trade agreement likely to take “some time” to negotiate. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A section of the dam wall at Toddbrook Reservoir in Derbyshire has collapsed following heavy rainfall in the areaA collapsed bridge near Grinton, North Yorkshire, after parts of the region had up to 82.2mm of rain in 24 hours on TuesdayAcrobats Beren d\u0027Amico, Louis Gift and Charlie Wheeller, from Barely Methodical Troupe perform a routine on Calton Hill in Edinburgh as they bring their debut show Bromance to the Edinburgh FringeTheresa the robotic waitress at The Tea Terrace\u0027s Cobham branch in Surrey.

compared with the price cap average of £1,254.Suppliers who claim to offer “100 per cent\u0026nbspgreen” energy tend to buy the majority of their electricity on wholesale markets, then buy certificates called “REGOs”, which guarantee the equal amount of electricity created from fossil fuels is matched by renewable generation.However, Good Energy uses power purchase agreements, which involve buying electricity directly from wind farm and solar generators.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.Founder and chief executive of Good Energy, Juliet Davenport, said: “Our tariffs genuinely support the growth of renewables and clean technologies. And because our customers have actively chosen to contribute to that support.“If we are going to tackle climate breakdown, iniduals must be empowered to choose to be part of the solution. We know customers want the ability to make that choice, and recently it has been complicated by energy companies taking shortcuts to offer cheap \u0027green\u0027 tariffs.”Regulator Ofgem had initially given Good Energy a temporary exemption in January when the cap was introduced. This lasted until the end of March, but was extended until September, and was finally made permanent.Ofgem said the decision was made because it recognised customers on Good Energy\u0027s standard variable tariff (SVT) had chosen to be on it, unlike customers who have been on SVTs for several years without necessarily knowing.Officials added that the support for renewables provided by the extra cash is “materially greater” than “regulatory mechanisms”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Manufacturing has now shrank for three consecutive months. The last time managers reported weaker activity was in February 2013.Production volumes hit a seven-year low, dragged down partly because manufacturers sold off stocks built up to prepare for the Brexit deadline of 31 March, said IHS Markit which compiled the data.While some firms were still running down stocks bolstered before\u0026nbspthe original Brexit date, others were re-starting these stockpiling efforts in preparation for the new October deadline, IHS Markit said.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply, said: A killer combination of economic uncertainty and the weakest production levels for seven years, battered the manufacturing sector into contraction for the third consecutive month in July.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A collapsed bridge near Grinton, North Yorkshire, after parts of the region had up to 82.2mm of rain in 24 hours on TuesdayAcrobats Beren d\u0027Amico, Louis Gift and Charlie Wheeller, from Barely Methodical Troupe perform a routine on Calton Hill in Edinburgh as they bring their debut show Bromance to the Edinburgh FringeTheresa the robotic waitress at The Tea Terrace\u0027s Cobham branch in Surrey.

The debate deepened after reports a video had been filmed by private investigators of sex acts taking place in the clubNew orders fell as businesses used up stockpiled materials, EU businesses moved supply chains out of the UK and weakness in the global economy stifled demand from both domestic and export markets.Unsurprisingly the decline in employment levels followed suit with one of the sharpest cuts to jobs for more than six years as businesses hesitated to keep calm and carry on and build staff levels.Employment in manufacturing decreased for the fourth month in a row, with the pace of decline accelerating to one of the highest over the past six-and-a-half years.Demand was weaker from domestic and overseas markets. The decline in new export business mainly reflected lower intakes from the EU and China.The latest\u0026nbspgrim indicator for the UK economy came as Boris Johnson stepped up plans for a no-deal Brexit widely expected to cause significant disruption to businesses and consumers.UK manufacturing output and optimism tumble to multi-year lows – CBIHowever, manufacturers maintained a positive outlook in July with more than 46 per cent expecting output to be higher in a years\u0027 time than it is now, compared to just 10 per cent predicting output will be lower.Managers pointed to new product launches, an expected rebound in exports and reduced uncertainty following Brexit\u0026nbspas reasons to be optimistic.Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit said manufacturers were suffocating under the choke-hold of slower global growth and political uncertainty.“The weak, highly competitive environment makes a sustained revival highly unlikely in the coming months.However, a short-lived bounce leading up to October should not be ruled out, as some manufacturers are already gearing up to re-start Brexit preparations.If so, expect a case of déjà-vu during quarter four, as another correction in inventory holdings hits growth in the lead-up to year-end.The pound sank to a two-and-a-half year low against the dollar on Tuesday.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Enquiries to the Saudi Embassy in Washington DC did not receive an immediate response.Facebook has launched a series of probes into false accounts, an undertaking that has taken on mounting importance in the light of Robert Mueller\u0027s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.In its blog, Facebook said it had been helped in its work by the work investigative journalist site, Bellingcat.The battle over government access to people\u0027s private chatsFacebook says it can read thoughts with mind-reading deviceFacebook Libra scams try to sell cryptocurrency before it even existsIn January, it took down\u0026nbsp 364 Facebook pages and accounts operated from Russia and targeting the Baltics, Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Central and Eastern European countries.Also in January, it removed 783 pages, groups and accounts engaged in “coordinated inauthentic behaviour tied to Iran”,\u0026nbspand 234 accounts, pages and groups on Facebook and Instagram operating as part of a domestic network in Indonesia.In February, it removed 168 Facebook accounts, 28 pages and eight Instagram accounts targeting people in Moldova.

Gone is the ignorant Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) of the original in favour of a hardened badass who returns to the moon, accompanied by a group of space marines, to take on the alien queen. How many years between sequel and original? SevenIt wasn\u0027t until the arrival of Austin Powers sequel The Spy Who Shagged Me that Mike Myers\u0027s comic creations were fully wedged into the hearts of film lovers. If the original was the perfect introduction to Austin\u0027s groovy world, the follow-up was an altogether funnier, bigger and more quotable affair. How many years between sequel and original? TwoCapping off not only your own franchise but a decade-long series consisting of 22 films is no mean feat – and yet Avengers: Endgame balanced all the playing pieces to do so with gargantuan success. How many years between sequel and original? Seven437 Back to the Future Part II (1989)The first sequel to Robert Zemeckis\u0027s Back to the Future is an amusing adventure that sees Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) travel... well, back to the future, to prevent his own son from sabotaging the family legacy. How many years between sequel and original? FourIt was the addition of both Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito – as Catwoman and the Penguin, respectively – that made Tim Burton\u0027s sequel Batman Returns an even more memorable watch than the original. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeEach instalment of Richard Linklater\u0027s Before trilogy is as good as the last. But, if there is a peak, it surely arrives with number two – Before Sunset – which reunites would-be lovers Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) nine years after they first met in Before Sunrise (1995). How many years between sequel and original? NineThere\u0027s a blistering chase sequence midway through The Bourne Ultimatum involving Matt Damon\u0027s amnesiac spy and journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine). It\u0027s adeptly directed by Paul Greengrass – here at the top of his game – and is all the proof you need that the original trilogy improved with each new film. How many years between sequel and original? Five837 Bride of Frankenstein (1935)Depicting Mary Shelley\u0027s classic creature as a pleasant guy just looking for a companion, Bride of Frankenstein is one of the greatest monster movies, let alone sequels, in cinema history. How many years between sequel and original? FourBatman Begins may have been the perfect origin story for the caped crusader, but nothing could have prepared film fans for the classic its sequel would become. Christopher Nolan intelligently crafted The Dark Knight into one of the greatest follow-ups ever made, with several standout action sequences and an untouchable performance from Heath Ledger as the Joker. One for the ages. How many years between sequel and original? Three1037 Dawn of the Dead (1978)George A Romero ditched the entire cast of Night of the Living Dead for its first sequel, Dawn of the Dead, which showed the effects of the zombie apocalypse on a much larger scale than depicted in the black-and-white original. One of the most entertaining horror films ever made.  How many years between sequel and original? 10The glory you feel watching Hellboy II: The Golden Army comes from the knowledge that you\u0027re watching a studio allow Guillermo del Toro to do whatever the hell he wants. A scintillating oddity of a follow-up that surpasses the 2004 original within minutes. How many years between sequel and original? FourNot so much an improvement on the first as one that rips up its rule book completely: Sam Raimi took the character of Ash (Bruce Campbell), who viewers first met in influential 1981 horror The Evil Dead,\u0026nbspand placed him in the heart of what is essentially a slapstick comedy. How many years between sequel and original? SixAfter the lacklustre fourth instalment, Fast \u0026amp Furious 5 was the reinvention the series desperately needed. Bringing in Dwayne Johnson as the bad guy was a genius stroke and the final set-piece – a car dragging a bank vault through the streets of Rio – remains as entertaining as anything the long-running series has ever done. How many years between sequel and original? 10The Godfather Part II set the highest benchmark for what sequels should be, but so rarely are – a crucial chapter in a saga. The film won Robert De Niro an Oscar for his efforts, playing the same role Marlon Brando won an Oscar for two years before. This, alongside another film on this list, is one of two sequels to ever win Best Picture (keep scrolling to find out the other one). How many years between sequel and original? Two1537 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)The fact that Sergio Leone had barely any money to make The Good, the Bad and the Ugly – the third film in his Man With no Name trilogy – fortuitously led to the casting of the relatively unknown Clint Eastwood. Leone\u0027s film, beautifully soundtracked by Ennio Morricone, is a masterwork that proves less is more: its most classic dialogue-free scenes derived from the fact that Leone had no time to shoot dialogue. How many years between sequel and original? Two1637 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)Gone was the warm glow of Hogwarts in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Alfonso Cuarón\u0027s adaptation of the JK Rowling novel proved the franchise could win widespread acclaim, as well as ticket receipts, if put in the hands of interesting directors. How many years between sequel and original? Three1737 How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014)Could How to Train Your Dragon endure as one of the most beloved yet underrated franchises of all time? Quite possibly – and its first sequel, which features breathless flight sequences and animation to marvel at, is solid evidence of this. How many years between sequel and original? FourDespite essentially rehashing the plot of the first film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a bolder, more exciting and, yes, deadlier outing for Jennifer Lawrence\u0027s heroine Katniss Everdeen. How many years between sequel and original? One1937 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)If Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade isn\u0027t better than series opener Raiders of the Lost Ark, it\u0027s certainly as good. This is thanks to the addition of Sean Connery\u0027s Henry Jones Sr – the father of Harrison Ford\u0027s whip-cracking archaeologist. How many years between sequel and original? EightPerhaps it was down to relief that Iron Man 3 was so revered by critics (lest we forget Iron Man 2 is one of Marvel\u0027s biggest duds). But, Robert Downey Jr\u0027s third solo outing as Tony Starl boasts enough laughs and thrills, not to mention a doozy of a twist, that earns its placement on this list. How many years between sequel and original? FiveLethal Weapon 2 takes what made the original so fun – the wit and twist-filled action – and amps it up as far as it can possibly go. That it throws in Joe Pesci for good measure just makes the results even more sizzling. How many years between sequel and original? TwoLogan rectified the mistakes of Wolverine\u0027s earlier standalone films thanks to James Mangold\u0027s decision to place the character in a far grittier film than he was used to (it was rated 15 in the UK). The result remains a perfect send-off to one of X-Men\u0027s greatest characters, who first played the role in 2000.How many years between sequel and original? 17Gareth Evans\u0027s sequel to The Raid is more of the glorious same, only – somehow – more ambitious. Two hours and 30 minutes of breathlessly-paced fight sequences that\u0027s unlike anything caught on film before. How many years between sequel and original? Three2437 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)The second sequel to ever win Best Picture is all about the payoff. While each film in Peter Jackson\u0027s Lord of the Rings trilogy delivers in what it needs to, this final chapter balances all the plates to dish out an epic conclusion that surely would have been everything JRR Tolkien wanted from an adaptation of his classic novels. How many years between sequel and original? TwoNobody could have predicted quite how breathlessly entertaining Mad Max: Fury Road would be. George Miller\u0027s dystopian chase film refuses to relent from the very first second and is just as entertaining with every watch – and far superior to the Mel Gibson original, which was released in 1979. How many years between sequel and original? 36There has never been a bad Mission: Impossible film. However, since Christopher McQuarrie stepped into the fold as director, the series has taken just as many audacious leaps as its lead star, the stunt-loving Tom Cruise. Fallout is a multi-layered, twisty action film that will undoubtedly go down as a franchise classic. How many years between sequel and original? 22All it took was the spirit of Christmas for the Griswolds to get the film they deserved. Chevy Chase heads up this one liner-filled festive treat that\u0027s probably the only Vacation film worth your time. How many years between sequel and original? FourOne critic described Paddington 2 as the Godfather Part II of Peruvian Bear movies and they were not wrong. The sequel somehow manages to convey more charm than the original – which in itself is extremely charming – and has the benefit of starring Hugh Grant as a villainous actor named Phoenix Buchanan. A delight. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeAll eyes were on Shrek 2 thanks to the unprecedented success of the fantastic original, which was released in 2001. What people didn\u0027t expect, though, was that the follow-up would be just as hilarious and even more enchanting. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeSam Raimi managed to outdo himself with Spider-Man 2 (the first one remains a superhero standout) with help from Alfred Molina\u0027s Doctor Octopus and some nightmarish scenes in which the Evil Dead filmmaker delves into his bursting bag of horror movie tricks. How many years between sequel and original? Two3137 Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982)By placing the emphasis on character as opposed to action, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan righted the wrongs of the classic TV show\u0027s first big screen adventure, a dud that was released in 1979. The result is a staggeringly improved follow-up. How many years between sequel and original? thREEThe Empire Strikes Back would make this list for its twist alone, which ranks as one of the greatest in cinema history, but the film also represents so much more. Episode V established the Star Wars franchise\u0027s staying power by proving A New Hope was no fluke. How many years between sequel and original? Three3337 War for the Planet of the Apes (2017)With War for the Planet of the Apes, Fox\u0027s closing chapter of the rebooted trilogy, Matt Reeves delivered a near-faultless arthouse film parading as a mo-cap monkey-filled blockbuster. How many years between sequel and original?  SixIt would have been easy to chalk up 10 Cloverfield Lane\u0027s acclaim to the fact it was a secret up until a month before it was released. The fact remains, though, that this spiritual successor to 2008 found-footage thriller Cloverfield is a gruellingly tense chamber piece that\u0027s even more nail-biting than the first. How many years between sequel and original? EightThose who believed you couldn\u0027t get a more groundbreaking film than The Terminator likely burst a vessel after watching Judgement Day, a sequel that reshaped what people wanted from their action movies forevermore. It did so while subverting expectation in the most simplest of ways – by turning Arnie\u0027s killing machine, the terrifying villain in the first, into a cuddly force for good. How many years between sequel and original? SevenWhen Taika Waititi took the keys to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he walked away with one of its greatest films: Thor: Ragnarok. The finished product is Asgards apart from the first of the hero\u0027s two adventures, starring Chris Hemsworth, that were released in 2011 and 2013. How many years between sequel and original? SixSure, the third and fourth instalments might have the emotional payoffs, but –\u0026nbspthanks to a series of standout scenes (the traffic cone pileup, anyone?) – it\u0027s Toy Story 2 that stands tall as the best of Pixar\u0027s sequels.

Four“It’s sort of sad that the stockholder is now in the room deciding what movies get made…” said Stephan. “Disney’s now taken the cover off, and it’s now in your face: ‘Yeah, we just want to make money.’ That’s disappointing as an artist, from a studio that was founded on originality and art.”He described the film’s voice performances as “weak” and “so wooden” and criticised the new character designs for feeling “too real”.Stephan added: “It reminded me of those old nature films where they would dub the voices over and the lips would move. I thought, ‘Oh, this is really cheap.’ I think it was just too soon for this one.”Why The Lion King is so wrong about the African savannahAnother animator, who chose to remain anonymous, said: “There is a huge resentment against these 3D remakes from the original 2D crews. Maybe if we got any kind of royalties it would be different.”However, some of the original animators disagree. Alexander Williams, who designed Scar, said: “I think some of my colleagues forget that when you work on a Disney movie, you don’t own it. They own it. You get paid to work there, which is a great privilege. It’s an amazing company. You get to work on this great stuff.But when you walk away, it’s their movie and they can do what they want with it.

It is close enough to that star to be in the “habitable zone”.In this region, it is possible for liquid water to exist on the surface of a planet, although further research is needed to find out whether GJ 357 d’s atmosphere is dense and warm enough to host liquid water.“GJ 357 d is located within the outer edge of its star’s habitable zone, where it receives about the same amount of stellar energy from its star as Mars does from the sun,” said Diana Kossakowski, from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, who co-authored the paper in Astronomy \u0026amp Astrophysics.Created with Sketch.Best NASA pictures of the month - July 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A total solar eclipse as seen from the US National Science Federation observatory in the Chilean Andes on 2 JulyA composite image of the Cygnus OB2 star cluster composed of pictures taken by the Isaac Newton Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope on July 24The spacecraft Soyuz MS-13 is launched at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on July 20A copy of LIFE magazine from July 4 1969 signed by Michael Collins is seen onboard the Soyuz spacecraftThe galaxy NGC 1156 which is said to resemble a cherry blossom tree.

compared with the price cap average of £1,254.Suppliers who claim to offer “100 per cent\u0026nbspgreen” energy tend to buy the majority of their electricity on wholesale markets, then buy certificates called “REGOs”, which guarantee the equal amount of electricity created from fossil fuels is matched by renewable generation.However, Good Energy uses power purchase agreements, which involve buying electricity directly from wind farm and solar generators.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.Founder and chief executive of Good Energy, Juliet Davenport, said: “Our tariffs genuinely support the growth of renewables and clean technologies. And because our customers have actively chosen to contribute to that support.“If we are going to tackle climate breakdown, iniduals must be empowered to choose to be part of the solution. We know customers want the ability to make that choice, and recently it has been complicated by energy companies taking shortcuts to offer cheap \u0027green\u0027 tariffs.”Regulator Ofgem had initially given Good Energy a temporary exemption in January when the cap was introduced. This lasted until the end of March, but was extended until September, and was finally made permanent.Ofgem said the decision was made because it recognised customers on Good Energy\u0027s standard variable tariff (SVT) had chosen to be on it, unlike customers who have been on SVTs for several years without necessarily knowing.Officials added that the support for renewables provided by the extra cash is “materially greater” than “regulatory mechanisms”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The birth rate was the lowest ever recorded, when births are measured as a proportion of the total population.“The total fertility rate stood at 1.7 children per woman, lower than all years except 1977 and 1999 to 2002.“The proportion of live births to non-UK mothers fell for the first time since 1990. The stillbirth rate reached the lowest level recorded for the second year running.“There were 657,076 live births last year, the fewest since 2005 and a drop of almost 10 per cent\u0026nbspsince 2012.”Clea Harmer, chief executive at stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands, said: “This continuing downward trend in the deaths of babies before birth is very welcome but, until the figures can be seen alongside mortality rates for babies who die shortly after birth, it is too early to comment on whether we are on track to meet the English government’s ambition to halve deaths by 2025.”Additional reporting by PA\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Manufacturing has now shrank for three consecutive months. The last time managers reported weaker activity was in February 2013.Production volumes hit a seven-year low, dragged down partly because manufacturers sold off stocks built up to prepare for the Brexit deadline of 31 March, said IHS Markit which compiled the data.While some firms were still running down stocks bolstered before\u0026nbspthe original Brexit date, others were re-starting these stockpiling efforts in preparation for the new October deadline, IHS Markit said.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply, said: A killer combination of economic uncertainty and the weakest production levels for seven years, battered the manufacturing sector into contraction for the third consecutive month in July.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A collapsed bridge near Grinton, North Yorkshire, after parts of the region had up to 82.2mm of rain in 24 hours on TuesdayAcrobats Beren d\u0027Amico, Louis Gift and Charlie Wheeller, from Barely Methodical Troupe perform a routine on Calton Hill in Edinburgh as they bring their debut show Bromance to the Edinburgh FringeTheresa the robotic waitress at The Tea Terrace\u0027s Cobham branch in Surrey.

The decline in new export business mainly reflected lower intakes from the EU and China.The latest\u0026nbspgrim indicator for the UK economy came as Boris Johnson stepped up plans for a no-deal Brexit widely expected to cause significant disruption to businesses and consumers.UK manufacturing output and optimism tumble to multi-year lows – CBIHowever, manufacturers maintained a positive outlook in July with more than 46 per cent expecting output to be higher in a years\u0027 time than it is now, compared to just 10 per cent predicting output will be lower.Managers pointed to new product launches, an expected rebound in exports and reduced uncertainty following Brexit\u0026nbspas reasons to be optimistic.Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit said manufacturers were suffocating under the choke-hold of slower global growth and political uncertainty.“The weak, highly competitive environment makes a sustained revival highly unlikely in the coming months.However, a short-lived bounce leading up to October should not be ruled out, as some manufacturers are already gearing up to re-start Brexit preparations.If so, expect a case of déjà-vu during quarter four, as another correction in inventory holdings hits growth in the lead-up to year-end.The pound sank to a two-and-a-half year low against the dollar on Tuesday.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He then disappeared for a while, before coming back to hit\u0026nbspJoe\u0026nbspBiden\u0026nbsprepeatedly over criminal justice reform with some choice language. Booker showed none of the deference you’d expect\u0026nbspfrom a young senator to a veteran politico who served eight years as vice president – at one point dismissing Biden’s “phony rhetoric” – but that ruthlessness made his performance all the more memorable.This wasn’t in the same ballpark as her\u0026nbspperformance in the first debate, where she confronted Biden over bussing. But, after a shaky start where she sounded flustered by Biden’s energetic opening, she regained her footing. There was one uncomfortable moment\u0026nbspwhen\u0026nbspTulsi Gabbard\u0026nbspquestioned\u0026nbspher record as a prosecutor – but she didn’t fold. She’ll mark this debate as a net positive.All polling numbers suggest he’s got zero shot at winning this thing. He’s even widely\u0026nbspdisliked in his own city. But his undisputed strength is in debating. The most striking moment for him came\u0026nbspwhen he\u0026nbspasked Biden whether he tried to slow the number of deportations when he was vice president.“You want to be president of the United States, you need to be able to answer the tough questions,” De Blasio said to Biden. “I guarantee you, if you’re debating Donald Trump, he’s not going to let you off the hook.”After a quiet first half, she managed to hit\u0026nbspHarris harder than Biden did at any point in the evening by pinning her down on her record as California’s attorney general.\u0026nbspIt’s a very fertile line of attack for progressives, though, and Harris knows this. She was prepared, but it was an uncomfortable moment for her.She also used her clout garnered from two tours of duty in the Middle East to good effect, saying: For too long we had leaders who have been arbitrating foreign policy from ivory towers in Washington without any idea about the cost and the consequence the toll it takes on our service members.”He was hit from every angle and simply didn’t appear to have the agility to deal with it. He started off with spark when challenged on his healthcare plans, but fell back to his typical mumbles and stumbles under pressure later in the debate. While Harris converted jibes from the sidelines into jabs at her main rival, Biden found himself becoming the punching bag of everyone from Booker to De Blasio. He was, on more than one occasion, happy to immediately stop speaking when moderators asked him to finish his answer, which is generally the sign of a politician in trouble.She had one of the more memorable lines of the night (promising to deep clean the Oval Office if she became president), but failed to make a significant overall impact. At one point, she appeared to be so caught off-guard\u0026nbspby being called upon by moderators that there an awkward pause of several seconds as she gathered her thoughts. Unluckily for her, when she was getting into her stride on gender equality, the moderators cut her off.He looked like a deer in the headlights in the first debate, and needed a breakout moment on Wednesday night. Repeatedly banging the drum for his $1,000-a-month guaranteed income plan wasn’t close to enough.Considering he’s a rank outsider in the race, with little name recognition, he got a lot of face-time with the American public. He seemed to chip in on almost every exchange for an extended period of time – with his hand in the air like the earnest know-it-all at the front of the classroom. But none of the interventions felt significant enough to cut through at home.Strong on climate, forgettable on most other topics he chimed in on.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Is this national unity?”There are at least 1,000 halal shops and restaurants in the Chinese capital. Some have chosen to replace the Arabic halal signs with ones which use Chinese characters, while others visited by Reuters have simple taped over their Islamic symbols.Darren Byler, an anthropologist at the University of Washington who is an expert on Xinjiang, said China’s Communist Party saw Islamic culture and Arabic as foreign influences outside of its control.“It is also seen as connected to international forms of piety, or in the eyes of state authorities, religious extremism. They want Islam in China to operate primarily through Chinese language,” he said.Uighur Muslim woman tells Congressional-Executive Commission on China she asked Chinese to kill her whilst in detention campZha Xi, from China’s National Erthnic Affairs Commission, would only say the constitution protected the rights of all minority groups and insisted halal regulation was handled by Beijing’s local government.But the Beijing council’s committee on ethnicity and religious affairs also declined to comment, saying there was a national directive on halal restaurants.The expunging of Arabic and Islamic signs marks one of the softer parts of China’s attack on Islam.Human rights groups and the UN have decried the large camps set up in Xinjiang as equivalent to “wartime concentration camps”.Former detainees have spoken of Muslim Uighurs inside he camps being forced to denounce Islam, swear loyalty to the Communist Party and even eat pork or drink alcohol – both forbidden by their religion.The government maintains it is simply attempting to combat Islamic extremist terrorism in Xinjiang.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

North Korea also tested short-range missiles on 4 and 9 May.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Books spill out from the pavement stalls onto the street, where browsers kneel to rifle through an eclectic offering.Gabriel Garcia Marquez sits alongside a book of American idioms. Thick engineering textbooks compete with countless biographies of George Bush and histories of the US invasion. But the street has a story as gripping as any of the books on sale.\u0026nbspReligious books used to dominate the market. Then for years under the rule of Saddam Hussein, the sellers were restricted in what they could offer. “I was jailed for selling ‘The Generals are the Last to Know,’” says one stall owner who goes by the name Haider ‘Magazine’.Created with Sketch.40 books to read before you die Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades.

I see on it people I once admired behave in a way that erases nearly all respect.Intelligent iniduals make comments they would regretthey had been texts to friends, let alone messages to the whole world.People who once seemed judicious in their judgements behave — at best — like scolds, desperately attempting to ­correct the world for not ­holding precisely the same views as themselves.Yet Twitter has the ability to ­highlight at speed problems only ­noticeable at a slower RPM in the real world.One is the uncomfortable, ever-vanishing line between comment and journalism.While this blurring is not completely new, there was a fine example last week.As news of Boris Johnson’s successful Conservative Party election victory broke, Lewis Goodall — Sky’s political correspondent — tweeted a photo of a television autocue with the caption: “So great to share a set with Black Mirror today.”For those unfamiliar with it, Black Mirror is a Netflix series created by the formerjournalist Charlie Brooker featuring ious dystopian fantasy futures.There is not very much for Goodall or anyone  to gain from this observation.It is possible some people saw it and gave a snort of appreciation.Perhaps somebody somewhere actually laughed. But it is unlikely anyone is still roaring, days later, at the brilliance and perceptiveness of the observation.Like most things on social media, the short-term gain is not worth the cost. For a cost there is, paid in public trust evennot by the tweeter.If broadcasters still cared about the editorial independence of their employees, comments like this would not be made by their journalists.For they further reveal what most of the public has come to suspect — that broadcasters presenting themselves as non-partisan in fact hold very clear political views and that these usually veer in a particular direction.Most, for instance, tend not to be enthusiastic Leave voters who secretly admire Prime Minister Boris Johnson and occasionally let this truth slip. Of course, people have always harboured their suspicions.But not until journalists began to freely give away their thoughts on social media was there such a smorgasbord of evidence.For years, Gavin Esler was the apparently impartial presenter of many leading BBC political shows, including Newsnight, holding people to account whatever his own views.This was back when we viewers did not have access to a presenter’s opinions.Instead, we would have to guess from throwaway remarks or how one interview compared with another.After the Brexit vote, however, it became clear that Esler had strong views about British membership of the EU.Then, this April, he announced his membership and candidacy for the pro-Remain party Change UK.In a speech at its launch and in subsequent media appearances, he turned out to be as partial as it was possible to be.Indeed, some of his political interventions could legitimately be described as “foam-flecked”.Are the public to pretend Gavin Esler pre- was a dferent beast from the Gavin Esler of this year Or do we presume he always held certain views and only broke out when there was a chance to express them while standing — as it turned out, unsuccessfully — as a candidate for the European Parliament By following broadcasters on Twitter, particularly from the BBC and Sky, it is clear to see the barrier is eroding for everyone.When Goodall sent his Black Mirror tweet, the journalist Tim Montgomerie tweeted: “Throughout Sky News we have pundits posing as reporters. Neither Sky execs nor Ofcom seem to give a damn.”In response, Goodall’s Sky News colleague Kay Burley went for Montgomerie herself, tweeting: “You’re an absolute disgrace to our profession. Seriously.”It was, as Montgomerie went on to say, a pretty unprofessional response in itself.But he was right. There is something strange about this whole game.Partly it is so eroding to public trust because it all goes in one direction.On one single occasion in recent years has a television presenter let slip a view that did not fall into lockstep with the narrow orthodoxies of the broadcasting class.When ­Politics Live presenter Andrew Neil sent out one tweet last year mocking the increasingly conspiratorial Observer writer Carole Cadwalladr, he deleted the tweet and himself became a news story.There were swt calls for his sacking and the BBC felt compelled to publicly chastise Neil.Though widely considered the country’s leading ­political interviewer, Neil no longer has a regular slot on the BBC.The incident stands out partly because it is so unusual for a broadcaster not to go in one predictable direction, but also because it was clear that a price must only be paid when the opinions are the “wrong” ones.The breaking of the “fourth wall” — which meant impartial broadcasters refrained from veering into personal political expression — has had a damaging effect on broadcast journalism.Just observing what a broadcaster like Emily Maitlis chooses to retweet tells me more than I want to know about her own political views.These retweets go in the usual direction, and it bothers me not a jot where those views dfer from my own.The trouble is they begin to colour the rest of the work.When Rod Liddle appeared on Newsnight and was roundly harangued and insulted by Maitlis, I did not think: “What a tough interview.”Having seen what Maitlis had tweeted and retweeted in recent months, I simply saw the same views played out in the Newsnight studio.There was no mystery, no separation between impartial interviewer and opinionated tweeter.Will this have an impact  My guess is it already has.And when the broadcast media complains about disappearing trust in their profession, remember — they have only themselves to blame.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was clear he had never suffered the injuries he would have suffered had he really been subjected to the acts he claimed had been committed against him.He had never been absent from home or school at the time he claimed he had been abused.Moreover, there was no trace of the two children who Beech claimed had been killed by the supposed paedophile gang.Surely these are the first checks which should have been made before police started raiding the homes of suspects.If there is no sign that the murder “victims” had ever existed, that should have set a very loud alarm bell ringing in the ears of police investigators.Yet on they ploughed, driven by the perverse doctrine that anyone who alleges that they have been a victim of sex abuse must automatically be assumed to be telling the truth.That doctrine was a magnet for fantasists such as Nick, who gain a thrill from putting innocent people through the mill — and who stand to pocket a fortune in compensation.Why on Earth was Beech paid £, by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board before his allegations had been tested in court The top brass of that organisation need to hang their heads in shame.Many people are going to be asking: Just how much more taxpayers’ money has been merrily handed out to “victims” who have been telling fibs Sir Richard has demanded a criminal investigation into the Met decision to raid suspects’ homes without proper evidence.But even without that element of the story, it is a disgrace that no police officer has been investigated for misconduct.Instead, those in charge of the investigation have been rewarded. Senior investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Diane Tudway was promoted to superintendent while under investigation for alleged misconduct in the case, and retired just before Beech’s trial.Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald — who infamously described “Nick’s” allegations as “credible and true” — also retired on a gold-plated pension before the Beech trial began.Ex-Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse, who oversaw Operation Midland, has been booted upstairs to a plum, £,-a-year job at the National Crime Agency.Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has been rewarded with a peerage. What an utter farce his elevation makes of the honours system.Sir Richard said the Met has “sought to protect itself from effective outside scrutiny” over Operation Midland, and claims that during an investigation he oversaw into the operation in , the Met failed to pass on all the relevant documentation.He added: “I remain unable to conclude that every officer acted with due diligence and in good faith.”But most contemptible of all, in a way, is the behaviour of Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson.Without Watson, it is unlikely that Beech’s allegations would have been taken so seriously.It was Watson who invited Beech to his Westminster office, who stoked the political heat and put the pressure on police to take Beech’s allegations far more seriously than they deserved.And what has been his reaction since Beech was found guilty last week  Not to apologise but to claim, preposterously, that he, too, was a victim of Beech’s. Rubbish, Mr Watson.You seized on “Nick’s” allegations because you could see the political dynamite of a case which involved a former Conservative Prime Minister, Edward Heath, and ex-Home Secretary, Leon Brittan.The main victims of Beech are, of course, the men he ly accused of forming a paedophile ring, but we should not forget another class of victims — those genuinely abused and who now might be shy of reporting the crimes against them for fear of being taken to be another Beech.That is part of the long trail of destruction caused by the fantasist. But it was not him alone who deserves to take the rap.Police officers, Watson and the chiefs of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board bear a heavy responsibility for what has happenedOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Worse still, just six months later he filed for orce, with royal sources suggesting that he had become increasingly uncomfortable with the rumours surrounding his stunning bride’s past le.Now the Sultan is questioning whether he is the father of Oksana’s two-month-old son.But just who is the -year-old stunning model who bewitched - and lost - a king Sun Online can reveal Oksana had a dficult childhood - and claims she was whipped by her father.Oksana and the Sultan at their lavish wedding in Moscow in June She was the eldest of three children in her strict Cossack family, and grew up in undesirable Taganrog, a resort on the Azov Sea.Oksana recently revealed her surgeon father Andrey Gorbatenko, , often beat her as a child.“I could feel a whip on my bottom, she recently recalled.My father and also my grandfather are very strict… Honestly, I was afraid of my father when I was a child. Now I understand that only thanks to him was I raised and educated in the best way.In fact there was little to suggest that the young Oksana would go on to captivate a King, describing her younger self as a rule-breaker with “a wonky haircut”.When I was at school, I was a kind of bandit, she recalled. I liked some skaters, bikes, BMX, guys who took part in competitions. I love riding a bike too. I was a good pupil.She added: “To be honest, I was never my schools beauty.It’s a sentiment echoed by her class teacher Tatiana Pirogova.It was a class with very beautul girls who were into the modelling business,” she explained.All of them were tall and had long legs. And Oksana didnt stand out. Compared to other girls she was very modest. She didnt go to any modelling agencies, she was only thinking about studies.Initially her path seemed academic: after leaving school Oksana, who attended a language crammer in Oxford, enrolled at the prestigious Plekhanov University of Economics in Moscow, graduating in .By then she was already working as a model – work which apparently led her to the attention of producers of a Russian reality TV show filmed in Mexico the same year.In echoes of Love Island, the lurid show featured eleven young Russians thrust together at a luxury villa.Among the participants was a woman called Ksenia-Nikol – who shot to fame after being seduced during her first day on set by womanising contestant Elisey Polischuk - and the pair had sex in the pool.There is now speculation that Oksana was actually Ksenia-Nikol - and a fellow contestant seemed to confirm it in an interview with a Russian newspaper.What her future husband knew about his bride’s colourful past remains unclear.While their meeting was initially shrouded in mystery, Oksana recently confirmed that she met the Sultan - who orced his first we in  - at a  jewellery event where she was working as a model.We met in spring  in Europe, she confirmed.  After the event, we went for dinner, where I met a man, and he introduced himself as the King of Malaysia. I took it as a joke and joked back that I was also the Queen of Moscow. We talked all evening and exchanged phone numbers.Footage obtained by Sun Online shows the Russian beauty swathed in diamonds and Colombian emeralds that night.King Muhammad was there on a private visit. Witnesses say that once the monarch had seen Oksana with her royal look, all the other beauties stopped existing for him.The couple would go on to have a whirlwind courtship before their glittering Moscow wedding a year later.Her father Andrey, meanwhile, has revealed how his daughter had telephoned to describe the fateful meeting.The same evening my daughter rang me, he recalled. She said: Dad, I met a man at the jewellery fair. He introduced himself as a king. Shall I continue to stay in touch with him ’’.Her father had told her to ignore his royal status and concentrate instead on what kind of person he is.The couple went on to marry in June  in a lavish ceremony in Barvikha, a ritzy Moscow suburb, home to many of Russias rich and powerful.Oksana converted to Islam, taking the name Rihana Oksana Petra.But it was not enough to reassure conservative Malaysians, who were upset by the brides past as an underwear model.Even so, the couple’s happiness seemed complete when, in May, Oksana gave birth to a son,Tengku Ismail Leon Petra Bin Tengku Muhammad V Faris Petra - known simply as Leon.After the birth, Oksana had expressed the hope on her Instagram account that he would be crowned the ‘crown prince of Kelantan and, Inshallah, the future king of Malaysia.’And in June she posted a romantic picture of the couple on a marble staircase clutching a rose, with a tribute to her good husband.She wrote: A good husband will always support and be nice with his we. Always is interested how does she feel and takes care of her,she is tired.Always % keeps his promises.But last month came the shock news that The Sultan had filed for orce, with a certicate registered on July  in Singapore indicating it came about through the utterance of the word talaq three times - the most severe and irreversible form of orce in Islam.In a further controversial move, the Sultan’s lawyer issued a statement alleging that “there is no objective evidence as yet as to the biological father of the child”.The allegation led Oksana to make a public offer to have a DNA test to prove her baby’s royal paternity.In another twist, the Russian beauty seems to believe her husband  is not behind the orce certicate and that they are still married.Just four days ago she posted a message on her Instagram page stating: When we first learned about the orce news, Leon and I were at our house in Russia. I did not receive any subpoena or court letter.Secondly, my husband is a good Muslim, he would not have done such things without my knowledge.She has also questioned whether the orce is valid, telling a Malaysian news outlet: This is an act of provocation.In this ongoing drama it is unlikely to be the last. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On the front cover she chose a bunch of “inspirational women” who she thinks are brilliant for their work in “consciousness raising”.They’re virtually all extremely affluent slebs who advance their own careers and incomes by occasionally parroting fashionable lefty b*****ks.Quite a few of them, such as the awful, third-ision TV presenter Jameela Jalil, are devoid of any talent at all.In the past, even genuine criticism of Harrynmeg has been met with accusations of racism.According to Harry — who at one time was an amiablerather dim rugger-bugger who enjoyed dressing up in Nazi unorm — many are guilty of “unconscious racism”.In , he complained publicly of “racial over-tones” in comments about Meghan.Listen, Ginge. There are many things I find objectionable about Meghan but nobody here cares that she’s of mixed race.Except maybe for some lefties who can’t stop crowing about “how far we’ve come”.For the rest of us it made no dference at all.Unconscious racism does not exist, by the way, Harry.Racism is something one does deliberately, with wicked intent.There was one inspirational woman missing from Meghan’s vomit-inducing front cover.A woman who knows the meaning of dignity, responsibility and duty and is the perfect role model for Meghan herself.Yes, love — it’s your gran-in- law.

First Aaron persuaded the subjects HE was naked - then that they were missing their clothes. Mind-reader Aaron, , carried out the experiment for Vision Direct as part of its aposGo Nakedapos campaign, which was created to encourage adults who wear glasses to switch to contact lenses during the summer months.  He said: It was an incredible experience hypnotising people into thinking they were naked in Soho square. The reactions from the participants and the public were absolutely hilarious and so ied.

One of dozens of homeless people’s dogs being treated today at a mobile street clinic, Boris the silver Staffie has his temperature taken, heart rate assessed and is given fresh water.Last week’s temperatures nudged C in central London, triggering an emergency weather protocol for homeless people and dogs who are their leline.While public concern for homeless people often peaks in winter, heatwaves are just as dangerous. Dogs on the Streetsvolunteers are out in every weather. “When people have sunstroke, they can seem intoxicated which can be a particular problem for the homeless.    People are quick to make assumptions,” says DOTS founder Michelle Clark, out distributing oral ­rehydration drinks and cooling coats for dogs, and water and caps for humans, on the hottest day ever recorded. If a dog is really struggling, DOTS can admit them to their emergency foster sanctuary. “But most homeless people are clued up about their animals,” Michelle says. “In dficult weather they put their dogs’ needs first.” DOTS works in London, Oxford, Kent, Milton Keynes, Birmingham and Taunton, with more opening soon. “A lot of people are actually on the streets because of their dogs,” Michelle says. “Temporary accommodation often doesn’t accept animals, and they can’t think of giving up the only thing that has never let them down.”  At the makesht veterinary post by Charing Cross police station, ex-homeless volunteer Michael Mulholland, , explains how Dogs on the Streets helped his beloved half-whippet, half-Staffie, Lucky, but ended up saving him too. “I was on the streets more or less since I was , after growing up in care,” he says. “I’ve had Lucky since the day she was born. She’s stuck with me. When I used to live outside the ­underground in Leicester Square, the staff used to bring Lucky food. “A lot of people think homeless people don’t look after their dogs, but sometimes they are all we’ve got. A lot of us are people who don’t mix with others very well. I was on the streets because I came from an abusive family. I had a lot of anger and I just used to let it out.” Michael sought DOTS’ help when Lucky developed a heart problem.  “Michelle told me I needed to sort my le out and they’d sort Lucky out,” he says. “I’m housed now and I’m able to care for my mum who is ill, as well as for Lucky. I talk about my problems instead of bottling things up. I know there’s people that care.” Seven years ago, Michelle stopped to help a homeless man and his dog outside a supermarket in North London. She asked a market stall holder for a box and filled it with treats, toys and a blanket. “Street people are special people,” she says. “They very rarely ask for anything. They’re used to being invisible.” Realising homeless people’s pets were a leline, Michelle started helping more dogs on the streets. But then, in October , a homeless man she had befriended collapsed. When he refused to go to hospital because his dog, Poppy, wasn’t allowed to go with him, Michelle stepped in to take her home. “Poppy inspired me to set up DOTS,” she says.  Michelle started with an outreach programme on The Strand in London in March  with vets carrying ­backpacks. Then, in December , an anonymous benefactor donated a custom-made mobile vet surgery. DOTS’ care extends to extraordinary s – from organising dogs’ funerals to paying for hotels for dogs and owners while they recover from operations. The charity also fosters dogs while owners are in hospital, temporary accommodation that doesn’t allow pets, or sometimes police cells. On one occasion, they even fundraised for a boat to house a dog and his homeless owner. In February, the body of a rough sleeper was discovered by police in London. Next to him was a dog who had refused to leave his side for the previous  hours. Michelle was able to identy the dog as Scarper – and the man as Nick.

Lucy Jane Diep competes with hundreds of others when the bidding process starts every Thursday and ends in the same way. The -year-old tries to apply for a new house in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, every Thursday when the bidding process starts. Lucy revealed that she often doesnapost even get the opportunity to bid because there are so few homes big enough to house her, her partner, and her three children. Social housing in the borough is allocated through a scheme called Rochdale HomeChoice, run by housing association Rochdale Boroughwide Housing , Rochdale Council and other agencies. HomeChoice applicants are assessed according to their housing need, given a priority band and advised what size of home they are eligible for. They are then able to bid on up to three homes per week - with the person in the highest priority band chosen.  Lucy, a full-time mum, lives in a two-bedroom house in Deeplish with her partner and three children. She said she is only eligible for a four-bedroom house so there will be periods of up to six weeks in a row when she is unable to even bid. Lucy said: So I will bid on any house I am eligible for no matter the area but when I check I don’t even come in the top  and there are always hundreds of bidders trying to get the same house. In my opinion there’s not enough houses. It’s hard to saythe system is working but for me it isn’t. It is very frustrating. It’s hard as well - five people living in a two-bed house. More homes are needed, that’s all I can think that can help solve it - or [they need to] get private landlords on board with cheaper rents so that it’s not just council or housing association houses you can bid on. Lucy is not alone.  Within just one hour of the bidding cycle opening one week in June, there were already  bids across  properties in the borough. Towards the end of the cycle the following week, a total of , bids had been placed - an average of over  per property, with one house receiving over  alone. Just three of these properties were in Rochdale town centre - and they had an average of more than  bids each. Nicola Wood has lived in Rochdale for  years - first with her parents and then renting privately, until now. Along with her husband, Nicola originally wanted a two-bedroom house for her two children but was told because she was renting privately and not homeless, she would not be a priority. Nicola said: “Time went by, I had another child and again pushed the housing as three children in a two-bed house was really hard. Especially having to sleep in my living room on a blow-up bed heavily pregnant was taking its toll on me when I was working  hour shts in the bookies.” Nicola, who now has five children and still lives in the same two-bed house, said the bidding process has aposbecome my nightmareapos. She says she has been waiting for a house for  years.  And to make matters worse, her family face losing their current home in the next few years as the landlord plans on taking it back. Nicola said: Housing associations’ priorities are terrible to the point where I may as well be in a tent. I’m sure I will find one bigger than our home. It’s soul-shattering waking up to new houses added and  people have already bid so you have no chance of getting a viewing. Everyone deserves a home. I have a roof above my head but me and my children have never had a home. That’s sad for my kids and I know they’re going to have the same problem. Since becoming a mutual housing society in , RBH have administered the council’s allocation policy, as well as running the homeless service on their behalf. RBH said it recognised the current system aposcauses anxiety and frustrations for many peopleapos and acknowledged aposthere is not the right mix and quality of homes to meet current need and demandapos. An RBH spokesperson said: The council’s allocations policy covers homes owned by RBH and those owned by the other main housing associations with homes in the borough.

She said: People think it’s just a word when they are being homophobic but it’s more than that. It’s part of our identity and it’s not acceptable to call people names and things because of their race and religion, so why do people think it’s acceptable to target someone because of their sexuality  People think being gay or lesbian is a lestyle choice but it’s not. Nobody would choose a lestyle where they are subjected to hate and it just makes you wonder what this world is coming to when people can’t even go to the shop without being subjected to homophobia.

It was from Kevin Churchill, a businessman she had recently met online. “Good morning beautul. How are you ” it said. Excited to hear from him, Sharon quickly replied. What Sharon did not know, however, was that the message was not from a businessman and he was not called Kevin. In fact, he was not a person at all. Instead, Kevin Churchill was a dating profile set up by a gang of ruthless criminals, specically designed to rinse money from vulnerable people online. Tomorrow, six people will be sentenced and face up to  years’ jail for romance fraud offences after persuading Sharon and another woman to hand over almost a quarter of a million pounds. Detective Rebecca Mason, of Surrey Police, said: “This is the first time a gang has been convicted of this type of crime.”  Before meeting “Kevin” online, Sharon had been single for  years after the break-up of her marriage. Sharon, , who lives in London and works in property, says: “Three people in my office had met their partners online, so I thought it was worth a shot.” In October , she set up a profile on a site for older daters and two weeks later matched with Kevin Churchill. She says: “The initial message was low-key. It just said he liked my profile and askedI’d be interested in chatting.” Before long she and Kevin were exchanging messages every day and he started dropping hints he was wealthy. Sharon says: “It said on his profile he lived in Cha. Later, it said Chiswick. I asked why he’d changed it, and he said women were always after his money.” Kevin asked Sharon for her number and they started texting and phoning. “He sounded very well-spoken, which fitted with what he’d told me,” she says. Soon after, Kevin sent flowers. She says: “I couldn’t believe that, after all this time on my own, I’d found someone who wanted me.” They arranged to meet in the November, but at the last minute Kevin cancelled due to a business trip.  She says: “He told me he ran a company that supplied medical equipment all over the world, so travelled regularly.” A few weeks later, he asked her to lend him money. She says: “He said his dog was in kennels as he was away, and he needed someone to pay an £ vet bill. He told me he couldn’t transfer the money himself because he banked with Coutts. “I’d never heard of Coutts, but when I looked it up, I saw only the creme de la creme bank there.” She transferred the money and even though Kevin never met her toit, they carried on chatting over Christmas and more requests for money came in. Kevin told Sharon he was in Haiti and needed funds for ­transport and legal fees. She says: “Looking back, I wonder how I could have fallen for it. But it’s human nature – we all want tobe with somebody and to be loved by somebody.” Sharon paid him the money, drawing on her savings. As time went on, she had moments of suspicion. She says: “Some of his messages had an aggressive tone. To test him, I asked questions I’d asked earlier, like the name of his dog.

The human-monkey embryos, in which human cells are added to the monkey embryos, were created by researchers in China. They hope the breakthrough will eventually create an endless supply of human organs for transplants. But critics have warned that the scientic development will create disturbing dilemmas over the ethics of human-animal hybrids. The project was led by Spanish scientist Juan Carlos Izpisua in a laboratory in China, project collaborator Estrella Nunez told El Pais .The team was made up of members of the Salk Institute in Calornia, US, and the Murcia Catholic Universityin Spain. Nunez, a biologist and vice chancellor of the research team at UCAM, said: The results are very promising. Izpisua said: From UCAM and the Salk Institute we are now trying not only to move forward and continue experimenting with human cells and rodent and pig cells, but also with non-human primates. Our country is a pioneer and a world leader in these investigations. Nunez said the team has created an mechanism aposso thathuman cells migrate to the brain, they will self-destructapos. The experiment raises ethical issues as other scientists fear the stem cells would develop a human central nervous system in the animal.    Doctor Angel Raya, director of the Barcelona Regenerative Medicine Centre, told El Pais: What happensthe stem cells escape and form human neurons in the brain of the animal  Would it have consciousness  And what happensthese stem cells turn into sperm cells  The controversial research is restricted in Spain and is only allowed for investigating into deadly diseases, therefore the team decided to work in China to avoid legal issues. Despite this the research was largely funded by the UCAM, it is a project that costs hundreds of thousands of euros, Nunez is quoted as saying. She added: The ultimate goal would be to create a human organ that could be transplanted, but the path itself is almost more interesting for todayaposs scientists.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining.

For that reason and for the second year running we are providing £, of funding. We know our funding last season allowed well over  young players to receive new strips in the Red Star design and attend events across the UK and we look forward to watching their developments over the next season.#Ben Tustin of the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre was equally delighted and said that the Ardrishaig Community Trust #is an excellent partner for us without which we would not have been able to deliver many of our strategic objectives. We are wholly dependent on external funding and volunteers and we do receive generous funding from other organisations as well as the Trust.

Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"districts","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPreserving historic KilbrideA GoFundMe donation page is making the rounds after community group Friends of Kilbride made a plea for funds to preserve historic Kilbride.Kilbride, located three miles south of Oban, includes the ruins of a th-century church, Clan MacDougall’s memorial aisle and an extensive graveyard dating back many centuries.

Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing. With navigator Ian McCulloch, his biggest problems were brake related but with some fluid changes and adjustments it was just all back to normal for the team finishing a well-deserved th overall and fourth in class.Kayleigh Strachan in the Citroen Saxo finished th in class on the event and th overall but managed to pick up  points and th in class in the STRC.Gary Coutts in the Fiesta commented after the final stage on the Sunday that on the second to last stage of day one he developed a few ‘minor’ issues. A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall. A great result for the team with no damage or mechanical issues to report.Class  had four teams registered in the STRC this year at Mach  but only one managed to finish.

It would be hard not to notice the single imposing figure of the dersquoil amongst the floral sea of youngsters.John Cockburn, clad in a black cloak and hood, carried the fiery red head of the dersquoil mounted on the top of a stout pole draped in red cloth. Itrsquos an eerily unnerving sight that Irsquom sure sent shivers down the spine of many since it was carved in .To the sounds of the pipes and trumpets, local bands joined the parade which halted briefly near the top of Waverley Road for Dux Boy Aaron Glendinning to hang a wreath at the wall plaque commemorating John Euman, who acted as Master of Ceremonies at the Cleikum for almost  years.This ceremony was repeated at the plaques on the wall of the Burgh Chambers to former Games Chairman Walker McLaren and John A Anderson, one of the instigators of the Cleikum Ceremony.An act of kindness was carried out at the end of the parade as children handed their flowers to committee members which would be delivered to local hospitals.The procession, which opened the nd Anniversary of St Ronanrsquos Border Games, took the form of a massed bands display. St Ronanrsquos Silver Band and Peebles Burgh Silver Band combined to present a most impressive march along Innerleithen High Street just after the Race Roond the Toon.Large crowds lined both sides of the High Street to witness this spectacle. The march played was The Pride of Princes Street. Huge crowds gathered on both sides of the street to support both of Innerleithenrsquos fine bands and to enjoy the music at this yearrsquos Beating of the Retreat.Presiding over the performance was the President of St Ronans Border Games Alan Patterson along with St Ronan and the Dux Girl, Standard Bearer Ronan Caine and Lass Caitlin Urquhart, their supporters, Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James, and his we Sarah, the monks, and the dersquoil.The two town bands marched on together under the expert direction Band Sergeant David Lindsay playing Scotland the Brave. The Pipe Band then performed an excellent Drummerrsquos Call followed by the traditional Retreat marches Greens Hills of Tyrol, The Battles Oer and Lochanside.Next the Silver Band played an upbeat version of the Queen hit, Fat Bottomed Girls which featured one of the bandrsquos percussionists, Cameron McCreadie, on drum kit and soprano cornet player, Simon Railton, as soloists.The Pipe Band followed on with a rendition of their new competition medley set comprising a iety of time signatures, featuring an emotional arrangement of the slow air Mingulay Boat Song.More marches back and forth had the crowds clapping and tapping their feet before it was time for the combined piece, which was a beautul arrangement of The Rose of Kelvingrove featuring Pipe Major Gillie as soloist. The Silver Band then rendered Sunset with Callum Anderson and Callum Robb sounding the calls. The hymn tune Eventide was played by principal cornet player, Callum Robb, and conducted by Band Secretary Keith Belleville.Games President Alan Patterson then gave permission for the Bands to take their leave. To resounding applause, the bands marched off playing On, StRonans, On!.There was only one important task that remained, the matter of the dersquoil. We were honorary torch bearers lighting the way for our neighbours the St Ronanites, to burn an effigy of the dersquoil.I quickly ran to the High Street for a prime view of the black cloaked carrier of the dersquoil, monks dressed in their habits chanting and punching their croziers in the air, Standard Bearer Ronan carrying the Blue Banner. The magic of this ancient tale was brought to le. I can only compare it to watching the village mob with torchlights off to kill the beast in the classic Disney film.The friendly Innerleithen mob halts on Hall Street and the dersquoil strangely disappears out of sight.I think of the Cleikum Ceremony and remark to my husband, who carried out the duties of the Dux Boy in, how nice it is that the old customs and traditions exist today, said exactly as it was since its inception in .He recalls word for word the outgoing speech of the Dux Boy which makes me think back to the words of Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James: ldquoInnerleithen and the Games will be in your DNA forever. Never a truer word. You can take the man out of Innerleithen but yoursquoll never take Innerleithen out of the boy!We begin the climb of Curly Hill to the soul-stirring sounds of the Pipe Band. It is dark and the fire-lit torches have been extinguished. The climb feels never-ending and locals start to sing On St Ronanrsquos On. We finally reach the top and, as I look out over the valley, it is simply breathtaking. Some things are better felt that telt.My eyes are drawn to the dark figure that sits on the pyre. A haunting figure approaches bearing a flame, St Ronan has ed in the form of Aaron Glendinning. The pyre bursts into flames and the crowds on the hillside cheer the effigyrsquos fiery demise. Fireworks then light up the dark sky.The dersquoil is now in ashes and the evil spirit has been banished once more. And I, along with the people of Innerleithen, head safely home after truly enchanting evening."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclists-set-leg-lavender-touch","story":"A CYCLING team which has raised tens of thousands of pounds for charity is preparing for its toughest challenge yet.The Over The Hill cyclists are in serious training ahead of their  Border Settlements which will see them complete  miles over three days.The nine-man team - which includes Keith Irvine, Stevie Halls, Sinclair Paterson, Ronnie Murray, Josh Irvine, Kevin Mania, Alan Brown, Doug Welsh and Chris Lightfoot - are tackling the route for the Lavender Touch, a charity which raises funds for people in the Scottish Borders living with cancer.The team have previously cycled  miles from Settle in Yorkshire to Galashiels in aid of Prostate Scotland in , and  miles for the Rowan Boland Memorial Trust in .Stevie Halls said: \"The team, which has an age range of mid-s to over , will be passing through over  towns, villages and hamlets in a journey of  miles across the Borders.\"The route mirrors the geographic reach of the Lavender Touch and although our trip will only last three days, the impact we hope to raise through sponsorship and donations will allow the Lavender Touch to continue to support patients for years to come.\"We will be supported across the Borders by a tour bus which will follow the route and stop off at many towns and villages where the Lavender Touch volunteers will be holding a number of events to promote the charitys work.\"The cyclists head off on Friday, August  and hope to reach Gala Cricket Club before the close of play on until Sunday, August .Local businesses can advertise on the side of tour bus -interested, contact Keith Irvine .Donations can be made to the Over the Hills team at www.lavendertouch project over_the_hill_elite_riders "},{"url":null,"title":"garden-delights-opens-peebles","story":"A NEW community garden in Peebles was officially opened last week.Tesco store manager Tracy Wilson was given the honour of cutting the ribbon at the Gutterbluids Societyrsquos Dovecot Community Garden.A grant from the Tescos Bags for Help scheme along with local donations helped fund the project on land at the junction of Dovecot Road and March Street.Andrew Fraser, secretary of Peebles Gutterbluids Society told us: \"The project would not have been possible without a pound grant received from Tescorsquos Bags of Help Scheme, and the firmrsquos willingness to allow the project to go ahead on their land.\"The pound grant, plus a few generous local donations, paid for the  small, ornamental trees which were required for the garden.\"Tescorsquos local Community Champion, Pauline Weir, was very supportive of the project and was keen that bench-seats should be included in the plans.\"Two bench seats were also donated by local iniduals and have been refurbished, plus two new seats were kindly donated, one by the Rotary Club of Peebles, and the other by private donors.\"Gutterbluids Society members and a few friends planted out the five groves of trees early last December.And each of the saplings was in blossom this spring.As well as its aesthetic appeal the new garden is also benefitting nature.Mr Fraser added: ldquoThe grass in amongst the tree groves has been left deliberately to grow, providing a natural area for pollenating insects, etc, and a surprising number of wild flowers are growing there.\"Our bench-seats are proving popular, - and not only for human use.\"As a result we have had to install lsquopigeon perchesrsquo behind two of the seats, in a bid to stop them perching on the seat backs and defacing them.

people to recycle more and litter less.Figures published by environmental body Zero Waste Scotland, revealed the scale of plastic bottle dumping in the Scottish Borders.And how it will be reduced by Scotlandrsquos forthcoming depositscheme.Every year, people in the Scottish Borders go through . million plastic bottles.And an estimated , of those plastic bottles are littered around the Borders each year.Under the new scheme, shoppers will pay a p deposit when buying drinks purchased in single-use plastic, glass bottles, and aluminium or steel cans.People will then get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling.That p is hoped to give people an extra incentive to recycle their empty bottles and cans, and make people think twice about dropping them.With a p incentive not to throw away your empties, Zero Waste Scotland anticipates a  per cent reduction in litter for the materials mentioned.This would mean nearly , fewer plastic bottles dropped in Scottish Borders each year.With plastic bottles only one of the materials included in the scheme, the overall impact on litter is expected to be even higher.Jill Farrell, Chief Operating Officer, Zero Waste Scotland said: ldquoOur new figures reveal how Scotlandrsquos Deposit Return Scheme could visibly slash the number of littered plastic bottles in the Borders.ldquoWe all hate seeing empty bottles and cans littering our streets, green spaces and beaches.ldquoAnd the great thing about Scotlandrsquos Deposit Return Scheme is it will give people a p incentive to do the right thing with their empty bottles, take them back for recycling, rather than risk them ending up on our streets or in our rivers.ldquoLitter isnrsquot just an eyesore ndash it also pollutes our environment and seas.ldquoAnd for every bottle littered, more plastic must be created, generating more planet-damaging emissions.ldquoWhen you take back your empty bottles to be recycled, yoursquoll not just be getting your p back, yoursquoll be doing your bit in the fight against the climate emergency.All types of drinks in containers between  ml and  litres in size are included in the Deposit Return scheme.Across Scotland, wherever people can buy a drink in a container made from one of these materials, they will also be able toit to reclaim the deposit.Online retailers will also be included in the scheme, ensuring

The dancers fought every inch of the way to put our small town on the map.Our thanks once again to the following: MACC, Tangy Wind Farm, West Kintyre Wind Farm, Killieguer Caravan Park, DM Fabrication, Glenside Tractors, Howdens, Kintyre Youth Fund, McFadyens Contractors, Tesco Bags of Help, Jim Martin Supplies, Southend Parish Church, Peter McKerral  Son, C’town Co-Op, C’town Running Club, C’town Rotary Club, C’town Firemans Club, C’town Motor Co, C’town Rotary Club, C’town Loyal, C’town Common Good Fund, C’town Inner Wheel, C’town Community Council, Paul Grumoli, Mr and Mrs Brown, Mr and Mrs Russell, and Laura and Jake, Tesco Staff.Yours,James McCorkindale,McCorkindale School of Dancing.Sir,On Monday evening, July , five sacks of tin cans had been placed in the clear glass bin in Tesco#s car park. Some sort of gathering must have taken place over the weekend. You cannot run a countryyou can#t distinguish between a glass bottle and a tin can.At least something sensible is going to be done about the Rest and Be Thankful road. It was acceptable to try to prevent the hillside from being washed onto the roadway. It has been obvious for several months,not years, that that was not possible.At last someone has seen thata wide trench is dug between the hillside and the road, the hillside can still be washed down but will not reach the roadway.Yours,James W Mackay,Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"carradale open basks in sunshine","story":"The club welcomed  golfers to play in the recent competition which was sponsored by Carradale Bay Caravan Park.Results: Handicap:  A Robertson,  G White,  R McConnachie.

actions.It now aims to take this further and bring this ethos into the surrounding community.The children were given the chance of addressing the meeting, which included ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell and Neil Gilbert, to ask questions and discuss the best ways to engage young people with what is going on in the community and to ensure their input is noted.The children asked about the plans for the site of the former Cockenzie Power Station and whether more activities for young people such as Rainbows and Scouts could be introduced to the areaWhen addressing the councillors and community councillors, Daniel, a house captain from St Gabrielrsquos, said: ldquoItrsquos important for us at this stage to know what our future is going to hold, and to try and make a dference when and where we can.ldquoTo be involved in the community council in some way would be fantastic, as it would give us comfort to know that the community is being taken care of, as well as what decisions were being made that might affect us.It was decided that the community council would send the agenda for each meeting to the school a few days before the meeting took place so that the children could see it and comment on any issues being raised.The community council said in a statement: ldquoWe would like to thank the four fantastic pupils from St Gabrielrsquos Primary School who attended the community council.ldquoIt was so refreshing to have such polite and knowledgeable young people along to one of our meetings to share their opinions and views on our agenda topics and ask the questions they feel most relevant to their lives.ldquoWe look forward to welcoming them along to future meetings and collaborating with them on the issues that affect all of us living in

to gear people up for his show.Were you interested in dinosaurs as a child Not just dinosaurs, but anything prehistoric. My first fossil find was on a beach near where I grew up. I was five years old and was on a day out with mum and dad. We wound the fossilised shell of a belemnite, which was a relative of the squid we see alive today. It was over  million years old and that blew my socks off! It made me start questioning where all these ancient animals went, why we donrsquot have dinosaurs around now and how the planet could be so old. Obviously, I loved dinosaurs too and loved reading about them in all my old books, imagining what it would be like to see a T. rex walking through my garden.Why are so many children obsessed with them So many people are obsessed with dinosaurs, both kids and adults alike. Itrsquos hard to pin down exactly why we love them so much and I think itrsquos for a few dferent reasons. First of all, when we are growing up we love to learn lots of facts about things . . . the speed of fast cars maybe or the size of planets in space. Dinosaurs are the same and we love to learn how fast an Allosaurus could run or discover which was the biggest. I also think they inspire us through being so big, fierce and scary but we feel safe because we know dinosaurs can never hurt us because theyrsquore all extinct You are described as an lsquoevolutionary biologistrsquo ndash what exactly does that entail Irsquom a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of East Anglia. Sounds fancy doesnrsquot it but itrsquos the coolest job in the world. The lsquoBiologyrsquo bit just means I get to study all sorts of le ndash it could be anything that is alive or was ever alive, so anything from a chimpanzee or a Troodon, to a butterfly or monkey puzzle tree. The lsquoEvolutionrsquo bit means I study how these living organisms change and adapt over time. How does a changing marine environment affect sharks or how does predation from birds affect camouflage in lizards  All these changes are down to evolution. I study le and how it changes, and I share that knowledge with as many people as possible. Being a scientist means you get to study cool stuff like this every single day.How many books have you written I have written six books so far. My series lsquoSo You Think You Know About Dinosaursrsquo are pretty cool, evenI do say so myself. I wanted them to be the most up to date dinosaur books in  million years and although I wanted them to be enjoyed by young readers, the content should be the same as that which I teach to university students. I know young readers really want to learn and we donrsquot need to dumb stuff down, but with a few more cartoons, quizzes and examples, I think they can be enjoyed by young and older readers. Each book focuses on just one species and it was so hard to pick just six. Eventually, I chose Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. Therersquos something there for everyone and between them, these dinosaurs really tell the complete story.Herersquos something we all want to know ndash which dinosaur would have been the most dangerous to humans Arrrrrgh, this is such a tough question. Is one T. rex worse than one hundred velociraptors  Even something like a Triceratops could have been deadly. Itrsquos easier to say which dinosaurs would have been safe . . . there wouldnrsquot have been many. Stegosaurus had tail spikes around one metre long, Ankylosaurus had a tail club which could have destroyed a car and Argentinosaurus weighed so much that yoursquod definitely want to be stepped on. And theyrsquore just the herbivores! Imagine what the meat-eaters would have done.And which was the very biggest Ah, this is a question I get asked a lot. There has been huge debate and even some arguments between scientists. Irsquom not going to give it away ndash yoursquoll have to come to my show and find out. Irsquoll give you a clue . . . itrsquos not the one you think it is.What dinosaurs would have roamed around this country many millions of years ago This is a really hard one to answer for each show right now. We had so many prehistoric species that wersquore spoilt for choice now. We had giant sauropods up on the Western Isles in Scotland, early relatives of T. rex in Wales and even the fish-eating Baryonyx on the Isle of Wight. There are also discoveries of marine reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and super-predator pliosaurs all around our coastlines all the time. The best thing to do is get out there and go have a look or visit your local museum and discover what used to swim, fly, run and plod around near where you live, millions of years ago.Were numbers declining before whatever environmental catastrophe wiped them out about m years ago and would they have become extinct naturally No, they werenrsquot. The Cretaceous period was the third major period of the dinosaurs and they were doing really well. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs were around right about the time when the asteroid struck. It was also the age of the titanosaurs ndash the biggest dinosaurs to ever live. If that asteroid hadnrsquot crashed into the sea just north of Mexico then in all likelihood, things might have been very dferent and you might really have had a Tyrannosaursus in your garden or a Protoceratops in your playground. But remember, the asteroid did not kill all the dinosaurs . . .Have you ever been on expeditions to find dinosaur remains and where are the places most likely to find them I have. My favourite was when I went with Sir David Attenborough to Argentina to film the discovery and excavation of a true dino giant. The great thing about loving dinosaurs and living in the British Isles is that we have so many fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. There are certain beaches and riversides famous for fossils and you have a very good chance of finding the fossil bones of a prehistoric marine reptile or shark teeth or ammonite shells. You always have to go with an adult and thoroughly plan your trip because fossil hunting can be dangerous but itrsquos so much fun.Do you identy at all with lsquodinosaur expertrsquo characters on film or television There have been some well-known characters on TV who study dinosaurs but usually theyrsquore rubbish. Look at Ross from Friends . . . Irsquom pretty sure he couldnrsquot tell the dference between the head and butt of a Dreadnoughtus. Characters like that donrsquot inspire me. Real scientists are much better and inspire me every day. The men and women who spend their lives digging up fossils and investigating how these animals and plants lived are much cooler than a TV character."},{"url":null,"title":"music-fan-kevin-proves-39-s-popmaster","story":"Kevin OrsquoDonnell stole the show when he appeared on PopMaster on BBC Radio .A score of  out of  was enough to win the quiz on Ken Brucersquos show.Kevin, who runs his own joinery and garden business, told the Courier: ldquoIt was something that I always wanted to do.ldquoI am right into my music and PopMaster is probably the premier music quiz in Britain.The -year-oldrsquos opponent managed a score of , with Kevin declared the winner and receiving the prize of a digital speaker in the shape of an old-style microphone.The prize has taken pride of place in Kevinrsquos West Barns home, with dozens of people getting in touch with him to offer their congratulations since the show was broadcast.He said: ldquoI met Bruce Springsteen in  in Newcastle and I think this is not quite up there with that but it is not far off.The popular radio quiz has been running for a number of years and each contestant is asked  questions based on popular music from the s through to the present day.He said: ldquoI have listened to Ken Bruce for a good  or  years and the last couple of years I have tried to get on the show.ldquoMy kids have always been saying to me to go.ldquoMy son, Conor, is the lead guitarist in The Tesla Coils and we are always discussing and talking about music.The music fan, who spoke to the Courier as he was en route to see American rock legends Kiss perform at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, played down his achievement and said the questions simply fell in his favour.ldquoYou can get a possible  points thatrsquos the maximum you can score, said Kevin. ldquoThat is based on  questions and it is just general music knowledge.

And would you recommend it to your friends back home  The answer to this one, however, was an emphatic ldquonon.Why  The trains, of course. Rickety, overcrowded, overbooked carriages, lack of luggage space, uncomfortable seats, catering that comprised of crisps and instant coffee, inadequate windows, overgrown trees making visibility dficult, service cancellations their list of complaints was extensive. The rolling stock, they said incredulously, was little better than that used on the local network in Glasgow, despite the journey from Mallaig to Glasgow taking five and a half hours.My heart sank. Irsquod tried to warn them that the trains would not be up to European standards, but they were aghast at the reality. ldquoWhat a terrible waste of incredible landscape, they kept saying. I was ashamed but couldnrsquot argue with a word of what they said. Irsquove taken the West Highland Line three times in the last five years and had passenger experiences that range from not as bad as Irsquod feared, to bloody awful. The staff who work on the trains are pleasant and stoic, but the trains themselves are an embarrassing disgrace.Greatest railway journey on earth  Hardly. That the landscape is breath-taking and spectacular isnrsquot in question. Glimpsing white sandy beaches and shimmering sea through the mountains on the approach to Mallaig is one of lersquos great experiences. But when yoursquore assured a more comfortable ride with better visibility and catering on the local rail network in Munich, something is fundamentally amiss.Read more: Row over -day closure of West Highland LineTo think that Scotland is letting its visitors down in this way, not to mention the communities that would see such economic benefit from a well-served West Highland Line, is frustrating and depressing in equal measure, especially since rail tourism, with its cleaner environmental footprint, is surely the future.Not that the state of trains is putting tourists off. Indeed, the global trumpeting of Scotland means passenger numbers are rising on all branches of the line Glenfinnan station saw a  per cent increase last year. Tourism has never been more valuable to the Scottish economy, bringing in upwards of poundbn a year, with visitors from Europe and the US flocking here off the back of a cheap pound and TV shows such as Outlander.But the more visitors that come, the more ill-equipped ScotRail will be to give them a pleasant journey on the West Highland Line. Improvements have been promised many times over the years but come to nothing. A few extra services have been put on in summer, and some new carriages with better luggage space are apparently in the offing. But better trains with improved seating and windows, and locally-sourced catering, are still nowhere to be seen, despite being mooted after Abellio was given the rail franchise in October .To be fair, ScotRail can only work within the financial confines of its contract. And a painfully slow-moving Transport Scotland review of the line is charged only with exploring improvements within current levels of investment. Itrsquos also worth pointing out that the line is old and remote, which limits the type of trains that could be run, and the Highlands has long been at the back of the queue when it comes to rail upgrades.Whatrsquos needed now, then, is a far more ambitious improvement plan for the West Highland Line, one that includes infrastructure boosts for the communities along the way as well as fully-staffed, modern trains with viewing carriages, comfortable seating and a high-quality catering offering serving tasty local produce. In other words, the sort of trains that are the norm on scenic journeys in Germany, Switzerland and France. How did they get such trains  By making public transport and tourism a political priority.If the political will existed in Scotland to raise the funds and bring stakeholders together, the West Coast Line could have the best trains in Europe. Are you listening, SNP Government  You canrsquot just blame ScotRail and Westminster-all need to work together forchange.Boris Johnson makes his first Prime Ministerial visit to Scotland today, fresh from backing a high-speed rail link between Leeds and Manchester. He could do worse than trying to win over his many detractors here by promising the Scottish Government the sort of funding that could transform our rail infrastructure. And first in the queue for investment should be the West Highland Line. Without it, this jewel in the crown of Scottish tourism can never be a truly great railway journey."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Judge society by how happy we are  not how wealthy","story":"The merest glimpse of the lives of moguls, oligarchs and millionaires tells you that. Are the faces staring out from the pages of glossy magazines shining with wellbeing  They might be tanned, toned, and expensively exfoliated, butany of these iniduals has a heart full of joy, it is unlikely to be as a result of their lestyle.In a recent talk, Nicola Sturgeon made an appeal to commonsense, stating what, deep down, most of us already know. She claims that when calibrating a countryrsquos standing and success, gross domestic product is not the most accurate measure. Not least among the misleading factors when using GDP as a guide is that its figures ignore unpaid carersrsquo work, yet put a value on illegal drug consumption. Just as worryingly, says Ms Sturgeon, ldquoIt values activity in the short term that boosts the economy eventhat activity is hugely damaging to the sustainability of our planet in the longer term.The First Ministerrsquos laudable aspiration is that ldquothe objective of economic policy should be collective wellbeing ndash how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy a population is. Hoping to establish a fairer and truer scale of assessment, she is collaborating with the prime ministers of New Zealand and Iceland ndash women all, in charge of countries geographically on the fringes, who are prepared to challenge convention.Cynics might, of course, say that Ms Sturgeon is simply laying the groundwork for another independence bid, in which those predicting dire financial consequences will be brushed off as old-fashioned and out of touch by placing too much emphasis on our economic prowess. Yet with Brexit, not just economists but rabid Leavers acknowledge that orce from the EU will cause financial shockwaves. Clearly, this is a risk they think worth running. By the same token, idealists north of the Border, who want us to exit from the UK, often say that the possibility of diminished economic performance after independence would not in itself be a deal breaker. There are bigger issues at stake.That argument is for another day. At this point, were Scotland to become a pioneer in putting a fairer society ahead of a more affluent one, this would represent nothing less than a second enlightenment. The inequalities in health and housing, education and attainment that are nakedly apparent all around us, are shaming for one of the wealthiest countries in the world. No matter how much those at the top make, or how vibrant our financial markets, poverty and desperate hardship for too many people persists. Itrsquos tempting to think that those who see GDP and similar indices as telling the whole story have also embraced the biblical creed that the poor will always be with us ndash in other words, there is nothing we can do about their plight.While the SNP has not been far-sighted or proactive enough to combat the recent shocking rise in drug-related deaths, many of them linked to deprivation and hopelessness, nevertheless Ms Sturgeon and the like-minded leaders with whom she is allied, have a strong social conscience. If the message that money is only part of the equation takes hold, it could potentially prove a turning point for the way all rich societies see, and regulate, themselves.Naturally therersquos a danger when writing disparagingly about high-income earners of appearing either green-eyed or preachy. Despite spending a childhood in the pews, hearing how the widowrsquos mite was as valuable as the millionairersquos cheque, and that those who are hard up today will be blessed with eternal treasures in the hereafter, I nevertheless know that no pair of rose-tinted spectacles can make a terrying bill, an unattainable holiday or too-expensive winter coat, one bit easier to bear. As Mae West put it bluntly: ldquoIrsquove been rich and Irsquove been poor, and rich is better.When it comes to wellbeing, you donrsquot need a carbon monoxide monitor to recognise that the air in Stornoway or St Abbs is far better for us than that in the throbbing financial hearts of Edinburgh or Glasgow, or for that matter Tokyo and New York. Wellbeing consists of something way beyond liquidity, location, or assets. Those in their gated communities, who store their Cartier watches in a vault, have cut themselves off from the rest of society. Is that really enviable  This is not to say they might not be really decent, kind-hearted people who give generously to good causes. Perhaps some of them are. But no matter how open-handed they appear to be, money creates a spiralling gulf between the haves and the have-nots, and sometimes cause rts much closer to home, as family lawyers will attest.Far from solving the problem by capitalistsrsquo pet theory of ldquotrickle-down, too much capital at the top of society actually entrenches inequality. Thus, the endless pursuit of higher incomes, pricier properties, competitive conspicuous consumption, whether at a personal or national level, is intrinsically unhealthy. Once you believe that the GDP graph should show an inexorable year-on-year increase, you become blinkered. This is as true, I suspect, for those running the country as for the inidual.Hunger for amassing hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the power that comes with it, is a recipe for potential disaster. It is psychologically and spiritually corrosive. Slowing the Gradgrind pursuit of ever-greater productivity, focusing on more nourishing and longer-lasting priorities, is a way of calling time on the fallacy that the bottom line is all that matters, and that cash is king. It is a way of taking an ethical stance, and saying enough is enough. How to calculate what constitutes enough, of course ndash be it income, savings, love, leisure, charity, you name it ndash is even harder than measuring happiness.Read more: Scotlands history has lain in the British shadow for too long"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10212492.jpg?type=article-full","title":"dont-miss-fantastic-hidden-gems-throughout-angus-fife","story":"BalbinnyLooking for somewhere luxurious to stay in the Angus countryside  - then look no further than the stunning Balbinny.Situated in rolling farmland between the market towns of Forfar and Brechin, Balbinny benefits from -degree views across the River South Esk towards the Angus Glens, and onto the Cairngorms.A development of luxury self-catering accommodation all with master bedrooms featuring super king sized beds, flat screen televisions and bi-folding glass doors, treat yourself to luxury in the heart of the countryside.Complemented by an award winning swimming pool, spa and fitness suite - make the most of your stay by indulging in one of their therapeutic treatments.Tempted  ndash Grab pound off  nights or more between    -    and quote lsquoHeraldrsquo.Tel Email info@balbinnywww.balbinnywww.balbinny news-and-offerswww.facebook balbinnyInstagram balbinny-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Burntisland Golf ClubDating back to , the original Burntisland Golf Club is officially recognised as the tenth oldest golf club in the world.

Witnesses say they saw a number of gold miners ndash who want to expand their operation into new sections of the Amazon rainforest ndash enter the protected reserve of the Wajapi community and stab their leader to death.This is not an isolated incident, but the latest in a pattern of violence and intimidation. Intimidation that is intensying as a result of Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, and his policy of opening up the Amazon, the lungs of the planet, to further exploitation. The ancestral homes of the indigenous people are to be cleared.:Boris Johnson to chair first Brexit strategy meeting as no deal plans get poundbn boostWill today be the day we reach  degrees  That was the question being asked on news and TV outlets in the UK last week, just as mining assassins had struck down an indigenous leader in the ever more desperate and rapacious pursuit of profit.It is not a great leap to join these two dots. As the UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet said, the mounting violence against indigenous communities is clearing the way for ldquofurther destruction of the rainforest, with all the scientically-established ramications that has for the exacerbation of climate change.As Emryarsquos bloodied body was dumped in a river, a message was being sent. Move off these lands, or die. And with the death of the flourishing of these forests, the climate emergency ratchets up.Bolsonaro is keen to steam roller new tracts of the Amazon. As the director of the Amazon Watch Program, Christian Poirer has said, ldquohis regimersquos reckless policies and its wanton neglect of threatened forest communities is directly linked to rising violent criminality. When he is accused of pursuing mass deforestation, and of covering up for the violence against the peoples living in the Amazon, he simply says it is a lie.But he also wants to disarm criticism ndash in a dictatorial fashion. Since coming to power, he has dismantled government departments who focus on climate change. He has promoted climate change deniers to the highest offices.As soon as he came to power, he signed an executive order that handed the regulation of protected Amazonian lands to the Agricultural Ministry, which is dominated by agri-business interests.Bolsonaro has also displayed a long track record of anti-indigenous sentiment, once commenting: ldquoItrsquos a shame that the Brazilian cavalry wasnrsquot as efficient as the Americans, who exterminated their Indians.The disaster being visited upon Brazilrsquos , indigenous people is a disaster for the world. This is one consequence of the election of Bolsonaro.Last year, I went to Rio and Sao Paulo during the election to speak to activists and to report back to meetings in Scotland on the situation there. I met with campaigners and watched the results come in with hundreds of Fernando Haddad supporters, the candidate up against Bolsonaro. People held on to one another as it became clear, as expected, that Bolsonaro was going to win.:Boris Johnson accused of bias toward DUP on Northern Ireland visitThe very next day, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Sao Paulo and cities across Brazil. In an act of courageous defiance, they made clear they would resist the new regime.I spoke to activists about their plans. ldquoThe initial task is to survive, so we are organising solidarity networks, said one. This response was unsurprising. Attacks against LGBT people were a result of the huge propaganda effort waged by the Bolsonaro campaign.Marrielle Franco, a left-wing councillor in Rio, was shot dead months before. Her face now adorns walls across the city as a reminder of the violence of the forces of reaction in Brazil, as well as resistance unbowed in the face of aggression.I noted two days after the election: ldquoGunmen have attacked an indigenous Bororo village in Mato Grosso do Sul. The attackers destroyed the whole village. This is to clear the way for mining and logging. Clearances for the corporations to move in.Thus, the response from the boardrooms and the ideologues of global capitalism to the election of Bolsonaro was quite dferent from that of the rainforest defenders. The Wall Street Journal backed him to the hilt. He was the choice of the international markets. And more recently, the EU struck a Mercosur trade deal that is catastrophic for the environment. The deal negotiated by the European Commission, has been lauded as historic by Bolsonaro.The deal sees a trade in ldquocows for cars, whereby the EU gains access to markets for cars and other products and services with eliminated export taxes, infor Mercosur countries gaining access to markets for beef, sugar and other goods.Cattle farming is the single biggest contributor to the deforestation of the rain forest. Some  per cent of deforested areas in the Amazon are a result of commercial animal pastures. The deal incentivises the destruction, and it legitimises and entrenches Bolsonarorsquos approach.But that is nothing that wordsmith advocates of corporate globalisation cannot make sound progressive. As the Commissioner for Trade Cecelia Malmstrom put it, the agreement ldquobrings Europe and South America closer together in a spirit of cooperation.This is the internationalism of the neoliberal oligarchy. It is a faux internationalism that exists to perpetuate the elevation of corporate interests over the needs of people and planet.Emrya Wajapi is his name. Found murdered in a river, he and hundreds of thousands like him, are the last line of defence in the Amazon. Ranged against them ndash the violence of men desperate for gold and treasure. A regime that sees them as a pest to be eradicated. And a world system that elevates short-term profit above all .But the rivers are rising. And as the temperatures rise with them, it is time to turn up the heat on capitalism itself. Then we might rediscover the kind of internationalist spirit neededwe are to prevent our own extinction."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-grateful-leader-vision","story":"Her belief that the happiness and health of a population must be a major consideration when deciding government policy and practice flies in the face of the ideology of traditional Conservative administrations at Westminster. In this century David Cameron and Theresa May have fronted UK governments that have, unashamedly, put the interests of their party first and protected those with vested interests at the expense of wealth distribution and fairness. With Boris Johnson at the helm there are signs that the doctrine of conscience-free libertarianism will be further emboldened following a No Deal Brexit which will cripple the country and the vast majority of its people but buttress the wealthy both economically and politically.Dominic Cummings, senior adviser to Mr Johnson, very recently said that, in the view of the public, Tories do not care about poor people or the NHS. Whilst this statement could well be another part of his grand election strategy to stimulate debate, it is nonetheless true that societal isions have been accentuated under the Conservatives.Ms Sturgeon has introduced a Benthamite dimension to the national discourse at a time when clarity is most required regarding the nature of our values and what sort of country we wish to live in. She will, almost certainly, come in for criticism from political opponents for hypocrisy or idealism or both.A genuinely Utilitarian society may be a Nirvana in many ways, but it is greatly encouraging that we have a First Minister who possesses the ability to convey her vision, display her humanity and provide sound leadership at this juncture of unprecedented national crisis.The well-being and happiness of Scotland may well rest on her guidance in the weeks and months to come.Owen Kelly, Stirling.THE letter from James Martinis one of the best examples I have encountered of the use of the word hyperbole. We have ldquocringeworthy, whinging, victim persona, suffer, hate-filled, nationalist faces, screaming, foul mouthed, abuse, misappropriated Saltire, intolerant, ignorance, wanton display of boorishness, nationalist, nasty creed. My goodness, what side of bed did Mr Martin arise from that day The cause of this unmerited fury is the performance of Ian Blackford at Westminster and the crowd outside Bute House for the visit of Boris Johnson. I would commend to Mr Martin several viewings on the BBC Parliament channel of Scottish Questions at Westminster, where he will see behaviour from the non-SNP benches to which most of the above words could be applied, so in addition to hyperbole I see hypocrisy.The visit to Bute House by the PM has been well reported and televised by the media and is still available. After several viewings myself, I see an orderly crowd protesting with the booing being louder than the cheering and all in very close proximity to the PM and FM. What were the police thinking about in letting ldquohate-filled nationalists from both sides so close I take particular issue on Mr Martinrsquos comment on the waving of the ldquomisappropriated Saltire. The Saltire cannot be misappropriated by anyone, it is the flag of Scotland and may be used by those who wish to use it. That the SNP and independence supporters use it is perfectly natural. The fact that Scottish Unionists and especially the ldquoProud Scot iety choose not to, is their decision. We hear about Scottish Unionists rooting for Scotland too and so they should, but the Unionist peg is so shoogly they cannot bring themselves to wave the flag of their home country in ldquoour precious Union ndash shame on them.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.I WOULD point out to James Martin that the demonstration in Edinburgh was a peaceful one which left Boris Johnson in no doubt of the strength of feeling regarding Scotlands desire to remain within the EU, and the ultimate horror of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Martin reminds us that the new Prime Minister wasnt \"duly elected other than by a coterie of like-minded iniduals\" but that \"in the UK system the party given the majority chooses who will be PM, not the electorate\". Indeed, but Scotland hasnt chosen a Conservative government since the s, and as Scotland has but  MPs, Wales , Northern Ireland  and England , it is clear that under the UK system everyone gets the governments England elects, and Scotland is facing the unpalatable prospect of leaving the EU because England voted to leave. An affront to democracy which deserves to be protested against.Ruth Marr, Stirling.THE SNP and their apologists tell us on an almost-daily basis that Scotland did not vote for a Conservative government. Figures for the  Holyrood elections and  general elections show that SNP votes were . per cent and . per cent respectively indicating that the majority of Scots voters didnrsquot vote for an SNP Government. They complain that Scots didnrsquot vote for Boris Johnson, conveniently forgetting that Nicola Sturgeon was not voted in by the Scottish voters but simply took over from Alex Salmond when he stepped down after losing the  Independence referendum. The same people tell us that Scotland is being dragged out of the EU against its will. The EU referendum was a UK-wide vote with the result being binding on all parts of the UK. The SNP doesnrsquot accept this.In the  independence referendum  out of  Scottish council areas voted no to independence, so by applying SNP logic it would be reasonable for those council areas voting no in any future referendum to be allowed to remain within the UK. Then again the SNP does not do logic: but it does hypocrisy and cant extremely well.Donald Lewis, Gford, East Lothian.I WONDERit has occurred to Nicola Sturgeon and her party that the reason why they no longer have a majority in the Scottish Parliament, and lost so many seats at Westminster is because the Scottish electorate do not agree with their policies, especially that of seeking to break up the UK.Most people are now weary of reading in the newspapers, and hearing on radio and television of the latest rants and moans from Nicola Sturgeon et al.It would not surprise meBoris Johnson found his recent visit to the RN nuclear submarine base at Faslane less grim than that to Bute House.Robert I G Scott, Fe."},{"url":null,"title":"lewis-capaldi-refers-noel-gallaghers-third-world-country-comments-a-lovers-tiff","story":"The singer-songwriter had been involved in a public spat with Gallagher in recent weeks after the rocker claimed not to know who the chart-topper was as he decried the state of modern music.Gallagher also said Capaldis homeland, of Scotland, was \"like a Third World country\" and compared the singer to Star Wars character Chewbacca.:Irn-Bru cancel Noel Gallagher after he brands Scotland a third world countryCapaldi, who topped the charts for several weeks this year with his debut album, has now said Gallagher is a \"lovely man\" after meeting him recently.Asked about the feud, the -year-old musician told Capital Breakfast with Roman Kemp: \"I wouldnt call it a feud, Id call it a lovers tf.\"Referring to his appearance at Glastonbury Festival, where he came on stage wearing a bucket hat and Oasis-style green coat over a T-shirt embellished with Gallaghers face inside a heart, Capaldi said: \"I dont know who wants to see beef between me and Noel Gallagher but, yeah, he said some unfavourable things, did Noel, and I responded by getting my hair cut like his brother and dressing up like his brother and wearing a shirt with his face on it with a love heart on it.\"It was a whole thing, I tell you something, the beef was raw, it was some raw beef.\":Noel Gallagher: Scotland like a third world countryFollowing his Glastonbury stunt, Capaldi donned a mask of the Wookiee for his set on the main stage of TRNSMT in Scotland.The Someone You Loved singer added that he was \"so pleased\" to be involved in the spat with Gallagher.\"Growing up, part of loving Oasis, part of growing up and being an Oasis fan was loving all the slams that he used to dish out,\" he said.\"So I used to grow up and watch these compilation videos of Noel Gallagher slagging off artists, and now I can be part of one of those compilation videos.\"On meeting his sparring partner, Capaldi said they had a \"big hug\" and that Gallagher was \"into it\".\"This is the thing, right - he bloody ... he loves me,\" he added.:Liam Gallagher weighs in on Noels third world country comments\"Im trying to work outI can send him a plaque for the album.

too tricky or time-consuming for mere mortals.And the other is at the very heart of the natural world towering forests that play a vital role in capturing carbon, harbouring wildle, providing playgrounds to be explored at leisure and wood to make use of.While on the surface there may not appear to be much to connect the high-tech world of robotics with the nationrsquos lush woodlands, however, rising demand for millions of new trees to be planted has sparked a call for a fresh, innovative approach.:Professor Rebecca Lunn : Independent experts needed to help solve lsquoenergy quadrilemmarsquoFaced with the loss of two-thirds of available seed due to weeds, pests, drought or failure to germinate, Forestry and Land Scotland has launched an lsquoInnovation Challengersquo offering funding for ideas to improve the yield from Scotlandrsquos existing tree seed stock.It has suggested that solutions could come from a range of modern technologies ndash including robotics, automation, imaging technology and physical or chemical treatments.Doug Knox, for Forestry and Land Scotland, said: ldquoEveryone knows that planting trees is probably the simplest, most effective method we have of tackling the global climate emergency through the transformation of greenhouse gases into solid, sustainable and renewable materials for construction and manufacturing.ldquoThe demand for young trees in Scotland in  was more than double what it was a decade ago. We will have to double it again within five yearswe are to meet our climate change action plan commitments.ldquoAnd the Committee on Climate Change has called for the amount of tree planting to increase even further.:Scotlands industrial wastelands to be turned into forestsHowever, he pointed out that it is not simply a case of planting more trees. ldquoGrowing trees is actually a tricky business, especially in the early stages. Most tree species used in forestry are lsquomastingrsquo species, producing good seed crops in certain years with low levels or no seed at all in intervening years.ldquoAs much as two-thirds of that available seed can be lost through predation, weed competition, drought or simply a failure to germinate.ldquoThatrsquos a substantial loss of viable material, so finding ways of meeting any or all of those challenges would greatly improve on the number of saleable tree seedlings that are grown.With it taking up to  years to create a new seed orchard ndash longer for certain species ndash there is mounting need to find a way to maximise the efficiency of current stocks and meet calls for millions of new trees to be planted in order to meet climate change needs.Mr Knox said previous Innovation Challenges have seen ideas flood in often from unexpected sectors and even from lsquogarden shedrsquo inventors.ldquoOur first Challenge was around non-chemical alternatives to controlling a particular pest. We found some people with no experience of forestry sector come forward with fantastic ideas, he added. ldquoIt is entirely possible that someone in a garden shed with a little bit of funding could develop their idea and help us find a solution.Innovators who come up with potentially viable ideas are given funding and support to develop their concept, with a share of up to pound, available to five businesses selected for lsquopre-commercialrsquo contracts.Whoever does hit on a proven solution, however, could also find lucrative markets in other countries that operate a similar style of forestry to the UK, such as Norway, Sweden, France, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.Previous attempts to find a solution to seedling loss have included the use of mycorrhizae fungi to coat some seeds prior to sowing in order to improve germination and subsequent plant growth. The mycorrhizae live in or on the plantsrsquo roots and make phosphate, nitrogen and other nutrients and water available to help boost growth.Soil sterilisation technology has also been used to help tackle weeds, while some early work has been done using existing robotics and seed coating technology which involves covering seeds in a polymer coating. Itrsquos thought that coating the seeds with beneficial properties such as anti-drought or bird repellent could also be explored.One use of robotics in forestry could be in helping to sort out unviable seeds which have been previously identied by imaging technology as dead or infected with parasites, added Mr Knox.However, the scale of Scotlandrsquos forestry industry ndash Forestry and Land Scotland is responsible for growing  million trees a year which are transplanted to national forests ndash means certain technologies, such as fully-automated production lines, would be too costly and dficult to introduce on the large scale required.Mr Knox added: ldquoThere is a lot of robotics and automation in nurseries in Europe that grow stock in little inidual pots. But here we broadcast seed on prepared ground. Any solution has to be suitable for the UK market.Robots are increasingly finding their way into environmental solutions. Tree planting robots have been developed in Canada to plant trees up to  times faster than a human, at around half the cost. Meanwhile, a firm in Oxford has been looking at how to use drones to plant trees in particularly challenging landscapes.Mr Knox added: ldquoAs well as being vital to Scotlandrsquos effort against the climate emergency, improvements in yield would help ensure the security of future timber supply for Scotlandrsquos thriving poundBn forestry industry and its contribution to Scotlandrsquos economy.A lsquobidder dayrsquo event will be held at FLSrsquos tree nursery near Elgin next Monday.

One wonders how high his brother and sister-in-laws eyebrows rose at this line.Its a surprise its taken the prince so long to reach this position given his fathers preoccupation with the environment - but who of us listens to our parents If Harry has been listening he would have heard the Prince of Wales in  make a speech on Islam and the environment, calling for religious views that prevent the use of contraceptives to be considered alongside the \"monumental\" pressures on the planet of overpopulation.He lamented that traditional communities are becoming more consumerist and called on countries to retain local crafts in order to help save the planet, before jetting off to carry out the most overseas trips of any British royal.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Meghan guest edits British Vogue\",\"description\": \"Meghan guest edits British Vogue\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer thumbs mOhdOGKm-.jpg\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests mOhdOGKm.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": :Prince Harry and Meghan Markle launch own official Instagram accountCharles, though, was a little ahead of his time. Questioning our inidual impact on the environment is fashionable now and a part of current public conversation. Earlier this year the American politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez argued that it is a \"legitimate question\" whether or not to have children in the current environment.Harrys views, then, are nothing new. Nor is Meghans decision to guest edit a magazine. The Duchess of Cambridge guest edited the Huffington Post while Prince Harry guest edited Radio Four. If anything should stick in the craw, its that members of a royal family which vocally despises the press quite enjoy trying a hand at journalism themselves. But thats perhaps a niche complaint.As well as mulling over who shall inherit the earth, Harry mulled over with Jane Goodall how we inherit our prejudices with regard to unconscious racist bias. \"Just as stigma is handed down from generation to generation, your perspective on the world and on le and on people is something that is taught to you.\"Harrys views are, though, new to him and his awokening, from Nazi fancy dress costume to nuanced understanding of racial discrimination, is no doubt heavily influenced by his educated, politically aware, feminist we. No bad thing, yet somehow it is.It was to be expected that Prince Harrys we - no matter who she was - would attract public scrutiny. Meghan, a well-established woman with a mind of her own, could never have been expected to twist herself into the shape of the demur, modest royal the public and the right leaning press desire.What Britain asks of its royals is to play a very specic game. To have insight into the struggles of their subjects despite living le at great remove. To be modest despite great riches. To be hard working without any real context for what hard work entails.Meghan was a celebrity, an Instagram influencer and a lestyle blogger and, now a senior royal, she has carried on regardless.Harry and Meghan are far enough removed from the throne that we should be able to say good luck to them. Behave like the Clooneysyou so wish. Even behave like the Kardashiansyou must.We cant say this, however, and there are two sticking points. One, the Kardashian and Clooney money is self-made: the Sussexes are part publicly funded. Two, celebrities promote only themselves the royal family is representing the United Kingdom. We should, it follows, have a say in how we want to be represented.For a pass-remarkable British public which respects the Queen for her apolitical, wide-ranging charitable support, the Sussexes are easy targets for traditionalists. No one likes to be preached to and heres rich Harry chiding people for eating fruit wrapped in plastic, while scooting about on private jets.The British upper lip stfens at the notion of schmaltzy instructions to \"be the change\" and \"live in the deep like a mermaid\". Britain expects access to its royal family in exchange for their luxuries so asking for privacy - keeping the lid of Archies christening, turning Frogmore Cottage into a fortress, forbidding photos at Wimbledon - ruffle feathers.Yet Meghan has been protective of her privacy since day one. Think on her engagement announcement interview: she would not be drawn on the identity of the matchmaker who brought her and her fianceacute together because she wanted to protect them.:Prince Harry and actress Meghan Markle announce engagementIt stands to reason she would be reluctant to put her sons godparents in the spotlight and hypocritical of her to change her stance. Shes basically being lambasted for sticking to her principles and this is part of the problem: so many of the things initially attributed to making Meghan a breath of fresh air have been turned against her.The Sussexes are taking joint decisions as a household yet Meghan is the target of the associated flak. Four of the biggest gun right-wing columnists have used their  this week to try to take her down a peg or two. Her Vogue stewardship has been the source of television debate Eamonn Holmes on This Morning labelled her with the deeply problematic epithet \"uppity\".This flak comes in response to her doing things other royals have done before and singling her out in this way smacks of racism. From some quarters it does more than smack.She has been criticised for wearing too few British designers for how she touched her bump while pregnant for how she has influenced Harry for being rude to Palace staff for feuding with Kate Middleton. All othering, racist, sexist critiques.It is one thing to dislike the Sussexes as a brand and entirely another to claw and claw at Meghan Markle. Youd think we might have learned a lesson about tearing at royal women in this way. Its time to stop."},{"url":null,"title":"dna-reveals-marilyn-monroes-highland-roots","story":"The Some Like It Hot star is up there with Elvis Presley and John Wayne in the pantheon of American popular culture, but it appears Marilyn Monroe has ties a little closer to home.DNA evidence has now proved that the legendary actress has roots in Moray. A descendant of the Munro clan, her ancestral ties can be traced back to the village of Edinkillie, near Forres in Moray.The remote town, which is home to fewer than , people, is a far cry from Los Angeles where Ms Monroe was born in .Star of s classics like Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Seven Year Itch and Some Like it Hot, she died of an overdose at .There has long been speculation over the Hollywood actressrsquos Scottish roots, but her lineage was unconfirmed until now.Next week members of Clan Munro will gather in the Highlands to hear about the latest discoveries in the clanrsquos DNA project detailing Ms Monroersquos relatives.The actress was born Norma Jeane Mortenson but took her now-famous screen name from mother Gladys Monroe. She grew up in LA, home of the movie business.Like many other US Monroes, her fatherrsquos line could be traced back to John Munro, a soldier from the area around Tain, who travelled to America in the mid-th century.He was one of many Scotsmen who fought for the Royalist cause during the English Civil War only to be exiled after its defeat by Oliver Cromwell and is believed to have settled in what is now the US state of Rhode Island.Despite the connection, no Munro men who shared the same signature pattern of the male or Y chromosome had been found in Scotland, so the link to the Highland clan was uncertain. Until now.The Clan Munro DNA project has finally proved Marilynrsquos forefathers were related to a Munro family from Edinkillie.Descendants of this Munro family, some of whom emigrated to the Bahamas in the th century, carry the unique and elusive Y chromosome marker previously found only in descendants of the exiled John Munro.:Herald Archive: When Marilyn Monroe seemed to be at her happiestAnother member of the Moray family, William Munro, emigrated from Scotland to Batavia, now Jakarta in Indonesia, in the early th century.Previously the Munro DNA project found that US President James Monroe was of a dferent male line, most closely related to the Munros of Teaninich Castle in Alness.The discovery comes two years after an appeal for Scots clan members to help confirm the origin of Monroersquos ancestors.The project began after it was discovered that an ancestor of Monroe was a soldier exiled to America after the English Civil War and launched an appeal to find more ancestors.The search was unveiled amid much fanfare to coincide with what would have been Monroersquos th birthday, with Clan Munro USA offering free test kits to Munro men of Highland origin in summer .One year later, the associationrsquos genealogy committee said it was ldquosurprised more Scots had not taken up the offer of the free test kits but that they remained hopeful.Initially, amid deepening suspicious from the Scottish side of the family, the trail ran cold.The one Munro found to be related to Marilyn Monroe failed to respond to any contact from the Americans, suggesting he wanted nothing to do with the project, even after initially volunteering his DNA.Hector Munro, , chief of the Munro clan, acknowledged that there was a vast dference in attitudes between the Americans and their Scottish counterparts when it came to tracing their lineage.:Iconic star Marilyn Monroes ancestors come from small Scottish villageldquoThe Scots think they know their history so they arenrsquot as keen to get involved, he told Theafter the search launched in . ldquoThe further people get away from the Highlands, the more interested they are. Itrsquos about capturing that feeling of belonging.Marilyn Monroe is not the only famous US face whose ancestors are believed to have hailed from Scotland.Author Allan Morrison, from Greenock, claims that the roots of Elvis Presley can be traced back to the village of Lonmay, Aberdeenshire, in the s.His research shows the first Presley in America was an Andrew Presley, who is recorded as living in South Carolina in .The Presley roots in America could be traced right up to , when Elvisrsquos parents married.

Now, the environmental body hopes that this will be reduced by Scotland’s forthcoming depositscheme.Under the scheme, shoppers will pay a p deposit when buying drinks purchased in single-use plastic or glass bottles and aluminium or steel cans. People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling. The aim of that p will be to give people an extra incentive to recycle their empty bottles and cans, and make people think twice about dropping them.#Our new figures reveal how Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme could visibly slash the number of littered plastic bottles in the Orkney Islands,# said Zero Waste Scotland#s chief operating officer, Jill Farrell.#We all hate seeing empty bottles and cans littering our streets, green spaces and beaches. The great thing about Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme is it will give people a p incentive to do the right thing with their empty bottles — take them back for recycling, rather than risk them ending up on our streets or in our rivers.#Litter isn’t just an eyesore — it also pollutes our environment and seas. And for every bottle littered, more plastic has to be created, generating more planet-damaging emissions. When you take back your empty bottles to be recycled, you’ll not just be getting your p back — you’ll be doing your bit in the fight against the climate emergency.#Further figures from Zero Waste Scotland also show that Orkney goes through an estimated . million plastic bottles every year. An estimated , plastic bottles are littered in the county each year. With a p incentive not to throw away your empties, Zero Waste Scotland anticipates a  per cent reduction in litter for the materials included in the scheme. This would mean , fewer plastic bottles dropped in Orkney Islands each year.With plastic bottles only one of the materials included in the scheme, the overall impact on litter is expected to be even higher. Steel and aluminium cans, glass bottles will also be part of the scheme. The Scottish Government is expected to introduce legislation to enable the scheme later this year.

Volunteer cleaners become citizen scientists, as they also record the litter they find along a designated m stretch of every beach that’s cleaned, and it’s this aspect that has helped MCS change policy and behaviours over the last  years.“Now more than ever is the time to turn awareness into action,# says Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland conservation officer. #Everybody is talking about marine litter — you see it on the TV, hear it on the radio and read it in the papers and across social media. We want people to take that awareness and turn it into action by taking part in the biggest beach litter survey and clean up in Scotland! Only by combining awareness with action and data can we make sure that industry and government put in place the urgent measures needed to stop this plastic tide for good.”The p carrier bag charge, a ban on microbeads in wash-off products, consultations on a plastic tax, commitments to depositschemes, a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds in Scotland and the banning of lantern and balloon releases — have all come about following compelling evidence gathered over decades by volunteers at MCS beach cleans. Cleaning and surveying a beach only takes a couple of hours at most. Each beach has a coordinator, who explains how to fill in a simple data form, and then it’s just a case of grabbing a litter picker and a bin bag and filling it up with rubbish.“Beach litter is a serious environmental problem,” says Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer.“But the solution is in our hands. We want the th Great British Beach Clean weekend to be the biggest ever.

Orkney’s MSP highlighted the government’s continued failure to find a solution to the islands’ internal ferry services, including replacement vessels, and the lack of progress on implementing RET on external services, a year on from the promised start date. Mr McArthur said: “The National Islands Plan will be important in mapping out the areas where improvements are needed to secure a vibrant future for our island communities.“During the passage of the legislation, I moved amendments making clear that one of the most urgent priorities would be delivering changes and improvements to leline ferry services to meet the needs of people and businesses in Orkney.“This seems to be the message that is coming through loud and clear in the consultation, as demonstrated by the recent response from the NFUS.  It will come as a surprise to no one but should act as a clear signal to ministers that the continued failure to act is unacceptable.“We need a sustainable and long term solution to the funding and operation of our internal ferry services, on which some of our most fragile communities rely. This includes replacement vessels for a fleet that is ageing and no longer fit for purpose.“In addition, more than a year on from the date on which RET was supposed to be introduced, we seem no nearer seeing the reduction in fares. Those using these services are therefore continuing to pay over the odds. That is not good enough.“Having initiated the consultation, the government now have an obligation to act.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Sadly, many are under threat from coastal erosion and the effects of climate change.“SCHARP is doing brilliant work engaging communities with this issue and working to identy and protect sites across Scotland, including a number here in Orkney.  Without the work of volunteers, however, this would simply not be possible. Those who get involved, devoting their time, energy and local knowledge, are due an enormous debt of gratitude.“For example, volunteers in Sanday helped to move and rebuild eroding structures from the Meur Burnt Mound to the local heritage centre, preserving an important cultural and historical attraction. This is just one example of the invaluable work carried out by volunteers that will allow current and future generations a better understanding of their heritage.“I know there is similar great work being undertaken in communities across Scotland and I’ve written to my MSP colleagues encouraging them to find out more about what is happening in their constituencies and regions. The summer recess provides a perfect opportunity to get out and learn more about these projects and the volunteers that make them possible.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred. Straightforward really!Now, feel free to open the covers and follow the story . . . so far. Experience the ups and downs, intrigue and controversy of more than a century of inter-county football.

Oh, Ruth. As seductive it may seem for the Scottish Tory leader to look towards Canada for solutions to her problems, it just isn’t that simple.The past fortnight could count as the worst in Ruth Davidson’s political career. She has seen the embodiment of everything she’s tried to change in Tory politics take charge of her party and enter Downing Street, triumphant. One of Boris Johnson’s first acts in office was to sack Davidson’s ‘work husband’, David Mundell, who is among her closest political allies and friends. Johnson’s Government is now eagerly marching the country towards a no-deal clf.Hence the latest flurry of suggestions, borrowing from Canada, for a breakaway party in Scotland – the Tory north, strong and free. Murdo Fraser revived his proposal from the  Scottish Tory leadership election, citing the Coalition Avenir Quebec– the governing party of Canada’s second-biggest province, a centre-right pro-business group that embraces key strands of nationalism while rejecting separation. It was formed from the merger of two groups that broke away from the Parti Quebecois, the francophone nationalist party of government since the s.: What Scottish unionists can learn from decline of Quebec’s separatists – Murdo FraserFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereOn John Beattie’s Radio Scotland programme on Monday, the former Scottish Conservative head of communications Andy Maciver also invoked a Canadian solution. In Alberta, the heartland of Canadian conservatism, the Conservative Party of Canada no longer exists at a provincial level. The government in Edmonton is run by the independent United Conservative Party, formed from the merger of what was the Canada-wide Progressive Conservative Party and the local, populist Wildrose Party.Both seemed to suggest that was evidence an independent party could succeed in Scotland. Maybe. But, like Kenny MacAskill in yesterday’s Scotsman, I believe building a separate Conservative brand in Scotland would be easier said than done – for two reasons in particular.First, in a devolved political system, it helps to be in government when you’re dferentiating yourself from the centre. Scottish Labour at Holyrood forged its identity and enacted some of Scotland’s most radical reforms when it did so in defiance of Tony Blair the SNP was confirmed as the natural party of government once it could argue it was standing up for Scotland against Tory London. It’s harder for Davidson to fight that fight from opposition like Wendy Alexander when Labour were out of power in Edinburgh, in Johnson’s first week in office the Scottish Tory leader got squashed.Second, you can only leverage one nationalist or constitutional ide at a time. In Alberta, the right has been fuelled by anger that the province’s oil wealth was being squandered by the federal government. In Quebec, the linguistic, cultural and constitutional ides remain strong even with the question of independence apparently settled. In both provinces, when these political forces have been split between dferent parties, the door opens for their rivals. When they have come together, as under the United Conservative Party and the CAQ, they dominate.But Scotland now has two cleavages, and one of them runs right through the Scottish Conservative Party. Davidson is losing support on one side to the Brexit Party, while pro-EU unionists now have an alternative in a revitalised Liberal Democrats – with a Scottish leader, too.The independence movement is no monolith, and the SNP’s struggles are well-documented, but while support for independence continues to sit at nearly  per cent, Nicola Sturgeon’s party has solid foundations. If there’s anything the Canadian example tells us, it’s that unionism needs a single, dominant force – but we’re not about to see any mergers there.Independence for the Scottish Tories would solve half their troubles, at best.

Nevertheless, there is no harm, but rather a great deal of good, in recognising the horror of the past and addressing its lasting effects. And this is particularly true for historic organisations, like Glasgow University, which yesterday announced a £ million programme of “reparative justice” over  years, that benefited from slavery in the past and still exist today. An agreement with the University of the West Indies will see the creation of the Glasgow-Caribbean Centre for Development Research.There is a theory that racism developed as a means to excuse the brutality of the transatlantic slave trade. It is by working together, in academic ways or otherwise, that such a hateful way of thinking can finally be thrown off.

He said negativity among the British public in the run-up to the event was replaced by optimism after film director Danny Boyle’s opening ceremony showcased the country at its best.He told Motor Sport magazine: “There were so many doubters leading into the Games saying the transport was going to be terrible, the weather is going to be awful, we’re not going to win any medals and it’s going to be a disaster.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re.

The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port. A breakwater will allow us to provide overnight berths and efficient, comfortable transfer for cruise ship passengers, while a visitor centre will provide a warm highland welcome to visitors from across the globe. This project will be transformational for Portree and surrounding areas.#The community trusts of Skye and Lochalsh all have several features in common. They have vision, ambition, energy and drive and they are full of volunteers who are committed to bringing long-term projects to fruition for the benefit of their community # and their visitors # for decades to come."},{"url":null,"title":"chance to visit eden project","story":"Community minded people in Mid  East Antrim who want to make good happen where they live are invited to apply for a special weekend at the famous Eden Project in Cornwall.There they will have the opportunity to share inspiration and bring home ideas to implement in their neighbourhood.Thanks to people who play the National Lottery, successful applicants will have accommodation and transport along with the weekend community camp costs all paid for.

The play shows a time in history of the bitterness of some people captured through Marie’s writing during that football match. I know there is a percentage on both sides of people who still hold a bit of resentment but hopefully the majority of us have moved on and this piece shows what can happen when we do move on.“This is the first time I’ve done something like this, something on this scale, and it’s the same show, basically on people’s doorstep at the Devenish. We finished a fantastic run at the Lyric Theatre, the Féile is also part of our tour before we head to Derry. The Irish Arts Centre in New York came to see it in the Lyric and there is talk of taking it over to the States for the Irish Arts Festival in February.”Gerard continued: “If people with tickets for the s Night which is happening as part of Féile want to come to the show first, then we wanted to put it out in the Andersonstown News that they can get a ticket half pricethey show their ticket at the door or contact us via sodabreadtheatre@gmail – we can give them a code when booking.“We are really looking forward to bringing the piece to the Devenish and hearing people’s reaction to the work.”A Night in November will be performed at the Devenish Complex on Sunday, August .

They are intent on pursuing a strategy to undermine workers’ pay, terms and conditions as well as imposing price hikes excluding lower income users. There is now a substantial two-tier workforce with increasing numbers of casual workers coming in on poverty pay rates while those previously employed by Belfast City Council are being denied pay uplts, leaving their wages fall ever closer to the legal minimum.“The community has been left behind as well. Last year Unite called a protest against the price hikes and attacks on workers’ pay and conditions on the peaceline which drew signicant cross-community support from both the Shankill and Falls. Working class people are united in their opposition to the council’s austerity-driven policies on leisure services.“Belfast City Council voted to outsource leisure services to this company – they cannot wash their hands of the consequences of that for either the public or their former employees. We call on all parties to reconsider their positions and bring these public services back in-house and give all the GLL workers a decent pay uplt.”A spokesperson for GLL said the company would meet union representatives to “understand the issues they have”.“GLL remains committed to genuine engagement on these matters in the interests of all parties, and to ensure the seamless provision of services across all of our leisure centres,” the spokesperson added.A Belfast City Council spokesperson said: “Belfast City Council is disappointed to learn that strike action is being considered at the city’s leisure centres. Council is committed to working with GLL, its employees and their representatives to ensure the continued provision of leisure services to all our ratepayers across Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"casement park decision due by the end of year","story":"THE long awaited planning decision for the redevelopment of Casement Park is anticipated to be made before the end of this year.

Mr Maskey said he would be “very disappointed”the planning decision was not made within the next five months. “In all likelihood, in the absence of a minister, it will be DfI’s Permanent Secretary Katrina Godfrey making the decision.”When asked what would he say to those in the community who think Casement will never be built Mr Maskey said: “We are pushing for Casement to get built – I can understand that people say this will never be done because its been frustrating for so long, it has taken all these years to get the project to this stage. “I think the negavity around the project has reduced over the years. The new design has come in, there has been a lot of hard work done behind the scenes to try and get this major investment for West Belfast through. “The GAA have assured us that all the information needed is all in, that there are no outstanding issues at this stage. “There should be nothing that stalls this project back any further.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"family of joe burns raise over 3000 in","story":"THE family of a popular barman at The Chester have surpassed the £, mark in their fundraising efforts to keep his memory alive.Joe Burns died suddenly five years ago in July , aged just  after collapsing at his parent’s home.Joe was a fit and healthy boxer who trained regularly at the gym.Tragically, the day after his death, his girlfriend Sinead discovered she was pregnant with their daughter Bella who is now four-years-old.Soon after Joe’s death, his family learned Joe’s mum Una and sister Jeanette both carry the faulty gene for Long QT, an inherited condition that can cause heart rhythm disturbances. Left undiagnosed, it can cause sudden death where someone has an unexpected cardiac arrest.Every year since, Joe’s family and friends take part in the annual Belfast Marathon, with all proceeds going towards the British Heart Foundation who use the money to fund research into silent heart conditions.This year,  members of Joe’s family and friends raised £, from their Marathon efforts.

Each year we just keep getting bigger and better with more people from our community getting involved through the full marathon, fun run and relay.“When Joe died our family was absolutely devastated. He was a real character and everyone knew him. He made such a big impact on so many people and it’s amazing that so many of his friends are still so supportive and want to help our fundraising efforts.“We don’t want what happened to our family to happen to any other family so that’s why we fundraise for the BHF because their research into conditions like Long QT are making such a big dference.”Jeanette said they have been overwhelmed by the support from their local community since Joe’s death.“Friends and family have just been fantastic.

Those included Foyle Jobs and Benefits Office on Asylum Road, Carlisle House on Carlisle Road and Orchard House on Foyle Street from early morning until .am.After the picket lines, members gathered for a rally at the City Hotel which began at .am.The -hour strike was organised to highlight an imposed “pay deal” of .% and changes to terms and conditions of employment which union officials claim have been implemented without proper and meaningful consultation.Ms Gates addressed the rally along with Gerry Murphy, President of Irish Congress of Trade Unionsand Niall McCarroll, Chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council .Mr McCarroll addressed a packed room at the City Hotel where he said all workers had taken action to bring about better working conditions.He said the Tory government was “attacking working class communities” and it is time to “fight back” by building solidarity amongst workers. “Let us together build up a working-class spirit and let the Tories know we can bring them down.”Meanwhile, Ms Gates was keen to dispel the notion of civil servants having well-paid “cushy jobs” as an “absolute myth”. She added: “There are civil servants relying on tax credits, second jobs, credit cards to bring them to the end of the month or to pay off debts and those using food banks.”She praised those in the room for leading the way, recognising that many,not all of them, could ill afford to go without pay for the day. “We have to say, enough is enough, they can’t keep piling work on us and saying they can’t even give us a decent pay increase.“Many workers are % worse off than ten years ago in real terms.”Referring to legal action which has been initiated for “failure to consult”, she informed those in attendance, that the judge has decided to forego a pre-hearing by instead fixing a court date.She added that there will be a “few white faces” in the Department of Finance who know their actions have been “discriminatory” as they have been “acting outside the law”. And concluded by saying “it’s time to strike a blow for all workers”.Other members of the audience were afforded an opportunity to speak and one worker, named Amy, said the government does not care about workers standards of living, nor their mental and physical health. She demanded a living wage for all.A motion was put forward by People Before Profit at last month’s full Council meeting calling on the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Finance to provide a “fair and just settlement” which was backed by all councillors.

It is perched above the Co Donegal village of Burt and attracts thousands of visitors every year.The fort is a powerful manestation of what remains of ancient Ireland and on a clear day, from its pinnacle, it is possible to get a glimpse of three counties-Donegal, Derry and Tyrone. The commanding and spectacular waterways of Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle lie to its west and east respectively.But, in the th Century the fort, once home to kings of old Gaelic order, was rapidly disintegrating towards extinction. It was however saved by the vision of one man who spearheaded its restoration just over  years ago.Dr Walter Bernard was born on May ,  at Newmarket, Co Cork. His father was a captain in the th Rles, a regiment of the British Army and was amongst the reinforcements that arrived in Brussels on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo in June of  but was apparently too late to take part in the famed history changing conflict.Walter became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland in , a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in  and Fellow of that college in .Between - Dr Bernard served as a surgeon throughout the Crimean War attending the wounded British soldiers at Inkerman and witnessed the ravages caused by small pox and cholera. He later recalled that for every man that was shot, fty more were killed by those diseases, particularly in the notoriously harsh winters of  and .On the journey home from the Ukranian battlefields, he saved a man from drowning and was awarded with a certicate from the Royal Humane Society. Then, with his experiences of military conflict at an end, Dr Bernard landed back in Ireland and settled in Buncrana before building up a very large medical practice in Derry. He ran this surgery for over sixty years and was a prominent member of the city’s branch of the British Medical Association as well as holding many public offices throughout his career.One such appointment was to examine the quality of water in the city for Londonderry Corporation at public facilities such as the Creggan reservoirs built in stages between -, and which supplied much of the city’s domestic and industrial water needs.His experience of the waterborne disease cholera in the Crimea made him an ideal candidate for this job.Dr Bernard also addressed the Medical Society of King and Queens College of Physicians on the issuer of diphtheria in April . He cautioned the assembled medics that there was a reason why the disease was largely absent from statistics sheets.He said: “There are few diseases about which so many mistakes in diagnosis are made.”He feared the misdiagnosis rate was so high that it was almost impossible to ensure that ‘true diphtheria’ was as common in a town as reported.Dr Bernard added: “Diphtheria occurs in Londonderry, I have no doubt whatever…in my practice it has been my lot to treat many cases of this disease.”At some point in , Dr Bernard paid a visit to Grianan of Aileach and many years later in , he said of the experience: “Seventeen years ago, when this traditional and historical place was first visited by me, I found it in a very ruinous condition, and from that time I commenced to take an interest in its associations.“Year after year I witnessed further advance of its ruin, and I clearly saw thatsomething were not soon done to arrest the progress of its destruction, it would be in a few years a thing of the past.”Grianan of Aileach is a hilltop fort that sits on top of Greenan Mountain in Inishowen just over  feet above ground level.The ringfort was thought to have been built in the sixth or seventh century, although there is some evidence to suggest that the site had been in use before that.Greek astronomer and cartographer Ptolemy penned a remarkably accurate map of Ireland in  A.D. from which maps were later created in the th and th centuries. He called the land ‘Iouernia’, thought to mean ‘abundant land’ from which the Irish names Eriu and Eire are derived. Amongst two sites identied as ‘regia’ or royal places in Ireland by the Greek map maker, one of them is believed by some historians to be the Grianan of Aileach.Whether Ptolemy pinpointed it or not, the Kingdom of Aileach was indeed one of Ireland’s royal sites of the Gaelic order. The fort was thought to have been constructed originally by the northern section of the Ui Neill clan, but between  A.D. and the thirteen centuries, over  kings from ious clans, some also High Kings of Ireland, held the throne of Aileach. The last man to be known as the King of Aileach was Aed Buide Ua Neill who died in .Despite ious interpretations, it is generally agreed that Aileach means ‘stony place’ and the word Grianan means ‘sunny place’ so that Grianan of Aileach broadly translates as ‘The Stone Palace of the Sunny View’.Whatever the actual meaning of its name, it is evident that it was an extremely important place. Aileach’s political and strategic importance was such that the annals of Irish history record that it was attacked at least three times. In , Finsnechta Fledach, King of Ireland, destroyed the fort.Again, in , when Muirchertach MacNeill was king, Viking raiders sacked the site when they settled at Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. It’s also thought that King Brian Boru came to Aileach in , but it was destroyed once more in , when another King of Munster, Muirchertach Ua Briaincame to Inishowen and plundered the region and razed the fort. The fort was laid to waste by O’Brien in revenge for O’Neill’s destruction of his royal seat at Kincora and he reportedly told his soldiers to each take a stone from the Donegal hillside so the place would be reduced to rubble.The fort itself could have served two main s both as a defensive and a ceremonial one and moreover as a settlement that was surrounded by ringforts of lesser importance. Whatever its actual , it is known that buildings of this nature were very rare in North West Ulster and its presence signies that its inhabitants were regarded as being very important.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe linking of St Patrick to the site is seen as attempt by Christian converts to place it firmly in that tradition whilst acknowledging its pagan history and the naming of a holy well right outside the ringfort in honour of Ireland’s patron saint seems to confirm that.There is also a mythological and folklore version of the founding of Grianan of Aileach which says the ringfort was built by Dagda , a god and the king of the Tuatha De Danann-the supposed ‘Tribe of the Gods’-a supernatural race in Irish mythology. The Tuatha De Danann are said to have invaded Ireland before the Celts and built strategic stone forts on the tops of hills.Dagda was said to have fought the Second Battle of Moytirra against the Fomorians and the fort at Aileach was built over the grave of his son Aedh who had been murdered.In , a Derry based group called the Irish Irelanders, enthusiastic Gaelic revivalists travelled to the site on Sunday afternoons and carried out some repairs. But, the splendour and historical intrigue of Grianan of Aileach had largely been ignored for many years until in , Dr Walter Bernard decided to begin its restoration in earnest.In the s, painter, musician, antiquarian and archaeologist George Petrie examined Grianan of Aileach when he was head of the Royal Irish Academy’s antiquities committee which was linked to the Irish Ordnance Survey.Petrie’s findings suggested that the hill many have been enclosed by many other ramparts and a line of stones leading up to the entrance which were all gone by then.But, despite his efforts, the expert’s findings remained confined to the records of the Royal Irish Academy, there were no efforts by the organisation to attempt any restoration of the ancient site.It was Dr Bernard who took practical action beyond the analysis of the site. He paid for the entire project that took place between - and recruited his crew of labourers from the farms surrounding Burt. They ferried the materials needed for the restoration on the back up small carts up supplied by the local landowners up the incredibly steep hill.What the doctor found at the site was a disorganised mess of which he said it was: “An immense circular heap of stones, with its grey fallen masonry scattered over the interior-no vestige of a wall, entrance passage, or central building.”Remembering that Walter Bernard was a medical doctor with no detailed description of what an ancient ringfort truly looked like and that there weren’t enough stones on site to complete the job, makes this story even more remarkable.Dr Bernard discovered many animal bones on the site including sheep, cows and goats and items like sling stones and warrior’s clubs. The most interesting stone object discovered was a ‘slab of sandstone, chequered into thirty-six squares’, believed to be a games board of some type.The doctor and his crew of labourers used the measurements of other Irish forts such as Staigue Fort in Co Kerry as the comparative basis for the restoration project at Grianan of Aileach. The finished product is a fort that stands . metres in diameter and more than five metres tall with walls that are almost four metres thick.Dr Bernard later described a part of the building project by saying: “To bind our work into a complete unity we had to gather around the hill about  or  loose stones-certainly not more,so many-and to split from the adjoining rocks, cropping up through the heather,  coping stones. These are supposed to serve instead of those removed by King Murdock O’Brien in .”Only speculation can be used to assessthe interior of today’s fort accurately resembles its ancient predecessor, but when the alternative was the complete disappearance of the Iron Age construction, then surely Bernard’s efforts become even more admirable.The fort has stood for centuries as a silent witness to major events of Irish history. From the top of Grianan fort you can just make out the location of the Co Donegal village of Rathmullen on the western bank of Lough Swilly.It was from Rathmullen in  that the chieftains Hugh O’Neill and Rory O’Donnell sailed with their families after the final defeat by the English taking with them the last symbols of the old Gaelic order once enshrined in its pomp by places such as Grianan of Aileach. Behind them in the distance the old fort sat on its hilltop as a fading reminder of a society and its traditions that would never .A legend says that in a secret cave on a hill beneath Grianan O’Neill’s warriors rest in a bewitched sleep in full armour and sitting on their horses ready for the next fight. The spell, says the legend, will only be broken when the next destined leader of Ulster arrives to lead them to victory.It is a myth that would have no visible attachmentit had not been for the passion of Dr Walter Bernard in the late th century in restoring Grianan of Aileach to something approaching its former glory.A tourist road to the fort was opened on September ,  by President of Ireland Eamon De Valera who was accompanied by Fine Gael TD for Donegal West, Pat O’Donnell, then Minister for Local Government. In the early s the Office of Public Works in the Republic of Ireland carried out further repairs to Grianan of Aileacgh after a wall collapsed. But as late as October  the Irish Government was being severely criticised by political representatives in Donegal for still failing to establish tour guides and other facilities at the ancient site.In his obituary contained in the Universities and Colleges magazine of December , , it was reported that Dr Bernard died suddenly at his residence in Buncrana on eight days previously on December . He was -years-old and was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Dr Bernard’s obituary ended: “He leaves a widow. His le was deeply scarred by three great sorrows, the deaths of his three children.”CAPTION: The volunteers involved in the restoration of Grianan of Aileach pictured at its official re-opening in ."},{"url":null,"title":"derry university group ready support development north west institution","story":"The Derry University Group has said it is willing to “advise and support” the local council in establishing an independent university in the city.A meeting was held between Council Chief Executive John Kelpie, Deputy Mayor Cara Hunter, and the new Secretary of State for NI this week where the ongoing campaign for a Medical school at Magee was discussed.The Derry University Groupfelt it was a prime opportunity to impress upon SoS Julian Smith the need for an independent university in the city.This month, Derry City  Strabane District Councillors unanimously backed a motion supporting the exploration of all options for university provision in the North West. That included the expansion of Magee and the possibility of an independent university put forward by the DUG.The move followed an intervention by Labour Peer Lord Adonis who convinced the House of Lords to publish a report on the improvement of higher education provision in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a university whose principal campus is in Derry.A spokesperson for the Derry University Group said it is clear that the momentum for a dedicated university for the North West is growing all the time.“In recent months, Derry Strabane Council and other major influencers in Westminster and Dublin have committed themselves to delivering an independent university for the North West.“There has also been huge support from US colleges, who want to partner with a standalone university in Derry. It is completely apparent that the public here want action from the governments on a new university, now, as a matter of urgent priority.”“The North West, despite the political uncertainty, is in a prime position to establish a new cultural and educational institution, which could act as a catalyst for the economic regeneration of the region and reverse the damage already being done by Brexit on the Derry and Donegal communities.“The Derry University Group is willing to advise and assist Council and others in developing and delivering a new university, as we have always done in the past. Of course we also need a Medical School for the North West as part of any new university, but it is only a very small part of a much bigger picture.“We need a minimum of , additional students in this city.

This impact was particularly felt in areas like here in Strabane where pride in the hunger strikers, their courage and sacrice still remains undiminished almost  years on.”The roots of what took place in  began several years earlier, when in  Belfast republican Kieran Nugent became the first man to refuse to wear a prison unorm. In , republicans had been accorded what the British termed Special Category Status recognising the political nature of their offences.By the mid-s however, political status had been withdrawn and as the cages of Long Kesh were replaced by the concrete H Blocks, the new British policy of ‘normalisation’ was wholly designed to strike any notion of political credence away from the IRA campaign.When he entered the H Blocks, Kieran Nugent was instructed to put a prison unorm on by the authorities. He answered, ‘you’ll have to nail it to my back.’ This began five years of protest inside the prison and heightened violence outside it which resulted in dozens of deaths.The blanket and no wash protests of the first four years of the prison conflict yielded no concessions on the issue of political status.The years of isolation and living in dire conditions eventually brought the situation to a head. The choice was plain and stark. The protesting republican prisoners could either concede and serve out jail sentences classed as ‘ordinary criminals’ or escalate the protest to the last ‘weapon’ available to them inside a prison-the hunger strike.It was not a new tactic for the republican movement, and it drew its inspiration from stories from the old Gaelic order.It’s recorded in the annals of Irish history that when a citizen felt slighted by the ruling order, it was not uncommon for them to lie outside their dwelling and refuse food in the hope of publicly shaming the guilty party into reparation and or an apology.In , Thomas Ashe died in Mountjoy prison in Dublin after being force fed whilst on hunger strike demanding political status. Then, in , the Lord Mayor of Cork Terence McSwiney died after  days whilst on hunger strike in Brixton jail. And, next year in  to mark the centenary of the death of McSwiney, the National Hunger Strike Commemoration will take place in Cork city.Back in , Michael Gaughan died in Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight after  days on hunger strike, and shortly before the beginning of the prison blanket and no wash protests in Long Kesh, in February , another Mayo man, Frank Stagg died at Wakefield jail in Yorkshire after  days without food.The first Long Kesh hunger strike began on October , . The protestors set out a list of five demands: -The right not to wear a prison unorm -The right not to do prison work -The right of free association with other prisoners -The right to organise their own educational and recreational facilities and -The right to one visit, one letter and one parcel a week.Seven men, including Sinn Fein MLA Raymond McCartney said they would fast to the death in the pursuit of the re-establishment of political status. Simultaneously, three female republican prisoners also embarked on a strike in Armagh jail.As Christmas  approached, the British offered a deal which appeared to agree to the central demand of the right not to wear a prison unorm. One of the hunger strikers, Sean McKenna was close to death at this stage and the strike was called off. It later emerged that was really being offered was a deal to allow prisoners to wear ‘civilian type clothing’ supplied by the prison regime. The scene was therefore already set for a second strike.It began on March ,  when Bobby Sands refused to eat. Raymond McCartney said: “Obviously everybody’s memory of  is the fact that ten people died on hunger strike.“On March ,  the British Government removed political status. I think most people thought that this was a half-hearted attempt and they’d roll over within a short period of time.“But, clearly what was emerging was a complete change in policy by the British Government who were intent on the idea of ‘normalisation’, ‘criminalisation’ and ‘Ulsterisation’.“Instinctively, any of us who found ourselves in prison at that time, knew we were political prisoners and any attempt to criminalise us just wasn’t going to work. It became a battle of wills.“But, I think by the end of the hunger strike in October, , most people looking on were saying that whatever was going on in the North that nobody in their wildest notion thought it was a criminal conspiracy. They certainly saw it as a political conflict. They may not have agreed with the armed actions of the IRA, but they certainly viewed it as a political situation.“So, for us by that stage, the process of criminalisation was in tatters. But, there was a very high price paid because  people had died in prison and  or  people had died on the streets.“Within the prisons we knew that we still had work to do because what we had to do was turn that acceptance of political imprisonment into every day conditions. By the end of the hunger strike I suppose there was a big recognition of the dference between the criminal’s unorm and our own clothes was one manestation of it. And, over the years we continued to ensure the conditions in Long Kesh reflected that.“By the late s and early s, journalists were frequent visitors to the prison and left with the overwhelming impression that we were a ‘dferent type’ of prisoner. They may have gone out and had questions about who you were and what you were about but they were in doubt that we were political prisoners. That was a big source of validation.”The intensity of the events and scale of death and destruction between  and  in retrospect now seems enormous, but Raymond McCartney maintains that it paved the way for future political developments.“It was only five years, but it was a very intense five years. It is only when you get a bit older you realise just how short a time span it was, because when you roll onto  and the Good Friday Agreement there was an acceptance of the framework that there was a political conflict which had to be resolved by political means-the recognition of political mandates, the political framework to address all these issues, but at the core of that was the acceptance of political prisoners.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“There is no doubt there is evidence that there were elements within the British Government were determined that political status should not be granted for whatever reason.“Even in , when there was internment without trial and up to , people were held in conditions where they wore their own clothes. There was a recognition of the political conflict of one nature or another.“How that was defined by dferent people is a dferent matter. I know that other people have made the observation that for too long the British tried to deal with the North as a security issue. therefore, when you have a security mentality or emergency laws, emergency courts, emergency interrogation centres, everything is changed and turned upside down.“If you follow their logic from that point of view and they say ‘you cannot now say you are political prisoners’ whilst trying to pretend that everything  about the situation isn’t political too then the penny drops in a whole lot of ways.”The almost  years since  have provoked much debate within wider nationalism about whether or not the hunger strike was harnessed as a catalyst for the republican movement to embark on the path to politics.The election of Bobby Sands to Westminster and Kieran Doherty to the Dail was followed quickly by a debate within Sinn Fein about ending their policy of abstentionism from political institutions that would lead to a split in the republican movement in . The Derry News asked Raymond McCartney for his view on this.He said: “It is interesting now, because everyone has their story about what the origins of the peace process was. But, there is absolutely no doubt that when you look back as far as  that Gerry Adams that there needed to be a political way of resolving the conflict, because military stalemate was exactly that.“The famous Glover Report from the British Army accepted that there was not going to be a military defeat, was them in their own way, saying the IRA was a political force and that the guys in Long Kesh were political prisoners. They job they were sent to do, they couldn’t do and that was to impose a military defeat and by extension their laws of oppression were not going to work either.“It made the situation painful and made the conflict last longer. Then, whenever the formula for the Good Friday Agreement was put forward, some former prisoners will tell you that it was too high a price to pay, but the core accepted it was a political problem and without political solutions it was never going to be resolved.”When the first hunger strike ended in October of , Raymond McCartney had gone without food for  days. So, what are his own personal recollections of the physical effects of what took place “I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.“In a very strange way hunger strike affects dferent people in dferent ways. Even the day the hunger strike ended in , I was still walking about, I was out of bed. But, there is no doubt that your body slows down.“My ability to see was greatly affected. But, the body is a remarkable piece of equipment and resilience is obviously built in. As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.“I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.

However, Raymond McCartney believes that her thinking was a lot wider than that.“Whatever her antipathy towards Ireland was and what came with that, she was setting out a broader political stall. Look at how she treated the miner’s later on.“Reading state papers now, years after these events, her take on the miner’s strike wasn’t just a battle about conditions in the mines, it was about strategically tackling trade unions. It was a case of her saying who is the strongest union-who is the spine of the working class and acting on that.“I always remember that being in jail gives you the time to reflect and read and think and I also always remember that Bobby Sands out of all the people who had been in jail was very clear about what he was there for because he wrote it all down. Some of the things he wrote captures the way a writer works-it’s all encompassing and puts it out there in a very vivid way.“I had previously been interned, I had an understanding about what being a political prisoner was. You had your own clothes and a bit of freedom to associate with other prisoners and you didn’t feel that sense of captivity although you were locked up. Bobby Sands caught on very early that the British were trying to defeat us in the prisons. It wasn’t just about trying to give you a hard time or denying you your own clothes, it was that they had a core idea to break us.“One of the rewarding things for me personally was that the system we had in the end in jail was one based on equality. That we treated people as equals. If you couldn’t treat the person beside you as a comrade and an equal that you couldn’t expect anyone  to believe that you’d treat all people as equals as you went on through le.”Those wishing to attend the th National Hunger Strike Commemoration are asked to assemble on Sunday, August  at .pm at the Diamond in Lford before marching across the border into Strabane where Martina Anderson MEP will deliver this year’s main oration.CAPTION: Raymond McCartney spent  days on hunger strike in ."},{"url":null,"title":"studio2 summer dance","story":"Greater Shantallow Community Arts are seeking participants for their annual Summer Dance Camp.If you are between --years-old this is a fantastic opportunity to take part in an two-week long exciting event.

No details were provided on how existing vegetation will be retained and no bioersity checklist was provided.”The residents also employed planning consultant Lee Kennedy, who told the Council of his concerns that some demolition work to existing buildings on the proposed development site had already taken place, prior to planning approval and that trees had been felled along the rear boundary of the site close to the homes of the objectors.A spokesperson for the Waterfoot residents said: “Mr Kennedy went onto state that residents have expressed genuine fears about a threat to the remaining vegetation on the application site.“He reminded Council that they hold a duty of care to work in the public interest and offer protection to the remaining mature trees, by the serving of a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderunder the  Planning Act.”Mr Kennedy confirmed to the Derry News that he had submitted a request for a TPO from the Council, but “no action had been taken.”However, the Waterfoot Park residents say their fears were heightened again earlier this month when a team of workers appeared on the proposed development site and began to cut down more trees.A spokesperson for the residents told the Derry News: “On Friday, July  at .am the neighbours were woken with the sound of several power saws and saw a full team of tree cutters on site behind them.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Within an hour they had created absolute mayhem on the site, with trees felled all around and they were left when they fell. The ground and houses nearby vibrated and caused house alarms to go off.“Some neighbours felt very intimidated, shocked and panicked with the suddenness, noise level and by the time of the morning it happened. The residents are up in arms. It should never have been allowed to happen as Council was made aware last year about their responsibility of a duty of care to work in the public interest. The residents feel unsupported to date in their endeavours to the Council.”Addressing the residents’ concerns, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said that: “During the processing of the application,  objections have been received to the proposed development.“Correspondence to the Planning Department from Planning Consultant, Mr Lee Kennedy acting on behalf of the objectors, was received on August ,  and raised concerns regarding the trees on the site, and a request for a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderto be served on the site.“These concerns were raised with the Planning Department’s Tree Preservation Officer on September ,  who advised on September , that in his professional opinion, a TPO was not appropriate for this site given the nature, type and scale of trees.”On April  this year, Planning Department officials met with objectors at the city’s Council offices, where again, the Tree Preservation Officer advised that a TPO was considered but was unnecessary when assessed against the criteria required for a TPO.The Council spokesperson continued: “The site was further inspected by planning officers on June ,  and officers met with objectors on site.“More recently, the case officer wrote to the agent and the applicant on June ,  to advise that further information was required. Amongst other things requested, the case officer advised that a tree survey of the site was required, a landscaping plan to show existing trees and vegetation to be retained and additional planting to be shown and a bioersity checklist was to be submitted to advise on any existing ecology on the site.“The agent confirmed in correspondence dated, July  that a Phase  habitat survey was instructed to be carried out as well as a tree survey and would be submitted in due course.”However, the Council spokesperson added: “The Planning Department were made aware by an objector by email on July ,  that eight trees along the boundary of the site adjacent to properties in Waterfoot Park had been felled on July  at .am.“Council takes its obligations in respect of these matters seriously and has undertaken an appropriate course of action to ensure that the opinions of residents are and will be fully considered in the processing of the planning application.”CAPTION: Residents of Waterfoot Park have accused the Council of failing to provide a duty of care in relation to a proposed building development."},{"url":null,"title":"powys new head education appointed","story":"Dr Caroline Turner the new chief executive of Powys County Council, takes the heltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtlm on February .lt spangtlt spangt\" POWYS: Has new head of education been appointed Head of education, Dr Alec Clark\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"removing complication","story":"Be more active and to stick to your calorie deficit.\" Removing the Complication of it all, says Mark Davies of Zenith FitBe more active and to stick to your calorie deficit.\" Removing the Complication of it all, says Mark Davies of Zenith FitGet your training off to a great start with this special offer.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"burglary llanidloes see hear anything","story":"Library image of police tape\" Burglary in Llanidloes – did you see or hear anything Library image of police tape\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"re off race life llanfair caereinion   picture special","story":"Caereinion High School pupils and staff took part in the Race For Le -

If we all do a little bit, wersquoll ensure the service is maintained for today, tomorrow and future generations.Earlier this year, local politicians agreed to take the lead in securing financial support for the air ambulance service and also make a monetary contribution to help meet the servicersquos poundm annual running costs.The Department of Health allocates around poundm in annual funding to help keep the helicopter service in the air with money used to finance the air ambulance crew, medicines and medical equipment. Charity funds, including public donations, sustains the aviation side of the operation.It was announced recently that as part of the ongoing consultation on reshaping stroke services, the Department has made a commitment to extend the partnership with Air Ambulance Northern Irelandto enable the helicopter emergency medical service to provide a secondary response to incidents, including strokes, by .Health officials have also confirmed that any changes to the existing arrangement would be subject to the completion of an appropriate business case and agreement with the air ambulance with regard to any funding implications..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charity Beer and Bubbles 5k run in Finnebrogue  ","story":"M B McGRADY  Co Chartered Accountants is setting the pace this September with the launch of the Beer and Bubbles k run in a bid to raise money for Air Ambulance NI.Open to competitors of all ages and experiences, the race will take place on Thursday, September , at Finnebrogue Woods, nestled on the outskirts of Downpatrick.This is the first k race to take place at the idyllic venue, with the route mapped out so runners take in the stunning woodland and finish close to the lakeside, where they will be able to soak up the atmosphere while enjoying a glass of local beer or prosecco.The event follows on from last yearrsquos successful M B Grady  Co Ultimate Aqua Challenge,.Conaill McGrady, director of M B McGrady  Co, said: ldquoWe are delighted to be supporting Air Ambulance NI for a second year and helping to contribute to maintaining the vital work that they do.

They opened the scoring through Gareth George and he added a free to give the visitors an early cushion.Indeed, Bright had plenty more chances to add to this score, but were wasteful in their shot selection. The Holywood men finally woke up and a tidy score from Connor McAnespie after  minutes opened their account.Bright again replied with a fine score from Marc Burke before Martin Cox opened his account for Holywood with a point after  minutes. Barry Kilkey levelled the contest three minutes later from close range and Freddie OrsquoConnor scored for Bright to edge them ahead again.Foolish tackling and unnecessary frees were costing St Paulrsquos in the game and helped Bright dominate the play In the first half.The gamersquos opening goal, however, swung the play towards the Holywood men again. Fantastic work from Seaacuten Tucker around the middle of the park and his long ball into the danger area found Marty Cox in space.Cox caught the ball in mid-air, landed and turned in one motion before smashing the ball past Michael Ferrand, who had no chance. The sizable crowd roared with delight and momentum was now with St Paulrsquos as Tucker added another score from play.Once again, however, ill discipline and poor tackling would cost St Paulrsquos. Paddy Falls high tackle left George with a handy free to cut the deficit before Tucker added a free from m out on the left.George added the final score of the half for Bright leaving St Paulrsquos two points clear at the half-time whistle - to -.Bright again took the early initiative at the start of the second half and a point by Rian Tempany set the early tone. A big talking point came at six minutes into the second half when referee John McMullan sent off two players, one from each team after an altercation at a break downThe next few scores were to and fro with Tucker scoring three points and George replying in kind, aided by Tempany. The game was tied at - to - drawing at  when St Paulrsquosadded their second goal in the th minute.Fine work from Daniel Eastwood and Cox set up Tucker who danced around two Bright defenders before slotting the ball home from  metres. The home crowd were again in raptures, expecting St Paulrsquos to see the game out.However, game management has been a big problem this season for the Holywood men, given the average age of the team is  it is perhaps understandable that experience to see games out is just not there yet.St Paulrsquos tried to slow the game down, but with about  minutes still to be played, it was far too early for that. Bright caught St Paulrsquos in possession on numerous occasionsand turned the ball over for score after score.George was a constant threat and punished each mistake by the Holywood men with a score.

He did, however, admit that the itinerary has been sent to Rome.Venues for the Popersquos visit are pure speculation and certainly newspapers are free to speculate, he added.It is understood that Downpatrick was one of the three venues north of the border suggested by the committee of  bishops, headed by Cardinal OrsquoFiaich, when they met last week.The decision on whether the Pope will include Northern Ireland in his tour will be taken in Rome, but it is believed that alternative venues in the Republic have been suggestedthe Pope decides not to cross the border.The choice of Downpatrick mdash with its strong historical links with Christianity and St Patrick mdash is understood to have been a move to give the Pope the opportunity to see as many people as possible.It is also thought that Armagh mdash the ecclesiastical headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland mdash and Londonderry were studied as possible venues for a visit.Until the programme is finalised, the only places certain to be included in the itinerary are Dublin and the Marian Shrine at Knock, County Mayo.Dr Joseph Maguire, Parish Priest of Downpatrick, said that he personally had not been contacted about any visit from Pope John Paul II, but he admitted that Downpatrick would have been one of the first places to think of.ldquoWe would be delighted to be so honoured with a visit from the Holy Father and he would be most welcome he said.KILLYLEAGH mdash A one-day token strike by production workers closed the Killyleagh Mill yesterday.Around  workers walked out, seeking a wages increase.

Two special zones will be developed for car parking on either side of the beach and a park for upwards of  cars will be provided in the centre, off the beach area.Under no circumstances, however, will cars be allowed to drive up and down the beach area and the council is expected to appoint full-time beach inspectors to supervise parking during the summer season.The private entrances presently used by beach-goers will be blocked off and two new public driveways will be constructed.

The garden has been created by staff and contractors from housebuilders Barratt Homes and David Wilson Homes.The custom design incorporates traditional elements of earth, wind, fire and air, and has been purpose-built for the school.Ysgol Y Deri supports a erse range of pupils with specialist needs from ages three to .Rhys Jones said: ldquoItrsquos absolutely phenomenal. Having this facility for all ages and abilities is something that I wish I had when I was younger.ldquoIrsquove been asked to open the garden and Irsquom honoured to be at the school. Irsquove read up a little about it and what theyrsquore doing is outstanding.Caroline Williams, headteacher of primary at Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoThe dedication and hard work of all the volunteers was incredible under dficult conditions, with lots of clay and concrete to dig through. The space was sad and neglected before and now is interesting, welcoming and inviting truly a space for all our learners to explore their senses. The pupils loved exploring it for the first time on Saturday during the official opening.ldquoWe canrsquot thank the teams enough who have brought this project together Barratt David Homes and their volunteers for the financial support and labour, Dunn Landscapes who managed the work daily, Pam Creed for her design and Pughrsquos Garden centre for the donation of the plants, as well as KidsOut for the donation of the musical instruments.Barratt Homes and David Wilson Homes managing director Steve Williams said: ldquoEveryone at Barratt gets a day off to volunteer for a charity. So we looked for a project that we could all do together to really make a dference. From the company  people volunteered to work on the project. Itrsquos fair to say we all got a lot out of it. It really warms our hearts to see what wersquove been able to do in four weeks.Blisse Mellons, , and her mother Laura were already using the gardens. ldquoShe likes this one a lot. She likes to scratch stuff, said Mrs Mellons. ldquoItrsquos good for the wheelchairs and itrsquos a great height.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people.

Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

three, graduated with a . in Business Information Systems on July .The -year-old attended Ceara School in Lurgan for two years before transferring to Richmount Primary on the Moy Road and then to Donacloney Primary to finish his primary education.Praising the educators who supported her son in his early years, Joel’s mother Rhonda said: “When Joel started Ceara, he didn’t have many communication skills. After his two years there his communication skills had improved and he was able to move into mainstream education. He’d been introduced to the schedule system and this helped immensely.“Joel received support from a classroom assistant at Richmount and also when he moved to Donacloney. Joel then moved to Dromore High. He worked hard in his GCSEs and A levels and was able to go on to study at Magee. We’re very proud of what he has achieved.”Although Joel’s graduation was a chance to celebrate his educational successes, it was also an emotional day for the family. Rhonda added: “My mother Margaret Boyd passed away before Joel’s graduation. She had bought Joel’s laptop that he used at Magee and had been very supportive during his educational journey. She had prayed for him every day and would have been very proud to see Joel graduate.”Following his graduation, Joel received assistance from his university mentor and has been successful in getting a job at Lloyds Bank in Belfast- a role he commences this week.Rhonda concluded: “We hope parents of children with special needs or autism can be encouraged by Joel’s journey. He’s worked hard and remained focused on what he wanted. We wish to thank the Southern Education Board, his teachers and classroom assistants and his mentor and lecturers at university.”Memorial to two IRA men killed in Loughgall razed to the groundMystery

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/NI-Chamber-President.jpg","title":"ni politicians must not waste time amid restoration talks","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s politicians “must not waste time” amid ongoing talks at restoring an Executive while business here should employ the “collaborative vision” that saw industries grow following the Good Friday Agreement.

That’s a welcome step forward. But after two years without movement of any kind, we shouldn’t expect results in a hurry.” Speaking about the Chamber’s attempt to host the World Chambers Congress, he said: “Less than two weeks ago, NI Chamber along with the British Chamber of Commerce and Chambers Ireland were in Rio at the World Chambers Congress, showcasing Northern Ireland as a potential host for the conference in . “Held every two years in a dferent region of the world, the World Chambers Congress provides unparalleled opportunities to connect and strengthen relations with a erse and international group of iniduals representing more than  countries. “The bid,successful, could bring an estimated economic value of £.m to Northern Ireland and we were joined in Rio by our strategic partners including Invest Northern Ireland, Belfast City Council, Visit Belfast and ICC Belfast.” Those attending the lunch also heard from Eddie O’Sullivan, former head coach to the Irish national rugby team, and gaelic football legend Pat Spillane.
