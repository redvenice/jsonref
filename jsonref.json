Too many people have called me, too many cops I’ve spoken to, that there’s no way it wasn’t discussed.\u0027The director says a law enforcement officer warned him to get a burner phone and cover the camera on his computer. It has caused him to check his doors at night out of fear for what could happen to him. A former FBI agent who also spoke to the publication says Biggie Smalls\u0027 mother, Voletta Wallace, could \u0027absolutely completely bury\u0027 the Los Angeles Police Department if Johnny Depp\u0027s movie City of Lies was released and created a buzz.The family was seeking $400million in a 2002 wrongful death lawsuit that was dismissed 2012 but is eligible to be refiled. Speculation about the reason for the movie being shut down continued in writing, the story states. \u0027Also, they were being warned, even threatened, with the consequences of releasing a film that pointed such a large and sharp finger at the LAPD, and that would put the City of Los Angeles at risk of tremendous liability,\u0027 Sullivan wrote in an email to Furman, reports The Daily Beast. \u0027I’ve seen up close how powerful those threats can be.\u0027    City of Lies is about the investigations into Notorious B.I.G (left) and Tupac\u0027s (right) murders          Director, David Furman, expresses how annoyed he is the lead actor was being used as reason for City of Lies getting blockedIt\u0027s what he goes into in his forthcoming book. \u0027I describe the frightening political machinations that prevented the federal case of LAPD involvement in the Biggie murder from being prosecuted. Truly outrageous,\u0027 he told the publication about Dead Wrong.Depp plays a role Leonardo DiCaprio was originally taking.However Sullivan thinks Global Road - that Variety reports could be facing bankruptcy - spent money on sci-fi film A.X.L instead.   Also starring Forest Whitaker, City of Lies is about the investigation into the killing of Biggie, aka Notorious B.I.G., which was shut down in 2005 due to lack of evidence. It also surrounds the slaying of his rival Tupac Shakur.           Trouble: While Johnny Depp doesn\u0027t necessarily deny assaulting Gregg \u0027Rocky\u0027 Brooks on the City of Lies set, his actions were out of self-defense, according to The Blast seen in 2017Depp\u0027s attorney later shared a statement to DailyMail.com: \u0027Despite false media reports suggesting otherwise, Johnny Depp never touched the person suing him, as over a dozen witnesses present will attest. In a court filing we have generally denied all claims and we will fight these latest sham allegations.\u0027In Gregg\u0027s legal documents, the crew member slammed the Lone Ranger star over his conduct, alleging the actions were \u0027intentional and malicious and done for the purpose of causing plaintiff to suffer humiliation.\u0027Brooks also claimed Johnny\u0027s \u0027intoxication and temper created a hostile, abusive and unsafe work environment,\u0027 which eventually resulted in him being assaulted by Johnny during filming of the crime thriller when he tried to enforce a permit restriction during a late night of filming.Gregg claimed he was eventually fired from the movie when he refused to sign a release waiving his right to sue over the incident.His attorney, Arbella Azizian, said in a statement: \u0027My client wants to make sure Mr. Depp is held accountable for his conduct on set so that, in the future, others will not be put in the same situation.\u0027          Action: City of Lies - which is based around the murder investigations of Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur - was originally scheduled to be released next month, but has been axedJohnny Depp Claims Alleged Assault on \u0027City of Lies\u0027 Was Self-DefenseGlobal Road in Crisis: Banks Take Control of Studio – Variety"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/24/20/4F5DA88200000578-0-image-a-3_1535138620534.jpg","title":"Manchester Pride 2018 need know Big Weekend","story":"Sunday may be a wash out.

So, I just respected John and he had a huge heart you know.\u0027  Sarah said McCain had agreed with her about not letting other people \u0027mold you into something you\u0027re not.\u0027\u0027You can\u0027t do that. You can\u0027t be insincere and not genuine and accomplish what needs to be done, but yeah, that was a huge lesson,\u0027 she said.  \u0027If it was just John McCain and me, or just our families together it was awesome. Those were the good times. \u0027When asked on what she believed was McCain\u0027s political legacy, she said the senator will be remembered in high respects for his military service. \u0027The unfortunate part about it will be that I think some of the people around him- still try to undermine us.          McCain and Cindy had four children together - Meghan (center), Jack and James, in addition to adopting a daughter, Bridget, from Bangladesh  The senator has been battling cancer for the past year and relocated indefinitely to his home in Arizona last December. He is pictured right with his daughter Meghan  \u0027Part of that legacy unfortunately will be some of these people that had influence on him will, unfortunately, they really took advantage of, and that wasn\u0027t good. The former governor and her husband also spoke out against claims that McCain had regretted picking her as his running mate.The 81-year-old revealed in his memoir, The Restless Wave, published in April, that he wished he had chosen Connecticut Senator Joseph Lieberman as his VP instead.In an earlier interview with DailyMailTV in May, Palin had said she attributed his statements to \u0027his ghostwriters.\u0027\u0027I was reading part of his book and he had nothing but praise her. He had one little sentence where he was saying maybe I should have picked Joe,\u0027 Todd said. \u0027Four-five little words. He praised her and how he selected her, but that\u0027s how it works…that\u0027s how the perception in the media works.\u0027 Sarah reiterated that McCain had never told her those sentiments himself. \u0027Well, with that headline though that he evidently regretted picking me, well my thought was, well he\u0027s never said that to me.\u0027We\u0027ve always had great conversations and thankfulness that I accepted the opportunity, and was given the opportunity. It\u0027s all been good.           Then Republican presidential candidate John McCain (C) greets family members of his running mate, vice presidential candidate and Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, upon his arrival to attend the Republican National Convention in Minneapolis in 2008\u0027I had never heard that from him before and…it\u0027s a shame to live life with regrets especially like that, that would be a huge regret. That\u0027s life-changing, nation-changing regret. Let it be a lesson that we not live life with regrets.\u0027 The two had kept in touch over the years after their failed campaign despite their differences, Palin said. \u0027We\u0027ve always had great conversations- and we\u0027ve been able to agree to disagree, certainly on political issues.John McCain, 81, halts his medical care: Senator\u0027s daughter...Melania to leave her mark on the White House grounds by...Share this article"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/25/01/4F5FB25500000578-6096279-image-a-62_1535157745799.jpg","title":"Corbyn defends Zionists comment Tories report standards watchdog","story":"Mike Gapes, a former chairman of the foreign affairs committee (right), has slammed Jeremy Corbyn over a video of him making controversial comments in 2013 (still from video on left)The Conservatives have reported Mr Corbyn to the parliamentary standards watchdog over a video of him at the Palestinian Return Centre in 2013.Speaking at the London conference  promoted by the propaganda website of terror group Hamas, he said British Zionists did not \u0027understand English irony\u0027.Mr Gapes, who has previously been targeted by online trolls after he suffered a heart attack, told fellow MPs: \u0027I am not prepared to support the racist antisemite.

This afternoon he met Ireland\u0027s first gay prime minister.Tens of thousands gathered in Dublin as he passed through in his Popemobile, a Skoda Rapid model, waving and smiling to the crowds on Dame Street. But demonstrators also assembled around the city to protest against clerical crimes, amid a row over the Vatican\u0027s response to similar claims of institutional abuse in America.

I myself share those sentiments.\u0027 \u0027It is my hope that the gravity of the abuse scandals, which have cast light on the failings of many, will serve to emphasise the importance of the protection of minors and vulnerable adults on the part of society as a whole,\u0027 he said. He also praised his predecessor, Benedict XVI, for tackling the issue, saying: \u0027His frank and decisive intervention continues to serve as an incentive for the efforts of the church\u0027s leadership both to remedy past mistakes and to adopt stringent norms meant to ensure that they do not happen again.\u0027 Mr Varadkar said he hoped the papal visit would mark a \u0027new chapter\u0027 in Ireland\u0027s relationship with the Catholic Church.In his speech to the pope at Dublin Castle, he said both church and state had a history of \u0027sorrow and shame,\u0027 and he urged the pope to ensure that victims of sex abuse find \u0027justice and truth and healing\u0027.Varadkar cited the recent Pennsylvania grand jury report, which found 300 priests had abused more than 1,000 children over 70 years in six dioceses, in urging Francis to \u0027ensure that from words flow actions\u0027.Pope to pray before relics of Ireland\u0027s \u0027holy drinker\u0027 Matt...British tourists are hunted by Italian police after...A third of families in Ireland no longer fit the Catholic...Share this article\u0027In recent weeks, we have all listened to heart-breaking stories from Pennsylvania of brutal crimes perpetrated by people within the Catholic Church, and then obscured to protect the institution at the expense of innocent victims,\u0027 Varadkar said. \u0027It\u0027s a story all too tragically familiar here in Ireland.\u0027The taoiseach added: \u0027The Ireland of the 21st century is a very different place today than it was in the past. Ireland is increasingly erse.  \u0027One in six of us were not born here and there are more and more people who adhere to other faiths, or who are comfortable in declaring that they subscribe to no organised religion.\u0027We have voted in our parliament and by referendum to modernise our laws – understanding that marriages do not always work, that women should make their own decisions and that families come in many forms including those headed by a grandparent, lone parent or same-sex parents or parents who are orced.\u0027He added: \u0027Holy Father, I believe that the time has now come for us to build a new relationship between church and state in Ireland – a new covenant for the 21st century. It is my hope that your visit marks the opening of a new chapter in the relationship between Ireland and the Catholic Church.\u0027Building on our intertwined history, and learning from our shared mistakes, it can be one in which religion is no longer at the centre of our society, but in which it still has an important place.\u0027            The Popemobile and its convoy drive through the streets of Dublin today greeted by cheering crowds of well-wishers           Pope Francis waves to the faithful on his popemobile in Dublin where thousands of people greeted the 81-year-old pontiff          Pope Francis greets the public as he travels through the city in the Popemobile, a converted Skoda Rapid, on Saturday          Pope Francis waves to admirers as his Popemobile carries the 81-year-old pontiff through the streets of Dublin today           The Pope puts his hand to his head before he speaks alongside Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at St Patrick\u0027s Hall in Dublin today           Pope Francis, centre, is flanked by Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, right, as they arrive to make speeches in Dublin today    Pope Francis meets with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Dublin Castle where they spoke about historical sex abuse     Pope Francis meets the President of Ireland Michael D.

Mr Millett was the only blogger covering the event. In a statement released on Friday evening Mr Corbyn said he had been defending the ambassador from \u0027what I thought were deliberate misrepresentations\u0027 by people \u0027for whom English was a first language, when it isn\u0027t for the ambassador\u0027.Mr Corbyn said: \u0027I described those pro-Israel activists as Zionists, in the accurate political sense and not as a euphemism for Jewish people - and that is made clear in the rest of my speech that day.\u0027I am now more careful with how I might use the term \u0027Zionist\u0027 because a once self-identifying political term has been increasingly hijacked by anti-Semites as code for Jews.\u0027Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger had earlier said that the video contained \u0027inexcusable comments\u0027 which made her feel \u0027unwelcome in my own party\u0027.

The event was advertised online by Hamas\u0027 Al-Qassam Brigades, which is designated a terrorist group by Britain, the EU, the United States and other countries.In one of the speeches, made by 911 conspiracy theorist Alan Hart, \u0027Zionism\u0027 was described as a \u0027cancer at the heart of international affairs\u0027. It was also called a \u0027monster\u0027 and compared to Nazi Germany. Several speakers were connected to Hamas.

Just before midnight on Saturday, as the liner rounded the northern coast of Croatia, she disappeared overboard, plunging 75ft from the seventh deck into the sea – and hitting the water with such force that she injured her right cheek.Yet this was to be a story with a happy – many would say miraculous – ending. When hope was all but lost after ten long hours, Miss Longstaff, on the cusp of giving up, was spotted and plucked to safety. Hollywood could not have scripted it better.This much is not in dispute. It was whether she jumped or accidentally fell (foul play was quickly ruled out) that became the subject of international intrigue.Today, after a week of claim and counter-claim, The Mail on Sunday can reveal that investigators in both Croatia and Italy – where the Norwegian Star was bound – have completed their inquiries and concluded that Miss Longstaff, an air stewardess, did indeed jump.They found that she did so \u0027voluntarily\u0027 – and in a \u0027determined\u0027 fashion. Yet the mystery of what prompted her drastic action remains, as do a number of unanswered questions.Her father has suggested that she had recently \u0027been going through a very hard time\u0027. Inevitably some will conclude, therefore, that this was a cry for help – or worse.          \u0027Kay from England\u0027 is escorted by rescuers from a Croatian Coast Guard vessel in Pula port last weekend Perhaps the row with her partner played a part. Perhaps she was blind drunk – they\u0027d been drinking all day after all – and didn\u0027t know what she was doing. And maybe she simply can\u0027t remember.So far all that she has said is that she \u0027fell off the back\u0027 of the liner. For now, Miss Longstaff does not seem minded to enlighten anyone further. Save for her balcony appearances, she has been holed up inside her apartment near the city of Malaga for most of the week, refusing to come to the door – quite possibly determined to put her embarrassing moment in the spotlight behind her.She will be gratified to learn that she will not have to contribute towards the cost of her rescue, which involved an aircraft and three patrolling vessels. The bill is thought to run to several hundred thousand pounds.Croatia\u0027s Ministry of Maritime Affairs said \u0027international agreements\u0027 prevent Croatia from forcing the woman to pay up.Tellingly, perhaps, this was a great concern of Miss Longstaff. Minutes after the rescue, she asked directly whether she would have to foot the bill. \u0027Where will I find the money for that?\u0027 she asked Lovro Oreskovic, captain of the Cavtat, one of the patrol boats.Mr Oreskovic said: \u0027It was one of the first things she asked us. We assured her that she would have nothing to pay.\u0027Lawyer Mark Lee, a travel litigation specialist, said passengers who missed flights because of the rescue would have to rely on their own travel insurance. And he said: \u0027I think it\u0027s unlikely that anyone could successfully recover damages from the lady who jumped – and even if they did, she is unlikely to have sufficient funds to satisfy any awards against her.\u0027          Pictured is the Golf Beach 3 Benalmadena apartment block where Kay Longstaff and Craig Rayment liveNone of Miss Longstaff\u0027s family members are prepared to speak about what happened, though her father called her a heroine and said he could not \u0027imagine her jumping\u0027.Others disagreed. One crew member suggested she leapt after scaling railings on the edge of the deck. The mother of the liner company boss called her a \u0027stupid woman\u0027 and insisted she jumped. CCTV footage apparently appeared to support this version. But on Friday, the mystery took another turn with a report that part of the wooden handrail around the ship was missing. Could she have fallen, after all?A source involved in the investigation told The Mail on Sunday: \u0027The CCTV footage shows that she was on the seventh deck of Norwegian Star when she put her bag with belongings on a table. She started to take off her clothes. She did not seem nervous. If anything, it looked rather routine. She stopped for a few moments and then jumped in a very determined way – preventing her hitting the ship or getting sucked in by an engine.\u0027It is not clear when the alarm was first raised but at some point the liner doubled back to look for her. The search and rescue operation was launched at 2.17am on Sunday after the captain filed a missing person report.          Kay Longstaff (pictured in a red dress) is seen hugging a friend in her hotel in Venice where she stayed last week          Kay Longstaff had job with private jet operator NetJets, she looked after high profile celebritiesMiss Longstaff, meanwhile, survived by floating on her back – and singing. Her fitness from yoga helped and the water, lit by a half moon, was unusually warm.Further details of her rescue emerged yesterday. It has been reported that because she wasn\u0027t wearing a lifejacket, she was missed by circling aircraft.On Sunday morning, numerous passing vessels also missed her. By then her voice had become strained. \u0027She was waving and trying to shout, but her voice was lost as she was obviously using it during the night,\u0027 said a member of the rescue team.Miss Longstaff was finally located at 9.40am on Sunday less than a mile from where she disappeared.\u0027She said she didn\u0027t have the strength to keep floating for much longer,\u0027 said Mr Oreskovic. \u0027She first took some water, then had soup. We also gave her an isotonic drink and finally a pudding before she fell asleep.\u0027Two police investigations were launched. In Venice, where the liner eventually docked many hours behind schedule, prosecutor Roberto Terzo oversaw a cursory inquiry. When officers presented him with their findings, he quickly decided to \u0027close his file\u0027. A spokesman for his office pointed out that the incident happened in Croatian territorial waters. In any case, he added, no crime was committed, adding: \u0027She jumped voluntarily.\u0027Across the Adriatic in the Croatian city of Pula, officers were rapidly reaching the same conclusion.Officially, at least, Miss Longstaff\u0027s extraordinary adventure is over. It is thought she will return to work this week.          Kay Longstaff jumped 75ft from the seventh deck into sea - injuring her cheek as she hit waterShe had long harboured an ambition to live abroad and moved to Spain after tiring of the British climate, getting a job with private jet operator NetJets. Former Premier League footballer Bastian Schweinsteiger, Formula 1 racing drivers and socialite Tamara Ecclestone are said to have been among the clients she looked after.Miss Longstaff and her partner returned home to Torrequebrada on Tuesday– she spent Sunday and Monday night under observation in hospital in Pula, where doctors assessed her psychiatric condition. They then travelled to Venice where she spoke to Italian police, and was seen returning to her hotel with Mr Rayment after dinner.She was later spirited through Malaga airport by police. Since then she has kept a low profile.But by Friday afternoon, the couple seemed in the mood to relax and were spotted sunbathing on their terrace.Miss Longstaff, wearing a pink bikini top and sunglasses and with her blonde hair tied back, sipped from an outsized teacup.One neighbour said of the couple: \u0027They are very nice people. Kay is a beautiful English lady and always says \u0027Hello\u0027. They are never any trouble.\u0027Meanwhile, a friend suggested Miss Longstaff was \u0027desperately upset\u0027 about disrupting the travel plans of other Norwegian Star passengers. The friend said: \u0027She is clearly very embarrassed about what happened.\u0027I think it is pretty obvious that there was a bit of alcohol involved and she was not thinking straight.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/13/00/4F095BC600000578-0-image-m-6_1534118158720.jpg","title":"Spencer Matthews signs Michelin starred chef help win MasterChef","story":"    Spencer Matthews with his wife Vogue WilliamsThe recipe is simple but appealing – well-known stars struggle to conquer challenging cooking techniques in a bid to be crowned Celebrity MasterChef.And few things make more entertaining viewing than a hapless amateur who doesn’t know his braising from his blanching.But now The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Pippa Middleton’s brother-in-law Spencer Matthews has been going against the spirit of the show – by having secret lessons with multi-Michelin-starred chef Jean-Christophe Novelli.The pair were introduced by his father David, a millionaire businessman who owns the £5,000- a-night Eden Rock hotel on St Barts in the Caribbean.Sources on the set of the BBC1 show, which started last week, say the 29-year-old former Made In Chelsea star told the other 19 contestants he had sought expert assistance because he was ultra-competitive and wanted to stay in the competition for as long as possible.It is believed to be the first time that a contestant has been rumbled in this way.Pregnant Pippa Middleton is pictured with her father-in-law...Top of the Toffs! \u0027Elitist\u0027 dating app for ex-private school...Share this articleA source said: ‘Spencer was making no secret that he wanted to do well – so much so that he used his connections to get ahead. \u0027He was boasting to the others that he’d got some expert help.

We had Trump nailed.’Indeed, The Mail on Sunday has learned that the files contained alleged details of:l At least a dozen affairs and pay-offs – some for acts of sexual misconduct – to women including models and Playboy playmatesl A $30,000 payment to ‘Dino the doorman’, a member of Trump’s staff, who claimed he knew about one of the affairs          Donald Trump with Stormy Daniels in 2006l So-called ‘catch and kill’ projects which allowed the tabloids to seek favours from celebrities including an unnamed British star, Tiger Woods and Arnold Schwarzenegger in return for burying potentially damaging allegations about them.For many years the brash deliverer of scoops, The Enquirer last week found itself making, rather than breaking, the news.Mr Howard and David Pecker, chairman of American Media Inc, the owner of The Enquirer, were both granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for information related to ‘hush money’ payments made to the porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal by AMI and Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen. Both women claim to have had affairs with Trump – which he denies – and were both allegedly paid for their silence in the run-up to the 2016 US elections.Trump has always vehemently denied all allegations of affairs and sexual misconduct leveled against him, dismissing the claims as ‘fake news’ and ‘lies’ spread by those seeking to discredit him.In the case of McDougal, it is claimed that The Enquirer executed a ‘catch and kill’, whereby it paid money for her story without having any intention of publishing it in order to protect Trump.Federal prosecutors are now examining whether Trump violated any of America’s strict campaign finance laws by approving the catch and kill payments to his alleged mistresses.          IMMUNITY: David Pecker, chairman of AMI, which owns The National Enquirer, with two Playboy bunniesThe involvement of The Enquirer emerged during a dramatic week in which Trump’s former lawyer Cohen – who arranged payments of $130,000 to Daniels and $150,000 to McDougal – pleaded guilty to eight charges, including campaign finance violations.In a clear reference to Trump, Cohen said he had been directed to break federal election laws by ‘a candidate for federal office’.In a further blow to the President, his former campaign manager Paul Manafort was last week found guilty of tax evasion and bank fraud.And Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump organisation, who is said to hold the key to the businessman’s financial and tax affairs, was also offered immunity from prosecution in return for cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller.Oscar-winner Kate Winslet to welcome movie cameras into her...Tommy Robinson is seen for the first time since his release...\u0027You can never take away her superpowers\u0027: Nike defends...Labour members who questioned the loyalty of British Jews...Share this articleIt is Mueller’s probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election that triggered what former Enquirer bureau chief Jerry George called: ‘The implosion of the Trump presidency.’Mr George, who worked for The Enquirer for 28 years, claimed: ‘Trump’s history of philandering was legendary.‘In the days before David Pecker took over in 1999, Trump would get caught out having affairs... but he would trade stories with us, saying, “If you don’t run this about me, I can give you this story about one of my rich friends.”‘He always had a certain type – porn stars, Playmates, beauty queens. Sometimes we worked with him, sometimes we didn’t.‘He would ring up and offer stories on his celebrity friends and business associates in exchange for us killing negative stories about his philandering. All the files were stored in the Lantana warehouse, with contacts written down on paper the old-fashioned way – source notes, original copies of contracts and pay-offs if they were made.‘Trump should be very worried about those files.‘The Enquirer ended up becoming Trump’s private mouthpiece. The irony is The Enquirer could end up bringing him down.’    Close Friends: Trump with David Pecker in 2004. David Pecker, chairman of American Media Inc, the owner of The Enquirer, was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for information related to ‘hush money’ payments made to the porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal by AMI and Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen‘With Trump, there was a history of catch and kill – at least a dozen women over the years were paid off.’ The Enquirer has not commented on the fresh claims but has previously insisted that stories were published solely on editorial judgment.It also emerged this weekend that Dino Sajudin – a former doorman at Trump World Tower in New York – was paid $30,000 by The Enquirer after approaching the tabloid with a ‘rumour’ about Trump’s sex life.While the claim is false, Sajudin passed a lie detector test arranged by The Enquirer, which proved he believed it to be true.‘He was paid thirty grand for a story that wasn’t true. That was pretty good going,’ said Mr George.On Friday night, Trump was in Ohio. Unbowed by the swirl of scandal, he told adoring supporters: ‘We won the election. We’re going to win again in 2020.’The fate of the cache of ‘Trump files’ remains unknown. They were moved from Lantana to a safe in The Enquirer’s New York office, but a source told The Mail on Sunday that they are no longer there, having been collected the week before Trump’s inauguration.‘They have been moved,’ the source added. ‘They may be in the hands of Robert Mueller. They may still be in Pecker’s possession. They may even have been shredded.’For the sake of Trump’s presidency and legacy, he must surely be hoping the latter is true."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/26/00/4F6725E700000578-6098645-image-m-7_1535238563479.jpg","title":"Plan line M20 portaloos queues trucks heading France event no deal Brexit","story":"    Truck drivers stand next to their vehicles on the M20 during Operation Stack on July 30, 2015To allow the drivers to relieve themselves discreetly and hygienically, portable loos would be deployed at intervals along the motorway. As with much of the Government’s no-deal planning, non-disclosure agreements have been signed with the logistics companies which arrange the supply of the loos to try to keep the arrangements secret.  Brexiteers threaten to humiliate Theresa May at Party Conference over Philip Hammond\u0027s warning that failing to reach a deal would have dire consequences for the economy The bitter Tory civil war over Brexit deepened last night after Theresa May was warned by her own MPs that she faced being booed and ‘slow-handclapped’ at the party conference in protest at her Brussels strategy.Brexiteers are furious after Philip Hammond’s warning last week that failing to reach a deal would have dire consequences for the economy – and they blame the Prime Minister for failing to rein in the Chancellor.The news comes as The Mail on Sunday has established that the plans for a no-deal Brexit include ordering hundreds of portable lavatories to be deployed on motorways, to be used by lorry drivers caught in gridlock caused by the reintroduction of EU border checks. The secret contract is understood to be one of dozens covered by non-disclosure agreements drawn up between the Government and the private sector.The Tory Party is deeply ided over the level of contingency planning required for a no-deal: Brexiteers believe that ‘doom-mongering’ predictions of economic and logistical chaos after March signal to Brussels negotiators that the UK is prepared to buckle during talks.Last night, former Brexit Minister David Jones led calls for Mrs May to sack Mr Hammond, telling The Mail on Sunday: ‘She must invite her Chancellor’s resignation and if that is not forthcoming, then she must insist upon it.’Mr Hammond’s intervention, in which he said a no-deal Brexit could hit growth of the country’s GDP by as much as 10 per cent and cost the economy £80 billion in extra borrowing, came just hours after Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab had suggested it would have only a limited impact.          Brexiteers are furious after Philip Hammond’s warning last week that failing to reach a deal would have dire consequences for the economyTensions are rising in the party ahead of MPs’ return to the Commons next month and Conservative Party Conference, which starts on September 30.A number of rebel Tory MPs say they have privately urged Boris Johnson to force a no-confidence vote in Mrs May for preparing a ‘botched’ Brexit.But allies of the former Foreign Secretary, who resigned from the Cabinet last month in protest at the Prime Minister’s Chequers agreement proposing a post-Brexit alignment with many EU rules, say he will not make his move unless the Prime Minister ‘sealed her own fate’ by making further concession to Brussels.Arch-Brexiteer Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said yesterday that the Prime Minister’s standing was already ‘at an all-time low’ with Tory members over the Chequers ‘sell-out’ and her call on Mr Johnson to apologise for controversial remarks about burkas.Mr Bridgen said: ‘Her standing has now plummeted even further. It’s becoming increasingly obvious to Conservative supporters that we need a new PM to rescue Brexit, and rescue our country and our party.‘All right-minded colleagues should put in no-confidence letters now to force out Mrs May.‘If she somehow manages to cling on, then at the Conservative conference she faces the prospect of real humiliation when she meets the party faithful.’Mr Bridgen added: ‘She could be the first sitting Tory Prime Minister I can remember who faces a slow-handclap during her speech or doesn’t get a standing ovation at the end of it. I wouldn’t be surprised if she was even booed.’Mr Jones said that the Prime Minister should dismiss her Chancellor ‘as proof of her good faith in dealing with the party’.He said that Mr Hammond had not only undermined the Brexit Secretary’s negotiations with Brussels, but was also ‘brazenly defying’ Mrs May’s instruction at last month’s Chequers summit that Cabinet Ministers now had to speak with one voice on the Government’s strategy.He contrasted Mr Hammond’s behaviour with that of David Davis and Boris Johnson, who quit within days of the Chequers summit as they could not support the agreed approach. ‘As men of principle, they both decided they could not and quickly resigned,’ he said.‘Mr Hammond clearly has a similar problem in sticking to the agreed Government position and should therefore follow suit.’          A number of rebel Tory MPs say they have privately urged Boris Johnson to force a no-confidence vote in Mrs May for preparing a ‘botched’ BrexitMrs May will face a no-confidence vote if 48 or more Tory rebels submit letters to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the party’s powerful 1922 backbench committee at Westminster. But yesterday, Sir Graham appeared to offer the beleaguered Prime Minister support, praising her humility as a politician. He said that when it came to achieving a good Brexit, ‘a politician who has as little ego as Theresa May, calmly getting on with it, may be the best chance of achieving that’.Mrs May’s allies argue that she is the only ‘captain of the ship’ who can navigate the country through the negotiations while holding the warring wings of her party together.Meanwhile, the ‘Portaloo plan’ is one of a number of secret agreements with companies and industry groups that have arisen as part of a process of consultation with logistics firms.Much of the planning work has been orchestrated by sub-committees of the Border Co-ordination Group, a cross Whitehall committee of senior officials.Mr Raab’s upbeat remarks came as the Government published the first tranche of papers spelling out its no-deal contingency plans, covering banking, medicines and clinical trials, nuclear research, workplace rights and farm payments.They represent about a third of the 80 or so technical papers that are to be released by the end of next month.He rejected claims that the Army would have to be brought in to distribute food, but warned of higher credit card charges and online shopping bills, and said that British expats were at risk of losing their pensions and access to their bank accounts.The prospect of a no-deal outcome has increased since the Chequers proposals were published – with both Brexiteer Tories and Brussels negotiators describing them as unacceptable.Yesterday, former Tory Minister Nick Boles claimed that a no-deal Brexit would be blocked by at least 40 of his fellow Conservatives in the Commons.‘I don’t care how many of my colleagues dream of this in the midnight hour. There are not the parliamentary numbers to support a no-deal Brexit,’ he said. ‘And I will vote, as a Conservative MP, in whatever way is necessary, on whatever motion will achieve the result of stopping a no-deal Brexit.’This would force Mrs May back to the negotiating table – or beg the EU for an emergency extension to the Article 50 deadline at the end of March.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/26/01/4F5EBFEB00000578-0-Liam_Gallagher_and_Debbie_Gwyther_at_Scott_s_Restaurant_in_Mayfa-a-3_1535243714551.jpg","title":"Moment Liam Gallagher grabs girlfriend Debbie Gwyther throat London club","story":"    In a video posted by the Sun, the Oasis star is seen grabbing his girlfriend by the throat The 45-year-old Mancunian said yesterday: \u0027Firstly I have never put my hands on any woman in a vicious manner.

I myself share those sentiments.\u0027 \u0027It is my hope that the gravity of the abuse scandals, which have cast light on the failings of many, will serve to emphasise the importance of the protection of minors and vulnerable adults on the part of society as a whole,\u0027 he said. He also praised his predecessor, Benedict XVI, for tackling the issue, saying: \u0027His frank and decisive intervention continues to serve as an incentive for the efforts of the church\u0027s leadership both to remedy past mistakes and to adopt stringent norms meant to ensure that they do not happen again.\u0027 Mr Varadkar said he hoped the papal visit would mark a \u0027new chapter\u0027 in Ireland\u0027s relationship with the Catholic Church.In his speech to the pope at Dublin Castle, he said both church and state had a history of \u0027sorrow and shame,\u0027 and he urged the pope to ensure that victims of sex abuse find \u0027justice and truth and healing\u0027.Varadkar cited the recent Pennsylvania grand jury report, which found 300 priests had abused more than 1,000 children over 70 years in six dioceses, in urging Francis to \u0027ensure that from words flow actions\u0027.Pope to pray before relics of Ireland\u0027s \u0027holy drinker\u0027 Matt...British tourists are hunted by Italian police after...A third of families in Ireland no longer fit the Catholic...Share this article\u0027In recent weeks, we have all listened to heart-breaking stories from Pennsylvania of brutal crimes perpetrated by people within the Catholic Church, and then obscured to protect the institution at the expense of innocent victims,\u0027 Varadkar said. \u0027It\u0027s a story all too tragically familiar here in Ireland.\u0027The taoiseach added: \u0027The Ireland of the 21st century is a very different place today than it was in the past. Ireland is increasingly erse.  \u0027One in six of us were not born here and there are more and more people who adhere to other faiths, or who are comfortable in declaring that they subscribe to no organised religion.\u0027We have voted in our parliament and by referendum to modernise our laws – understanding that marriages do not always work, that women should make their own decisions and that families come in many forms including those headed by a grandparent, lone parent or same-sex parents or parents who are orced.\u0027He added: \u0027Holy Father, I believe that the time has now come for us to build a new relationship between church and state in Ireland – a new covenant for the 21st century. It is my hope that your visit marks the opening of a new chapter in the relationship between Ireland and the Catholic Church.\u0027Building on our intertwined history, and learning from our shared mistakes, it can be one in which religion is no longer at the centre of our society, but in which it still has an important place.\u0027            The Popemobile and its convoy drive through the streets of Dublin today greeted by cheering crowds of well-wishers           Pope Francis waves to the faithful on his popemobile in Dublin where thousands of people greeted the 81-year-old pontiff          Pope Francis greets the public as he travels through the city in the Popemobile, a converted Skoda Rapid, on Saturday          Pope Francis waves to admirers as his Popemobile carries the 81-year-old pontiff through the streets of Dublin today           The Pope puts his hand to his head before he speaks alongside Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at St Patrick\u0027s Hall in Dublin today           Pope Francis, centre, is flanked by Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, right, as they arrive to make speeches in Dublin today    Pope Francis meets with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Dublin Castle where they spoke about historical sex abuse     Pope Francis meets the President of Ireland Michael D.

Mr Millett was the only blogger covering the event. In a statement released on Friday evening Mr Corbyn said he had been defending the ambassador from \u0027what I thought were deliberate misrepresentations\u0027 by people \u0027for whom English was a first language, when it isn\u0027t for the ambassador\u0027.Mr Corbyn said: \u0027I described those pro-Israel activists as Zionists, in the accurate political sense and not as a euphemism for Jewish people - and that is made clear in the rest of my speech that day.\u0027I am now more careful with how I might use the term \u0027Zionist\u0027 because a once self-identifying political term has been increasingly hijacked by anti-Semites as code for Jews.\u0027Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger had earlier said that the video contained \u0027inexcusable comments\u0027 which made her feel \u0027unwelcome in my own party\u0027.

The event was advertised online by Hamas\u0027 Al-Qassam Brigades, which is designated a terrorist group by Britain, the EU, the United States and other countries.In one of the speeches, made by 911 conspiracy theorist Alan Hart, \u0027Zionism\u0027 was described as a \u0027cancer at the heart of international affairs\u0027. It was also called a \u0027monster\u0027 and compared to Nazi Germany. Several speakers were connected to Hamas.

Just before midnight on Saturday, as the liner rounded the northern coast of Croatia, she disappeared overboard, plunging 75ft from the seventh deck into the sea – and hitting the water with such force that she injured her right cheek.Yet this was to be a story with a happy – many would say miraculous – ending. When hope was all but lost after ten long hours, Miss Longstaff, on the cusp of giving up, was spotted and plucked to safety. Hollywood could not have scripted it better.This much is not in dispute. It was whether she jumped or accidentally fell (foul play was quickly ruled out) that became the subject of international intrigue.Today, after a week of claim and counter-claim, The Mail on Sunday can reveal that investigators in both Croatia and Italy – where the Norwegian Star was bound – have completed their inquiries and concluded that Miss Longstaff, an air stewardess, did indeed jump.They found that she did so \u0027voluntarily\u0027 – and in a \u0027determined\u0027 fashion. Yet the mystery of what prompted her drastic action remains, as do a number of unanswered questions.Her father has suggested that she had recently \u0027been going through a very hard time\u0027. Inevitably some will conclude, therefore, that this was a cry for help – or worse.          \u0027Kay from England\u0027 is escorted by rescuers from a Croatian Coast Guard vessel in Pula port last weekend Perhaps the row with her partner played a part. Perhaps she was blind drunk – they\u0027d been drinking all day after all – and didn\u0027t know what she was doing. And maybe she simply can\u0027t remember.So far all that she has said is that she \u0027fell off the back\u0027 of the liner. For now, Miss Longstaff does not seem minded to enlighten anyone further. Save for her balcony appearances, she has been holed up inside her apartment near the city of Malaga for most of the week, refusing to come to the door – quite possibly determined to put her embarrassing moment in the spotlight behind her.She will be gratified to learn that she will not have to contribute towards the cost of her rescue, which involved an aircraft and three patrolling vessels. The bill is thought to run to several hundred thousand pounds.Croatia\u0027s Ministry of Maritime Affairs said \u0027international agreements\u0027 prevent Croatia from forcing the woman to pay up.Tellingly, perhaps, this was a great concern of Miss Longstaff. Minutes after the rescue, she asked directly whether she would have to foot the bill. \u0027Where will I find the money for that?\u0027 she asked Lovro Oreskovic, captain of the Cavtat, one of the patrol boats.Mr Oreskovic said: \u0027It was one of the first things she asked us. We assured her that she would have nothing to pay.\u0027Lawyer Mark Lee, a travel litigation specialist, said passengers who missed flights because of the rescue would have to rely on their own travel insurance. And he said: \u0027I think it\u0027s unlikely that anyone could successfully recover damages from the lady who jumped – and even if they did, she is unlikely to have sufficient funds to satisfy any awards against her.\u0027          Pictured is the Golf Beach 3 Benalmadena apartment block where Kay Longstaff and Craig Rayment liveNone of Miss Longstaff\u0027s family members are prepared to speak about what happened, though her father called her a heroine and said he could not \u0027imagine her jumping\u0027.Others disagreed. One crew member suggested she leapt after scaling railings on the edge of the deck. The mother of the liner company boss called her a \u0027stupid woman\u0027 and insisted she jumped. CCTV footage apparently appeared to support this version. But on Friday, the mystery took another turn with a report that part of the wooden handrail around the ship was missing. Could she have fallen, after all?A source involved in the investigation told The Mail on Sunday: \u0027The CCTV footage shows that she was on the seventh deck of Norwegian Star when she put her bag with belongings on a table. She started to take off her clothes. She did not seem nervous. If anything, it looked rather routine. She stopped for a few moments and then jumped in a very determined way – preventing her hitting the ship or getting sucked in by an engine.\u0027It is not clear when the alarm was first raised but at some point the liner doubled back to look for her. The search and rescue operation was launched at 2.17am on Sunday after the captain filed a missing person report.

Her fitness from yoga helped and the water, lit by a half moon, was unusually warm.Further details of her rescue emerged yesterday. It has been reported that because she wasn\u0027t wearing a lifejacket, she was missed by circling aircraft.On Sunday morning, numerous passing vessels also missed her. By then her voice had become strained. \u0027She was waving and trying to shout, but her voice was lost as she was obviously using it during the night,\u0027 said a member of the rescue team.Miss Longstaff was finally located at 9.40am on Sunday less than a mile from where she disappeared.\u0027She said she didn\u0027t have the strength to keep floating for much longer,\u0027 said Mr Oreskovic. \u0027She first took some water, then had soup. We also gave her an isotonic drink and finally a pudding before she fell asleep.\u0027Two police investigations were launched. In Venice, where the liner eventually docked many hours behind schedule, prosecutor Roberto Terzo oversaw a cursory inquiry. When officers presented him with their findings, he quickly decided to \u0027close his file\u0027. A spokesman for his office pointed out that the incident happened in Croatian territorial waters. In any case, he added, no crime was committed, adding: \u0027She jumped voluntarily.\u0027Across the Adriatic in the Croatian city of Pula, officers were rapidly reaching the same conclusion.Officially, at least, Miss Longstaff\u0027s extraordinary adventure is over. It is thought she will return to work this week.          Kay Longstaff jumped 75ft from the seventh deck into sea - injuring her cheek as she hit waterShe had long harboured an ambition to live abroad and moved to Spain after tiring of the British climate, getting a job with private jet operator NetJets. Former Premier League footballer Bastian Schweinsteiger, Formula 1 racing drivers and socialite Tamara Ecclestone are said to have been among the clients she looked after.Miss Longstaff and her partner returned home to Torrequebrada on Tuesday– she spent Sunday and Monday night under observation in hospital in Pula, where doctors assessed her psychiatric condition. They then travelled to Venice where she spoke to Italian police, and was seen returning to her hotel with Mr Rayment after dinner.She was later spirited through Malaga airport by police. Since then she has kept a low profile.But by Friday afternoon, the couple seemed in the mood to relax and were spotted sunbathing on their terrace.Miss Longstaff, wearing a pink bikini top and sunglasses and with her blonde hair tied back, sipped from an outsized teacup.One neighbour said of the couple: \u0027They are very nice people. Kay is a beautiful English lady and always says \u0027Hello\u0027. They are never any trouble.\u0027Meanwhile, a friend suggested Miss Longstaff was \u0027desperately upset\u0027 about disrupting the travel plans of other Norwegian Star passengers. The friend said: \u0027She is clearly very embarrassed about what happened.\u0027I think it is pretty obvious that there was a bit of alcohol involved and she was not thinking straight.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/25/22/4F652BEC00000578-0-image-m-202_1535231797438.jpg","title":"Labour members questioned loyalty British Jews investigated","story":"    Jeremy Corbyn pictured this month in EdinburghLabour members who questioned the loyalty of British Jews have been investigated as part of Labour Party internal inquiries into anti-Semitism, it was claimed last night.A former Labour investigations officer sought to lift the lid on the nature of anti-Semitism allegations within the party.Dan Hogan, who quit his party post earlier, added that he had also carried out disciplinary inquiries into party members who ‘promoted Holocaust deniers’ and praised terrorists. The revelations came as the relative of a teenager killed in a terror attack spoke of his horror that Jeremy Corbyn had once met a Hamas chief linked to the murder.Adam Ma’anit accused Labour of sinking ‘into an anti-Semitic cesspit of its own making’.In a tweet last week, Dan Hogan, who worked on Labour’s internal disciplinary inquiries, stunned MPs by revealing the nature and scale of allegations investigated. John Lennon’s half-sister reveals how he used to jam in the...Share this articleMr Hogan said: ‘I’ve done plenty of disciplinary cases against Labour members who compared Israel to the Nazis, peddled conspiracy theories about Israel, promoted Holocaust deniers, praised terrorists, and who questioned the Britishness or loyalty of British Jews.’His remarks came amid private claims from MPs that the party does not have enough staff to handle all the anti-Semitic allegations coming in.

The secret contract is understood to be one of dozens covered by non-disclosure agreements drawn up between the Government and the private sector.The Tory Party is deeply ided over the level of contingency planning required for a no-deal: Brexiteers believe that ‘doom-mongering’ predictions of economic and logistical chaos after March signal to Brussels negotiators that the UK is prepared to buckle during talks.Last night, former Brexit Minister David Jones led calls for Mrs May to sack Mr Hammond, telling The Mail on Sunday: ‘She must invite her Chancellor’s resignation and if that is not forthcoming, then she must insist upon it.’Mr Hammond’s intervention, in which he said a no-deal Brexit could hit growth of the country’s GDP by as much as 10 per cent and cost the economy £80 billion in extra borrowing, came just hours after Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab had suggested it would have only a limited impact.          Brexiteers are furious after Philip Hammond’s warning last week that failing to reach a deal would have dire consequences for the economyTensions are rising in the party ahead of MPs’ return to the Commons next month and Conservative Party Conference, which starts on September 30.A number of rebel Tory MPs say they have privately urged Boris Johnson to force a no-confidence vote in Mrs May for preparing a ‘botched’ Brexit.But allies of the former Foreign Secretary, who resigned from the Cabinet last month in protest at the Prime Minister’s Chequers agreement proposing a post-Brexit alignment with many EU rules, say he will not make his move unless the Prime Minister ‘sealed her own fate’ by making further concession to Brussels.Arch-Brexiteer Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said yesterday that the Prime Minister’s standing was already ‘at an all-time low’ with Tory members over the Chequers ‘sell-out’ and her call on Mr Johnson to apologise for controversial remarks about burkas.Mr Bridgen said: ‘Her standing has now plummeted even further. It’s becoming increasingly obvious to Conservative supporters that we need a new PM to rescue Brexit, and rescue our country and our party.‘All right-minded colleagues should put in no-confidence letters now to force out Mrs May.‘If she somehow manages to cling on, then at the Conservative conference she faces the prospect of real humiliation when she meets the party faithful.’Mr Bridgen added: ‘She could be the first sitting Tory Prime Minister I can remember who faces a slow-handclap during her speech or doesn’t get a standing ovation at the end of it. I wouldn’t be surprised if she was even booed.’Mr Jones said that the Prime Minister should dismiss her Chancellor ‘as proof of her good faith in dealing with the party’.He said that Mr Hammond had not only undermined the Brexit Secretary’s negotiations with Brussels, but was also ‘brazenly defying’ Mrs May’s instruction at last month’s Chequers summit that Cabinet Ministers now had to speak with one voice on the Government’s strategy.He contrasted Mr Hammond’s behaviour with that of David Davis and Boris Johnson, who quit within days of the Chequers summit as they could not support the agreed approach. ‘As men of principle, they both decided they could not and quickly resigned,’ he said.‘Mr Hammond clearly has a similar problem in sticking to the agreed Government position and should therefore follow suit.’          A number of rebel Tory MPs say they have privately urged Boris Johnson to force a no-confidence vote in Mrs May for preparing a ‘botched’ BrexitMrs May will face a no-confidence vote if 48 or more Tory rebels submit letters to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the party’s powerful 1922 backbench committee at Westminster. But yesterday, Sir Graham appeared to offer the beleaguered Prime Minister support, praising her humility as a politician. He said that when it came to achieving a good Brexit, ‘a politician who has as little ego as Theresa May, calmly getting on with it, may be the best chance of achieving that’.Mrs May’s allies argue that she is the only ‘captain of the ship’ who can navigate the country through the negotiations while holding the warring wings of her party together.Meanwhile, the ‘Portaloo plan’ is one of a number of secret agreements with companies and industry groups that have arisen as part of a process of consultation with logistics firms.Much of the planning work has been orchestrated by sub-committees of the Border Co-ordination Group, a cross Whitehall committee of senior officials.Mr Raab’s upbeat remarks came as the Government published the first tranche of papers spelling out its no-deal contingency plans, covering banking, medicines and clinical trials, nuclear research, workplace rights and farm payments.They represent about a third of the 80 or so technical papers that are to be released by the end of next month.He rejected claims that the Army would have to be brought in to distribute food, but warned of higher credit card charges and online shopping bills, and said that British expats were at risk of losing their pensions and access to their bank accounts.The prospect of a no-deal outcome has increased since the Chequers proposals were published – with both Brexiteer Tories and Brussels negotiators describing them as unacceptable.Yesterday, former Tory Minister Nick Boles claimed that a no-deal Brexit would be blocked by at least 40 of his fellow Conservatives in the Commons.‘I don’t care how many of my colleagues dream of this in the midnight hour. There are not the parliamentary numbers to support a no-deal Brexit,’ he said. ‘And I will vote, as a Conservative MP, in whatever way is necessary, on whatever motion will achieve the result of stopping a no-deal Brexit.’This would force Mrs May back to the negotiating table – or beg the EU for an emergency extension to the Article 50 deadline at the end of March.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/26/01/4F5EBFEB00000578-0-Liam_Gallagher_and_Debbie_Gwyther_at_Scott_s_Restaurant_in_Mayfa-a-3_1535243714551.jpg","title":"Moment Liam Gallagher grabs girlfriend Debbie Gwyther throat London club","story":"    In a video posted by the Sun, the Oasis star is seen grabbing his girlfriend by the throat The 45-year-old Mancunian said yesterday: \u0027Firstly I have never put my hands on any woman in a vicious manner.

He persuaded the collector to lead him around her Venice, which she did, in red stockings and with a pair of lapdogs, staring into his lens from behind moth-inspired sunglasses made for her by the American artist Edward Melcarth.Peggy – she never needed the surname – fed the pigeons in St Mark’s Square, promenaded by the Bridge of Sighs, took Moses on her regular early evening cruise in her private water taxi with its red leather seats, and lounged on a chaise at her Grand Canal home and gallery, the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni. Fifty years later, those pictures, and shots of her private collection, have been reproduced in Encounters With Peggy\u0026nbspGuggenheim.Moses’s indelible subject had long made herself a reputation for legendary encounters. In this photograph, as in life, Peggy appeared determined to remind the viewer of a past that involved a rumoured thousand love affairs with everyone from Samuel Beckett to Marcel Duchamp, and the inspired patronage of a generation of American and European artists.Aside from this very public image, though, there is a sense that she also connected with Moses as a survivor. The photographer, who died in February this year, had escaped from a Nazi labour camp in his teens before establishing himself as a pre-eminent chronicler of postwar German society. Guggenheim’s own war had involved not only smuggling her art collection out of Europe and away from the Nazis, but also helping to save the lives of artists including Max Ernst (later her husband) and André Breton by getting them to New York. Peggy liked to call Venice a “living work of art” as she approached her last decade, she was coming to think of herself in the same way.Encounters With Peggy Guggenheim by Stefan Moses is out on 20 September (Hardie Grant, £22.50).

It’s rare that a novel elicits such ferocious and unmitigated awe from just about everyone you know, whether male, female, millennial or middle aged, my family included. It was hard to believe that the author was still in her 20s and even harder to imagine that she could ever write anything better. But she has. In fact, in almost every way, this new novel leaves that first book in the shade.At first sight, the territory isn’t all that different. A twisting tale of on-off-on lovers, told over several years in a series of haltingly tender, endlessly misfiring conversations and even more tenderly misfiring sexual encounters. But where Rooney’s first novel was tight, slender, cool and (admirably) restrained, this one’s a whole lot more generous, expansive and explicit, as well as, actually, more controlled. It’s also deeply and unashamedly romantic, but in the most rapturously contemporary sense.Marianne and Connell – clever, sensitive, awkward teenagers – go to the same school in Sligo, but Marianne lives in the “white mansion with a driveway”, where Connell’s mother works as a cleaner. Regularly thrown into each other’s company when Connell comes to pick his mother up, the two constantly wrestle with their feelings. Connell doesn’t think Marianne likes him much, but he’s keenly aware of the sense of “total privacy” between them, and the fact that when (often) they slide into embarrassed laughter “they couldn’t look at each other ... they had to look into corners of the room, or at their feet”. It’s a surprise to them both (though not really to us) when they begin a hesitant, clandestine relationship. The latter because Marianne is considered at school to be a misfit, equally feared and mocked by the crueller members of their friendship group. But far from being indignant that Connell won’t own up to their liaison, our heroine – for reasons that will dawn slowly and chillingly as the novel unfolds – seems to accept it as her lot.When both get places at Trinity College Dublin, it’s the start of a protracted will-they-won’t-they? love affair, with the two relentlessly, often wretchedly, ricocheting between sexual involvement, furious dumping and a touchingly easy friendship. You read on, with your breath held and only one blazing question in mind. How long is it going to take this pair of star-crossed lovers to find out what the rest of us have understood from page one: that they belong together?It’s rare that I feel as daunted by the subtlety and complexity of a novel’s trajectory as by its near-perfect narrative execution, but in this case I doubt I’ll be alone.Structurally, it’s uniquely clever, purporting to be straightforward – even downright linear – with chapters headed “One Month Later” or even, in one case, “Five Minutes Later”, while actually slyly and constantly looping back on itself, revisiting past moments and conversations and events (along with their contingent confusion, regrets and anxieties) in a way that not only illuminates the present, but also creates a delectable, mounting suspense. A simple enough trick, perhaps – not showy, not post-modern, not meta – but it feels like nothing you’ve come across before.And then there’s the dialogue. Exactly as in her first novel, Rooney’s ear for the self-deluding fumblings of millennial dialogue, her wackily candid one-liners, her ability to mine both the comedy and the tragedy from any simple human interaction, are at once dazzlingly contemporary and enjoyably timeless. More than once, struck by her capacity for creating sparky, semi-erotic, verbal tension from mere discussion between a man and a woman, I was reminded of Jane Austen – think Pride and Prejudice with hangovers and finals thrown in.But what’s most extraordinary and moving about this novel is the portrait of modern male psyche at its heart. Rooney’s Marianne is a beautifully realised – and beautiful – heroine, absolutely and defiantly able to be herself, rising always above the queasy mire of her background (her wealth and privilege are unsettlingly tinged with physical and emotional abuse), in a way that constantly unnerves those around her, not least Connell.But it’s Connell who’s the stunning creation, achingly convincing in his maleness and his struggle to understand, and find an outlet for, his feelings. Intelligent, vulnerable and hopelessly incoherent, he is, in many ways, as fatally constrained by his own gender as Marianne seems, to some extent anyway, to be freed by hers.Connell loves Marianne but does not know how to be with her, can’t own up to his emotions, can’t give her what she needs – but neither can he exist without her. Safely ensconced with a new, dull girlfriend who makes him feel more uncomplicatedly happy (or so he tells himself), he sends ever more lengthy emails to Marianne. On one pungently observed occasion, he dreams up a good phrase and gets ready to write to her “only to remember that he can’t email her when she’s downstairs”.This is a beautiful novel with a deep and satisfying intelligence at its heart. It’s emotionally and sexually admirably frank (Marianne’s masochistic streak takes her down some dark paths), but also kind and wise, witty and warm. In the end, a little like Rooney’s first book, it’s a sympathetic yet pithy examination of the myriad ways in which men and women try – and all too often fail – to understand each other.But what lifts it beyond Conversations is that there’s so much hope here. Marianne has “never believed herself fit to be loved by any person” but Connell has set her free from that place and, whatever happens next, it’s clear that this effect will be long-lasting. In fact, perhaps the question of whether these two will end up together isn’t even the real question. Love changes us, but it also frees us and, as Rooney asserts here so very triumphantly, no one can take that away.• Normal People by Sally Rooney is published by Faber \u0026amp Faber (£14.99).

Created in 2010 on the site of the old Eastern Curve railway line, it has a vegetable and herb patch, a pizza oven and a greenhouse used for workshops in the winter months.Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden, LeedsDespite the name, Hyde Park in Leeds has one of the lowest ratios of green space to grey (built-up environments) in the UK, which is why the Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden is so loved by students and locals alike. Whether edible or medicinal, all of the plants here have a use, and visitors are encouraged to take what they find – with a request that they give something back to the initiative in their spare time. A word of advice: take one of their foraging courses before you go picking the mushrooms.Crook Hall, DurhamFirm favourites of Dorothy and William Wordsworth, and John Ruskin – and those guys knew a thing or two about nature – the wild garden of one of the oldest houses in Durham has two hectares of wildflower meadows, an ivy-hung courtyard, a maze, and even a moat. There’s also the Shakespeare Garden, planted entirely with flowers from the Bard’s time. Don’t leave without finding the actual secret garden (no need for a robin to let you in though – it’s all open for you).Kingstanding Beacon, BirminghamWith Spaghetti Junction and The Bull Ring, Birmingham has a reputation for being a sprawling concrete jungle. But nestled between housing estates off an unmarked path is Kingstanding Beacon. Known locally as The Pimple, the second-highest point in Birmingham has a panoramic view of trees, hills and more trees. Just the place for getting up and away from it all.Pure Land Japanese Garden, NottinghamshireIf you thought the closest you’d come to Japan in Nottingham was a maki roll at Yo! Sushi, swing by this soothing meditation garden, complete with Japanese-inspired water features, pagodas, crystals and koi-carp-filled ponds. Created more than 30 years ago by Buddhist monk Maitreya, who still runs personal meditation classes, the garden is the setting for magical events, from Japanese tea ceremonies to lamplit evening concerts.St John’s Gardens, ManchesterFormerly the site of a graveyard, this mini oasis for city workers, visitors and locals boasts an urban orchard of crab apple trees, manicured flowerbeds and Manchester poplars to shade under. There are also plenty of benches for you to recuperate on after you’ve wandered around the Museum of Science and Industry next door.Goldney Gardens, BristolThis ornate 18th-century garden, tucked behind Goldney House in Clifton Wood, is hiding some big secrets behind its ordinary-looking stone walls. And what might those be, you ask? There’s a heritage orchard, an ornamental garden, an orangery, a rotunda and bastion, for starters. Then you can check out the Corinthian columns and explore an elaborate, shell and fossil-lined grotto, complete with lioness and river god – a perfect spot for your very own Jane Austen moment. Tours of Goldney Gardens are run on various dates throughout the summer till 23 August and can be booked online.Bonnington Square Pleasure Garden, LondonOnce part of the 17th-century Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, this plot of land became a bombsite, then a derelict playground dominated by dog poo, before it was imaginatively re-designed in the 1990s by a group of local residents, led by film-maker Evan English. It now features a 9-metre-high Industrial Revolution iron waterwheel, a huge Helping Hand sculpture and lush sub-tropical plants. And zero dog poo.Cambo Gardens, FifeWith winding paths, fast-flowing streams and swarms of butterflies, the walled, wild gardens of Cambo House seem straight out of a storybook. Eclectic in design – think cascades of roses and carpets of more than 300 varieties of snowdrops – the garden has been specially planted to reward the visitor no matter what season it is. Views of the sea at sunset are particularly Instagrammable.Rooftop of the Dolphin Shopping Centre, PooleThis shopping centre in Poole has a bit of a buzz about it recently, thanks to a new sustainable roof garden, complete with two beehives.

(If this is hard to bring to mind, think back to the halcyon days of that website’s Penis Beaker thread and crack open an almost chilled bottle of Wolf Blass.)Think instead of the boost to publishers of impenetrable tomes on international politics written by the big beasts of the literary jungle had the blokes held sway in other words, had Dominic Raab, newly revealed as a voracious consumer of unfettered verbiage, invited his chums round for a bit of a chinwag on their bedtime reading.Those of a delicate disposition may not have been able to stomach the backdrop to Raab’s BBC Breakfast interview from his lovely Thames Ditton home. What right-minded person stores their books like that, in squared-off stacks on their window sills, open to the blaze of the sun and the depredations of squirrels and magpies?But if you could go the distance, it made for interesting viewing. Jonathan Aitken’s foot-breaking life of Richard Nixon Arnold Schwarzenegger’s autobiography Ronald Reagan’s diaries Niall Ferguson’s Virtual History, which imagines our world had critical global events not occurred. No doubt Raab is even now writing a new introduction to Ferguson’s book in which he argues that, whatever alternative scenarios prevail in the future, there will still be bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwiches for tea.It’s unlikely that viewers will have reeled back from their television sets in appalled disappointment that Raab did not reach for a line or two of Emily Dickinson at moments of crisis (“How dreary – to be – Somebody! How public – like a Frog – To tell one’s name – the livelong June – To an admiring Bog!”).Politicians must surely realise by now that they are on a hiding to nothing when they allow us these minor and undefended glimpses into their cultural lives. Essentially, you have to be Barack Obama, who this summer revealed the books that he is most enjoying at the moment, among them Tara Westover’s Educated, in which the author recalls her childhood in a survivalist cult, Michael Ondaatje’s Warlight, Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe and Hisham Matar’s The Return. Pretty classy, even if this week the Evening Standard pulled him up for book bragging and suggested the rest of us avoid it.The only equivalent of note on this side of the Atlantic is Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, who tweets her book recommendations so enthusiastically that she must have zoomed to the top of publicists’ advance copy mailing lists. Last week, she interviewed the novelist Ali Smith at the Edinburgh international book festival and welcomed a group of those who had grown up in care to Bute House to talk about Harry Potter. Reading, she has said, can develop politicians’ empathy.Also in Edinburgh last week was Jeremy Corbyn, whose favourite book is James Joyce’s Ulysses, which, I must concede, endears him to me greatly, even as I wonder what the committed vegetarian made of Leopold Bloom’s lusty enjoyment of the “inner organs of beasts”, in particular “thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods’ roes. Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.” Certainly different fare from the somewhat unadorned courgette omelette the Labour leader cooked up on his allotment recently to assuage the annual glut.Whether Corbyn attended the festival session featuring his former backbench colleague Chris Mullin is unclear though Mullin certainly lost no time in pointing out the continuing relevance of his 1982 novel, A Very British Coup, which, he argued, foretold Corbyn’s rise.I struggle to see Corbyn as Harry Perkins, particularly in the screen incarnation written by Alan Plater and played by Ray McAnally. Thirty years after it first aired, I still remember a climactic moment, in which Kika Markham makes a recording of Robert Tressell’s novel The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists and sends it to Perkins in order to give him the strength to fight in the face of establishment skulduggery. Indeed, it was after watching that – I was 19 – that I borrowed the book from my library and made acquaintance with the inhabitants of Mugsborough and the story of “twelve months in Hell, told by one of the damned”.Back to Raab, and his accounts of great men, told by other men. You have to warm, however grudgingly, to anyone who loses themselves in the details of Arnie’s life. But I might have wished a slightly more wide-ranging list for the secretary of state for exiting the European Union something with a few more laughs and a bit of light and shade. I will therefore beg his indulgence and make a few suggestions:1. The Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann: OK, not a light read and not full of gags, but an interesting insight into what happens when you’re banged up in an institution with a load of Europeans.2. Puckoon by Spike Milligan: side-splitting tale of Irish citizens smuggling goods across the previous hard Irish border in coffins.3. Middlemarch by George Eliot: because no list is complete without\u0026nbspit.4. A Small Town in Germany by John le Carré: 50 years old and still its backdrop of Britain’s traumatised efforts to join the Common Market seem weirdly familiar.5. Expo 58 by Jonathan Coe: a civil servant is packed off to Belgium to protect a fake British pub at an international fair. Predictably, this being Brussels, all does not go according to plan.You’re welcome, Dominic. I’ll be round this week with the single malt and rest of the lads."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c42b2f667c99740be1be8e388f1bcc86c7cb2873/0_89_2752_1651/master/2752.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=730687ba18a1267721a3cd1642f7d204","title":"dont be deluded our saudi partners are masters of repression","story":"The persecution of activists at home and war in Yemen show talk of reform is a charadeFive Saudi activists face possible execution. Their crimes? “Participating in protests”, “chanting slogans hostile to the regime” and “filming protests and publishing on social media”.The five, including women’s rights campaigner Israa al-Ghomgham, come from the Shia-majority Eastern Province. They have spent more than two years in prison. Now the prosecution has demanded their deaths.Their plight reveals the vacuity of claims that Saudi Arabia is “liberalising”. The death in 2015 of King Abdullah and his replacement by Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud has led to much gushing in the west about the new reforming regime and, in particular, about the “vision” of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, heir apparent and driving force behind the “modernisation” moves. The New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wrote a fawning piece about the Saudi “Arab spring”. “It’s been a long, long time,” he wrote, “since any Arab leader wore me out with a fire hose of new ideas about transforming his country.” Even the fierce critic of Islam Ayaan Hirsi Ali has suggested that if the crown prince “succeeds in his modernisation efforts, Saudis will benefit from new opportunities and freedoms”.Yes, Salman has allowed women to drive, to run their own businesses and to attend sports events. Cinemas have opened and rock concerts been staged. But the king remains the absolute ruler of a kingdom that practises torture, beheads dissidents and exports a barbarous foreign policy, including prosecuting one of the most brutal wars of modern times in Yemen.Over the past year, dozens of activists, clerics, journalists and intellectuals have been detained in what the United Nations, an organisation usually wary of criticising the kingdom, has called a “worrying pattern of widespread and systematic arbitrary arrests and detention”. Few countries execute people at a higher rate. Under the current “reforming” regime, at least 154 people were executed in 2016 and 146 in 2017. Many were for political dissent, which the Saudi authorities rebrand as “terrorism”. A regime that permits women to drive but executes them for speaking out of turn is “reforming” only in a columnist’s fantasy.For all the paeans, what really attracts western commentators and leaders to Saudi Arabia is that the regime’s refusal to countenance any dissent has until now created a relatively stable state that is also pro-western. Precisely because the Saudi royal family is deeply reactionary, it has long been seen as a bulwark against “radicalism”, whether that of the Soviet Union, Iran or local democratic movements.Since the Iranian revolution of 1979, there has developed a struggle between Riyadh and Teheran for supremacy in the Muslim world. Both are tyrannical theocratic regimes. Iran’s Islamic reaction is expressed through anti-western sentiment, while that of Saudi Arabia through support for western foreign policies. In the eyes of many western commentators, this makes Iran a fount of evil and Saudi Arabia a force for stability.Last week, in the wake of a Saudi bombing of a school bus in Yemen that left 33 children dead, Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, defended Britain’s relations with Riyadh on the grounds that the two countries were “partners in fighting Islamist extremism” and that the Saudis have helped to stop “bombs going off in the streets of Britain”. In fact, Saudi Arabia bears more responsibility for the rise of Islamist terror than any other nation.From the 1970s onwards, flush with oil money, the Saudis exported across the world Wahhabism, a vicious, austere form of Islam that the Saud clan has used to establish loyalty to its rule after creating Saudi Arabia in 1932. Riyadh has funded myriad madrasas and mosques. It has funded, too, jihadist movements from Afghanistan to Syria. Osama bin Laden was a Saudi. So were most of the 911 bombers. A 2009 internal US government memo described Saudi Arabia as “the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide”. The Saudis have leveraged their knowledge of such groups to win influence with the west.The viciousness of the Saudi regime is matched only by the cynicism of western leaders. The price is being paid by the children in that school bus and by the five activists facing possible beheading for peaceful protests by the million of Yemenis on the verge of starvation and by thousands of Saudis imprisoned, flogged and executed for wanting basic rights. But what’s all that when set against the value of a “friendly” regime?Le Mont St Michel, off the coast of Normandy, is glorious. It’s not just the setting – a rocky outcrop far enough away from the mainland to wrap it an aura of mystery, close enough to be able to walk to it like a modern-day pilgrim.It is also the marvel of the abbey at the top. Dating back originally to the eighth century, it was constructed and reconstructed over almost a millennium, yet appears almost seamlessly unified in its lines. The church is a magnificent blend of sombre romanesque and luminous gothic. The delicate, light-filled cloisters seem suspended between sea and sky.When I visited the abbey last week, I found that it had also been turned into a kind of theme park. There is only one route through it for tourists, beginning with the crypt. The moment you enter, you’re greeted with purple lighting and organ music seemingly borrowed from Hammer House of Horror. You almost expect to see Christopher Lee leaping out of the shadows. And as it begins, so it goes on – starlight projected on to the stairwell, muzak blaring from the church.It’s as if the abbey’s administrators imagine that no visitor could be interested in the beauty and grace of the architecture, or in the deep and fascinating history, but needs to be coaxed with the ecclesiastical equivalent of Disney World. The effect is disconcerting, robbing the abbey of any sense of peace and contemplation. It’s also in keeping with our times.The abbey was constructed during centuries when religion was not only essential to people’s lives, but imposed upon them in insufferable ways. Yet it also inspired magnificence in art and architecture and wonder at the majesty of those creations.That religion in the west has been sapped of much of its power is welcome. That it has been replaced in part by a culture that Disneyfies wonder is something to lament."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19d007928d59859e148d21dd60a1004159cd51e1/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fbad237854f2ca00b950dd53e1a319f","title":"the ultimate guide to autumn tv film music theatre politics sport","story":"A musical Twelfth Night, Michelle Obama’s memoirs and the last ever gig by Ennio Morricone: our critics preview the new season• Jay Rayner on the best of autumn food• Morwenna Ferrier on five key seasonal fashion trends• Andrew Rawnsley on what to expect from politics Bodyguard (BBC One, 9pm) has autumn’s new TV off to a roaring start. Jed Mercurio’s new series about an autocratic home secretary (Keeley Hawes) and the man charged with protecting her (Richard Madden), is a twisty political thriller and arguably the most nail-biting new series of the year.It’s not the only politically tinged drama on the BBC this autumn. Hugo Blick’s much-awaited Black Earth Rising starring John Goodman and Michaela Coel arrives on BBC Two next month followed by Korean director Park Chan-wook’s certain-to-be-visceral take on John le Carré’s classic The Little Drummer Girl (BBC One). Meanwhile, Mike Bartlett’s Press offers a different kind of tension as two rival newspapers do battle in the age of internet news (BBC One, September).Over on ITV, September sees Regency-era intrigue with a star-laden Vanity Fair and twisty thrills in Strangers, starring John Simm. A topical tale of a transgender child follows in October with Tony Marchant’s sensitive Butterfly starring Anna Friel. Channel 4 aims boldly for infinity and beyond as Sean Penn leads the cast of mission-to-Mars drama The First in October, David Simon’s The Deuce returns to Sky Atlantic on 26 September and lovers of the supernatural can either swoon to Sky One’s sweeping take on Deborah Harkness’s romantic fantasy A Discovery of Witches (September) or shudder to Netflix’s dark reimagining The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina in time for Halloween.Autumn’s most eagerly awaited new comedy is Desiree Akhavan’s tale of life and love in London, The Bisexual (Channel 4, October). Elsewhere, the gang from Kurupt FM make the jump to BBC Two for the final series of mockumentary sitcom People Just Do Nothing (late 2018), the ever-inventive The Good Place returns to Netflix (September) and Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith get spooky with a live Halloween edition of Inside No 9.The centenary of the first world war armistice brings with it a host of programming including Peter Jackson’s They Shall Not Grow Old in conjunction with the Imperial War Museum (BBC One, November) while fans of The Crown should check out Princess Margaret, a new two-part documentary on BBC Two.Finally, autumn wouldn’t be autumn without reality juggernauts Great British Bake Off (Channel 4, starting on Tuesday) and Strictly Come Dancing (BBC One, September), while national treasure David Attenborough returns with Dynasty, a five-part series about power, family and territory that promises to be just as tense as anything fiction can provide (BBC One).After a five-year hiatus, I’m giddily awaiting the return of British director Steve McQueen. Widows (Nov) is inspired by a TV series that was on ITV in the early 1980s. Co-written with Gone Girl author Gillian Flynn, it’s a mobster movie with Viola Davis leading a pack of women out for revenge (“No one thinks we have the balls to pull this off,” she says, ballsily). I’m happy to see McQueen making a contemporary film after 12 Years a Slave’s period setting and am on the lookout for his signature geometric framing and installation-like sequences. Luca Guadagnino’s reinterpretation of Dario Argento’s 1977 cult giallo-inflected supernatural horror Suspiria (premiering at Venice film festival, Sept) reunites Dakota Johnson and Tilda Swinton, both of whom starred in his breezily enjoyable A Bigger Splash. Following the sun-soaked romance of Call Me By Your Name, the Italian film-maker’s light touch seems a weird fit for such dark material, so I’m intrigued to see what he brings to the project.The fourth iteration of A Star Is Born (Oct) since the Dorothy Parker-penned original in 1937 sees Lady Gaga as a country singer on the rise and, after being tossed around development hell, is directed by the actor Bradley Cooper. It looks like delicious Oscar bait. Black Panther’s Ryan Coogler and Michael B Jordan are today’s Scorsese and De Niro Rocky descendant Creed II (Nov) is their fourth collaboration and if the slick adrenaline rush of the first film is anything to go by, worth getting excited about. Elsewhere, Chloé Zhao’s The Rider (Sept) sits outside of the Hollywood horse race, but it’s a remarkable film about a young bronc rider (real life rodeo-er Brady Jandreau) struggling to retain his identity after an accident relegates him from champion to trainer. Watching Jandreau with the horses feels both like cinéma vérité, and a breathtaking ballet of non-verbal communication. Sebastian Faulks is among a host of big hitters with novels published this autumn. His superb Paris Echo (6 September) weaves winningly between the present and the second world war, between Tangiers and Paris. Sarah Moss’s Ghost Wall (20 September) is stunningly good, a tightly written, powerful book about archaeology and Englishness. Sarah Perry follows up The Essex Serpent with her gothic Melmoth (4 October) – it’s creepy and compelling. Finally, Propolis is a new indie publisher making exquisite books. The Ballad of Syd and Morgan by Hayden Middleton (26 October) brilliantly imagines a meeting between Syd Barrett and EM Forster.In nonfiction, there’s In My Mind’s Eye (6 September), a “thought diary” by the always-fascinating Jan Morris. Former record exec Will Ashon has come up with something really special in Chamber Music, the riotous history of the rap group Wu-Tang Clan (1 November). Julian Baggini’s How the World Thinks (4 October) is there to fill the Sapiens-size hole in your life, while Becoming, the autobiography of Michelle Obama (13 November), is sure to be as warm and wonderful as the woman herself. For something quite different, try The Ravenmaster by Christopher Skaife (4 October), a gloriously eccentric and terribly British memoir of life with the famous birds of the Tower of London.Not many of the arts have originators still producing captivating new work. Chair of the pantheon Paul McCartney releases his 17th solo studio album on 7 September and plays a handful of shows in the run-up to Christmas. Egypt Station filches its name from a painting of McCartney’s from 1988. Helpmeets include producers Greg Kurstin and Ryan Tedder.One of McCartney’s favourite new artists, Héloïse Letissier makes her bid for the big leagues next month. Chris, the second Christine and the Queens album, due 21 September, finds Letissier embracing her inner tomboy. “Sweaty” and “cinematic” are the buzzwords UK dates follow in November.Singer Matt Healy recently revealed that he checked himself into rehab in Barbados before beginning work on the 1975’s third album, A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships. The Cheshire outfit’s eagerly awaited opus is still without an official release date, but widely hoped to be landing in November. Apparently, there’s another one already waiting in the wings.Another band who fetishise 80s guitar sounds, Philadelphians the War on Drugs, bring their lush, Grammy-winning A Deeper Understanding album to London’s O2 Arena in December, their biggest date yet. Finally, wielding the baton over one last time is 89-year-old composer Ennio Morricone, who plays his last-ever UK gig on 26 November.Two returning podcasts to be excited about are Where Should We Begin? with Esther Perel (Audible) and Radiotopia’s Ear Hustle. Series three of Perel’s relationship therapy podcast is framed around the evolution of marriage and follows six couples at different stages each episode is a real, unscripted consultation between psychotherapist Perel and a couple with problems. Her acute insight and verve, plus the undeniable fascination of other people’s problems, make this unmissable.Ear Hustle, which brings intimate inmate stories about life inside US prisons, is always a revealing, surprising listen series three starts in September.And the BBC will give us Intrigue: The Ratline. Told by barrister Philippe Sands, whose grandfather’s family were murdered in a Polish extermination camp, this podcast is a “sort of mystery story” about Otto Wächter, a Nazi we’ve barely heard of, because he was never brought to justice. The Ratline was a Nazi escape line out of Europe and this promises to be a gripping tale.Bristol Old Vic boldly brings to the stage Touching the Void, mountaineer Joe Simpson’s memoir of being trapped in a crevasse in the Peruvian Andes. Tom Morris directs David Greig’s adaptation designer Ti Green is tasked with making the mountains Josh Williams plays Joe (18 Sept-6 Oct, then touring).At the National, Sophie Okonedo and Ralph Fiennes are likely to generate Shakespearean sizzle in Antony and Cleopatra (18 Sept-19 Jan). Simon Godwin’s production, which includes the marvellous rising star Fisayo Akinade, is designed by the mighty Hildegard Bechtler. Another magnetic pairing is set to ignite The Height of the Storm. In the latest drama from the intriguing Florian (The Father) Zeller, the peerless Eileen Atkins and Jonathan Pryce play a couple who are beginning to ask questions about their 50-year-old marriage. Jonathan Kent directs Christopher Hampton’s translation, which can be seen at Richmond, Bath, Cambridge and in London at Wyndham’s (from 1 Sept in Richmond).Musical transformations are in the air. Marianne Elliott’s production of Stephen Sondheim’s Company, whose songs include The Ladies Who Lunch, for the first time casts a woman as the lead character Sondheim is happy with the change. Rosalie Craig stars as Bobbie alongside Patti Lupone and Mel Giedroyc at the Gielgud in London (10 Oct-22 Dec).Meanwhile, Kwame Kwei-Armah opens his first season as artistic director of the vital Young Vic with a musical version of Twelfth Night (2 Oct-17 Nov). The lyrics and score –jazz, soul and R\u0026ampB – are by Shaina Taub. The designer is Robert Jones. Kwame Kwei-Armah directs with Oskar Eustis from New York’s Public Theater.1 Lorenzo LottoPortraits, National Gallery, London (5 Nov-10 Feb)The National Gallery is publicising this show with a superb portrait of Andrea Odoni, painted in 1527. The face could be modern – the complicated expression detains the viewer. Lotto was one of the great Italian Renaissance portraitists with a gift for psychological penetration and this, the first exhibition of its kind in the UK, looks unmissable.2 New photography centre at V\u0026ampA(Opens 12 October)The V\u0026ampA has one of the largest photography collections in the world and this thrilling, new, state-of-the art space (twice the size of the existing gallery) will launch with a gloriously compendious exhibition, ning the history of photography, from daguerreotype to digital.3 Gainsborough’s Family Album, National Portrait Gallery, London (22 Nov-3 Feb)Gainsborough and the TheatreHolburne Museum, Bath (5 Oct-20 Jan)The NPG show will give us what promises to be a rare, intimate insight into Gainsborough as 18th-century family man while the Holburne Museum will show portraits of erse thespians by “the most faithful disciple of Nature that ever painted” as a companion piece.4 Fernand Léger: New Times, New PleasuresTate Liverpool (23‑Nov‑12 March)This is the first exhibition of Fernand Léger (1881–1955) in 30 years. Léger was a questing, versatile, metropolitan artist and this illuminating show will include paintings, textiles, experiments with typography and a chance to see his intriguing experimental 1924 film, Ballet mécanique.5 Yayoi KusamaVictoria Miro, London (3 Oct–21 Dec)The uncompromisingly psychedelic Japanese artist, beloved by Instagrammers, is going strong and startling at 89 (a Dogwoof documentary celebrating the “queen of polka dots” will be released alongside the retrospective).Dundee is the place to be in September, where the craggy inverted pyramids of Kengo Kuma’s Victoria \u0026amp Albert Museum will be opened to the public. After that, it will be Devon, where long-awaited Secular Retreat, by the revered Swiss architect Peter Zumthor, will open at a date still to be specified. Here, there is more rough-hewn masonry, although for a smaller audience – it is part of Alain de Botton’s Living Architecture series, which can be rented for weekends and holidays. December will see the opening of the first phase of the Elizabeth Line (formerly known as Crossrail) and with it a series of new stations by Foster and Partners, Wilkinson Eyre and other notable architects.The Royal Academy’s exhibition on the Shard architect, Renzo Piano, opens on 15 September. So does the London Design festival, whose blend of creativity and commerce will include a “maze-like” plywood construction by the architects Waugh Thistleton at the London V\u0026ampA. On 10 October, the RIBA will announce the winner of this year’s Stirling prize whichever project wins will have to win over those critics who have called the shortlist a “beige tide”. The choice runs from Foster’s palatial headquarters for Bloomberg to a community centre and nursery by MUMA, in the North-West Cambridge Development.1 Dylan Moran: Dr CosmosThere are few weary, caustic takes on life more appealing than Dylan Moran’s. In his Dr Cosmos tour (3 Sept-8 Dec starting at Norwich Playhouse), he proves himself more than capable of living up to his sizable reputation.2 Comedy at Soho theatre, LondonThis is the place each autumn to catch the hottest fringe shows as they tumble down from Edinburgh. Two examples are Bleed, the latest solo show by self-styled “riskiest comic in the business” Jordan Brookes (25 Oct-10 Nov), and the searingly personal Sunrise by Jessie Cave (12 Nov-1 Dec). Also on offer is a monthly appearance of Dan Renton Skinner’s creation Angelos Epithemiou, best known for his stint on Shooting Stars and still a big draw on the circuit (1 Sept, 3 Oct, 5 Nov).3 League of Gentlemen Live Again! A most welcome artistic reunion, the League of Gentlemen are on tour until 29 September – a rare chance to see them weave their devilish magic on stage.5 Kidding (Sky Atlantic)Over on TV, and returning from the wilderness somewhat, Jim Carrey is Mr Jeff Pickles, a beloved children’s TV presenter trying to cope after his world is lifted up and unceremoniously dumped on the ground.

Now it will be performed in the London museum’s Jerwood Gallery, not far from its Darwin centre, where many of the original specimens brought back by the naturalist are on display.The gallery is being transformed into a 357-seat theatre in which, from 2 October until the end of the year, seven actors and 30 handmade puppets, including a huge Galapagos tortoise, will entertain audiences eight times a week.Professor Adrian Lester, a palaeobiologist at the museum, has advised Morton on the script, alongside the dramatist Sebastian Born. “The idea for the show came from work we were doing in South Africa with the Handspring Puppet Company,” said Morton. “We wanted to tell the story of the young man, Darwin, who went out on this incredible voyage, rather than of the older man with the grey beard we are all more familiar with. It was an extraordinary adventure for a 22-year-old to spend five years of his life on these travels. The show is about him wrestling with the issues raised by his discoveries.”Three shows a week will be staged during the day for the patrons of the museum, which attracts 4.5 million visitors a year. Five further evening shows will start at 6.30pm after the main museum doors have shut.“The piece is aimed at adults, so we advertise it for those aged 10 and over, but although it is quite long, it is not a lecture,” said Morton. “Lots of children will enjoy it too, even if some of the content goes over their heads.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba32cb09ecea789275bd6f8c42e9b544e86962be/0_91_2594_1556/master/2594.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c704e6308bfaebd245252dc32fb612e","title":"action demanded mayors save uk inner city poor from air pollution","story":"City leaders across England and Wales have teamed up to demand that Theresa May take immediate action to fight air pollution, which scientists say causes at least 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK.A total of 17 mayors and civic leaders, representing 20 million people throughout the country, have signed a letter that calls for a national action plan to clean up the nation’s air to be implemented as a matter of urgency. They include the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, as well as mayors Andy Burnham (Greater Manchester), Steve Rotheram (Liverpool city region), and Dan Jarvis (Sheffield), along with leaders from authorities around the country including Cardiff, Leeds, Newcastle and Southampton.“Our country’s polluted air is shortening lives, damaging our children’s lungs, and severely impacting on the NHS as well as costing the economy in working days lost,” they say. “Crucially, these consequences ... disproportionately affect the poorest and most vulnerable.”The group is demanding that the government:• Pass a stringent clean air act that will give local authorities powers to regulate emissions such as those produced by taxis and private hire services in cities.• Set up a targeted vehicle renewal scheme to replace older, more polluting cars, buses and lorries, but in a way that will protect local businesses.• Provide funds to support the establishment of clean air zones and provide investment in cleaner buses, taxis and other forms of transport.The letter, also sent to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the environment secretary, Michael Gove, was written in the wake of the national clean air summit in June when many civic leaders met to debate the air pollution crisis. The event was jointly hosted by the mayor of London, the UK100 cities network and the Institute for Public Policy Research.“Our most deprived communities, who already have to cope with multiple health problems, suffer most from the effects of polluted air,” said Rotheram. “In Liverpool we have areas where men have a life expectancy seven years lower than the national average. There is only so much that we can do as an inidual area, which is why we need a national plan for clean air.”This view was backed by Bristol’s mayor, Marvin Rees. “It is unacceptable that lives are at risk,” he said. “We need the government to show leadership with a way to support low-income, vulnerable families and small businesses who rely on diesel vehicles to be able to shift to cleaner cars.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e740212f336d4e14eca2594bc2730ddd7c430e2/541_128_4453_2671/master/4453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0185181c24567fc6b66f730d790ee00","title":"la vie en rose nows the time to rethink pink in pictures","story":"Pink just grew up.

One of the most intriguing extends from the town of Vittoria in the southeast of the island, home of the frappato variety, used to make pleasantly light, strawberry-and-cherry-scented red easy-drinkers such as Beccaria Frappato 2015 (£7.75, WoodWinters). For a truly ethereal expression of frappato – one that brings sage, rosemary and spice to the perfumed strawberries – try Arianna Occhipinti Frappato 2016 (£33.05, Les Caves), while the same winemaker’s white blend is a summer garden swirl of jasmine, with blood-orange pith, tang and refreshment.Nicosia Fondo Filara Etna Rosso, Sicily, 2016 (£12.50, The Wine Society)Frappato also features in a rather lovely selection of Sicilian wines put together by The Wine Society (the case is shared with wines from Italy’s other great wine island, Sardinia, worth a column of its own). But as attractive as the peppery strawberry juiciness of Nicosia Frappato di Sicilia 2017 (£9.95) is, I preferred the same producer’s productions from the island’s most dramatic winemaking location: the slopes of Mount Etna. Nicosia Fondo Filara Etna Bianco 2016 is beautifully perfumed but is lifted out of the ordinary by the scintillating, riesling-like nervy acidity it gets from the local carricante grape. The Nicosia Etna Rosso, meanwhile, has Etna’s trademark red-wine mix of pinot noir-like slippery elegance with minerals and a syrah-like spice-and-fruit combination. At £12.50 a bottle, both are outstanding value.Follow David on Twitter @Daveydaibach This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The manager insisted the 29-year‑old was suffering with catarrh. “This information isn’t true.

Eight years ago, when he entered the World Cup on the back of a 16-month scoring drought for his country, he assured reporters that once the seal was broken, the goals would readily flow.It did not really happen for him in South Africa, Ronaldo chipping in once before Portugal went out in the last 16. Since then, though, he has scarcely stopped scoring. The giant Nike billboard raised in Turin’s Piazza Veneto in recent days reminds us of his greatest hits – from becoming the fastest player ever to score 350 times for a top-tier European club, through to his status as the most prolific player in European Cup history.The wait goes on, though, for his first goal as a Juventus player. A\u0026nbspsellout crowd had packed in to the Allianz Stadium for his home debut on Saturday expecting to see precisely that. Each time he put the ball in the net during the warmup, they roared as though it were the real thing.This was a peculiar occasion: an ostensibly tricky fixture against a Lazio side that had won here last season, yet with an atmosphere that felt more akin to a friendly. A whole city had been counting down to this moment ever since the day of the World Cup final – when Ronaldo snuck into town to complete a move that even the most optimistic fans had not thought possible.His presence has already become all-consuming for some. Leading into Saturday’s game, the Turin-based sports newspaper Tuttosport had led its front page with Ronaldo’s face for seven consecutive days.When this game finally began, though, an unexpected quiet took hold. Was there a hint of nervousness or were we just being reminded that Turin is not Naples or Rome? The tone of this city has always been more reserved than other parts of the peninsula. Juventus’s manager, Massimiliano Allegri, likes to say that moving here transformed him into a “slipper-wearer”.It was not a cheer but instead a round of whistles that cut through the silence, as Leonardo Bonucci put his foot on the ball: the centre-back’s return to Juventus one year after he deserted them to join Milan has not gone down well with ultras on the Curva Sud. The rest of the stadium was quick to counter with a polite round of applause.Allegri had sprung his first minor tactical surprise of this season, abandoning the 4-2-3-1 he deployed for the season opener against Chievo in order to move Ronaldo out to the left of attack in a 4-3-3. Hardly a dramatic shift – Juventus had finished with a similar shape in Verona – but nevertheless an acknowledgement that the Portuguese had not integrated seamlessly into existing schemes.The manager had spoken eloquently about the need for patience before this game, reminding us that “football is a game of connections”, which could only be built through time together on the pitch. Even so, it was hard to escape the sense that Juventus were trying too hard to force the play in Ronaldo’s direction.After an uneventful first quarter of\u0026nbspan\u0026nbsphour, the Portuguese moved\u0026nbspinto the centre, swapping places with Mario Mandzukic in a move that would be repeated several\u0026nbsptimes throughout the course\u0026nbspof the game. From\u0026nbsphere, Ronaldo sowed a little more unease\u0026nbspin the Lazio defence, at one\u0026nbsppoint forcing a poor back pass and charging down Thomas Strakosha’s attempt to clear. But the ball bounced harmlessly to safety.Perhaps his urgency set something off in his teammates as well. Moments later, Federico Bernardeschi retrieved a ball that everyone else seemed to have given up on as it ran out towards the right touchline. The Italian whipped an inviting inswinger towards the middle of the six-yard box, but Ronaldo could not make a decisive touch with his head.Minutes later it was Miralem Pjanic who opened the scoring with a beautifully taken first-time effort from outside the box. Ronaldo strolled over to congratulate him, yet the celebrations still felt muted. Lazio were very much in the game, carving out opportunities of their own, but somehow the threat of an equaliser still felt secondary to the crowd’s need to see their new No\u0026nbsp7 put his name on the scoresheet.A rising crescendo came down from the stands as Ronaldo hitched his shorts up at the thigh in the customary fashion for a free-kick just after the hour mark, only to be replaced with a groan as his shot flew straight into\u0026nbspthe wall. He went closer with a turn and dipping strike from the edge of the box but Strakosha pawed it over the bar.If these were half-chances, then something far more presentable would arrive in the 75th minute. João Cancelo, another summer addition, surged down the right and played a low ball across the area. Ronaldo was arriving right on cue but Strakosha erted the ball a fraction behind him. Instead of passing into an empty net, the forward succeeded only in clipping\u0026nbspthe ball with his right boot\u0026nbspon to his\u0026nbspown left heel.It was left to Mandzukic to sweep home, sealing a 2-0 win. Ronaldo’s first season with Juventus has begun\u0026nbspwith a perfect six points from\u0026nbsptwo games. A sense of frustration still lingers, though, as that ketchup refuses to flow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f7b5ff232bb3d9cdb54c26cd423887ca6f78b42/0_133_2708_1625/master/2708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5c0d5f3d45ae114bf5db51104e2831d","title":"liverpool brighton premier league match report","story":"Liverpool have made the start to the season they wanted even if they have yet to hit the giddy heights of the latter part of the last campaign.Jürgen Klopp named an unchanged side for the third time in three matches and watched his players collect a third win, moving to the top of the Premier League in the process. Klopp has been there before, though it was almost two years ago and only a brief visit. In each of his three previous seasons in England the German has had to witness teams either running away with the league (Manchester City and Chelsea) or proving uncatchable (Leicester City). This time Liverpool are understandably keen to be the ones staying a step ahead, and though there is a long way to go they are setting the pace, with some room left for improvement.Pep Guardiola has just claimed his Manchester City side are below maximum efficiency after a World Cup summer, and the same appears to be true of Liverpool, who put several passes astray and made too many poor decisions in the final third for their manager to be completely happy. Or perhaps they simply found an organised Brighton side difficult to break down. There was never much doubt about the result once the home side had taken a first-half lead, but Brighton were by no means overwhelmed and will kick themselves over the lapse of concentration that ended up costing them the game.“We gave away a very poor goal but I was proud of the way we played after that,” Chris Hughton said. “We put ourselves in a great position to get something, in fact I’m a little disappointed that we didn’t.”Liverpool could have gone in front as early as the fifth minute after Sadio Mané played Mohamed Salah into space behind Gaëtan Bong and moved into the penalty area to accept the return pass, only to sidefoot narrowly wide of goal. Brighton set themselves up to contain, Hughton revealing special measures were necessary against a team of Liverpool’s firepower, but quickly discovered that the problem with five men across midfield and only Glenn Murray as a token outlet was that it made it hard to break out of their own half. Liverpool just kept swarming forward and it took a good one-handed stop from Mat Ryan to keep out a Roberto Firmino header from Andy Robertson’s cross.For all that the home side had a let-off when Alisson came out of his area to deal with a ball from Yves Bissouma and failed to make any contact. Solly March was left in possession near the corner flag with the goalkeeper stranded but he miscontrolled to let the ball run harmlessly dead. Trent Alexander-Arnold hit the bar with a free-kick after Naby Keïta was fouled on the edge of the area before, almost inevitably, Salah struck midway through the first half.The visitors will not enjoy the inquest at the training ground. From a Brighton free-kick in their own half a mixture of careless passing and Liverpool’s determined press left Bissouma caught in possession by James Milner. Mané lost no time in transferring the ball to Firmino, whose precise pass in turn allowed Salah the space to find Ryan’s bottom corner with a confident left-foot finish.Brighton opened the second half with a chance to equalise when Anthony Knockaert shot wide. Liverpool’s inability to put the game out of reach encouraged their visitors to get forward, without producing much in the way of end-product. Liverpool’s best chance of a second goal came through their two full-backs. When Robertson thoughtfully turned the ball back Alexander-Arnold saw his effort deflected past a post.It is probably just as well Liverpool can take solace from the league table, for they might have been embarrassed late on when Alisson had to make virtually his only save of the game to keep out Pascal Gross’s header.“We had a good mindset in the first half but we didn’t show the same patience in the second,” Klopp said. “I wouldn’t say we were under pressure but Brighton had their moments. Alisson had to make a big save at the end but there is no need to be negative about nine points from three games.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a106f6a9d929064e54b8c8d8a8e5e6ef4faad49/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31ebb0d58760d8c70513a2af95b1d435","title":"mourinho vs the world and a book writers special football weekly extra","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Jonathan Wilson and Michael Calvin to discuss Liverpool’s perfect start, José Mourinho’s issues with everyone, books, plane banner protests and the joy of chancing across a game in the parkRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Here, she talks about her love of acting, industry bullies and why spoilt luvvies need to get over themselvesAnna Maxwell Martin walks into the room, in the heatwave, sits down in a stripy blue dress that crumples all around her, and says she’s going to do this photoshoot in the nude. “Tits out, full frontal – this is it guys,” she says. “First time, this is it. Oh look,” she adds, brightening, as someone brings over a whirring fan, “I can have this for my sexy lady photoshoot, too.”She’s joking, of course, because she’s not that sort of famous. But then, what sort of famous is she? She’s an actor whose name you might not know, but whose face you surely do, from many period dramas (she won the best actress Bafta for Bleak House in 2006) and, most recently, the starring role in the edgy, hysterical BBC2 comedy Motherland, in which she plays a reluctant mother who is always trying to get in with the comically awful parents of her children’s peers. The cult show has slipped into the vernacular: “It’s pure Motherland,” a certain kind of middle-class parent will now mutter as another micro-drama unfolds at the school gates. In casting, Sharon Horgan, the show’s writer, hoped for an actor “who made you laugh but also made you panic inside,” she says. “And Anna does that. She’s one of those actors who’s so naturally gifted she can just switch it on and off. She’s also a little bit nuts, which always helps.”There will be a second and third series of Motherland, but Maxwell Martin doesn’t know when and is breezy about dates – as she seems to be about parenting itself, having grown up near Hull and not been too exposed to the precious yummy-mummy ideals of north London, where she now lives, and which the show lampoons. Rather like her character, she isn’t too bothered about the minutiae of education. She has two young daughters herself. “My nine-year-old didn’t do Sats because she’s dyslexic,” she says, “so they were really sweet about it, but she still seems to be tested all the time, which makes her feel shit – she’s nine! Dyslexic kids are often the loveliest kids – she’s adorable. As long as kids can make eye contact, chat, sit round a table and have a meal with adults – I don’t care about anything else. She says she wants to be a potter and travel around in a VW van with other artists and I say fine. You’re fine.”I mention my own daughter, something that came up in her school report. “She’s six, darling!” she says, in a Yorkshire accent that seems to get stronger the longer we talk. “Who gives a shit? She shouldn’t even be at school!”We are soon in much more serious territory, discussing a forthcoming BBC factual drama called Mother’s Day in which Anna plays Wendy Parry, the Englishwoman whose 12-year-old son was killed by the IRA in the Warrington bomb of 1993. (Do not confuse Motherland with Mother’s Day – they could not be more distinct.) I tell her that I was sent a link to watch a press preview online and, wrapped in a towel at 7am, only clicked on it to check that it worked. I was still sitting there in my towel 90 minutes later when it ended. It got me. She nods, as if this is to be expected.“I haven’t felt this proud of a piece of work for… a long time,” she says, explaining that she can’t bear those TV dramas where we see so much “gratuitous snotting. In a different person’s hands they would have ramped up the whole Colin and Wendy thing, the husband and wife disagreeing about speaking to the press – that would’ve been a big row.” But because the director, Fergus O’Brien, comes from a 20-year background in making documentaries, “it means he doesn’t want to invent some big emotional drama. He says, ‘Just work with what you’ve got.’ And actually, it’s really positive in the end.”There is such a lean economy to the drama that there is only one scene where we see her character overcome with emotion, falling on to a bed. “And that’s it. And I tried to cover my face so you didn’t see any of that.” I suddenly realise why that scene was so compelling: because it wasn’t entirely given to us. Such minimalism is perhaps not the way to the Oscars, but then does Maxwell Martin have those goals? She did try LA for a bit. “I went over, I didn’t really like it. I nearly got a really big movie – a Coen brothers film.” She says she believes in her work, “and I really have a lot of confidence in myself as an actor, but I don’t necessarily have that same confidence in a room full of people, networking at a party. If someone said, ‘Hey, do you want to come down to this really cool party?’ I would probably have said, ‘No, I have cystitis, sorry.’” A wry smile is never far from Maxwell Martin’s face.“Then I got into a family situation very, very early. But again I just – maybe I don’t have enough ambition.” She is married to Roger Michell, who directed Notting Hill, and who had two children before they met. They now have two more children together. I start to say something about her fame and she interrupts me. “I don’t have fame – I’m not famous. I get, ‘Have I met you at playgroup?’ The other day I got,” she puts on a hoiked-bosom home counties accent, ‘Did I play mixed doubles with you at Binningdon tennis courts?’ And I went… ‘No.’ Because I can’t say,” she starts to stage whisper, “‘I’m actually an aac-tresss,’” and then cracks up laughing.Does anybody ever say “Are you Anna Maxwell Martin?”“No! Never. So no, I’m not famous and maybe that’s a good thing. The rule for me is, I will only work on something if a confirmed fun friend is already signed up to it. Who is the Confirmed Fun Friend? OK, I’ll do it.” She laughs. “I’m such a connoisseur, I so believe in the arts,” she says sarcastically, self-mockingly. “Why not? I’m really lucky to do a relatively easy job. I’m not a moaner, and so if I’m going to work, I have to have a good time.” But she quickly changes her tune when she remembers how fascinating she found Boy George on Who Do You Think You Are? “I’m so desperate to be famous enough to go on that programme. I’m literally desperate.” She becomes visibly excited, “I’m Inuit, and they’ve never had an Inuit on that.”Maxwell Martin grew up in Beverley, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and went to the local high school. Her mother was a research scientist and her father ran a pharmaceutical company. She started acting when she was a very young kid. “My parents were like, ‘Huh, who are you?’” But this was smalltown Yorkshire and there was no chance of getting on the telly. “I’d never even heard of youth theatre until I came down here. I would have loved to do that, never knew about it. I did go to a drama teacher in Beverley but really we did singing. We’d sing Whitney Houston songs dressed in crop tops. That was it.”She used to get the bus into York with her friend Sal and eat a fat rascal at Bettys, do a bit of shopping, go home. Sal was boaty and wore pearls, “but I was a bit more Slaggy Bev,” she says. They used to sneak into nightclubs, somewhat unaware of how dangerous Hull was at the time, “but often I wouldn’t get in because I looked so young. We all had fake ID but my friends would laugh at me.”That baby face came in handy, though, when she was 25 and played 12-year-old Lyra in His Dark Materials at the National Theatre – her big break. We discuss the joy of ageing (she’s 41), how there’s no point in lying about it.“How hot is Jennifer Lopez? And she’s 49. And so I think she should be going round saying she’s 49,” she says.Yeah but we don’t look like Jennifer Lopez.“Do we not?” she asks. “For the record,” she adds, leaning over and speaking right into my Dictaphone, “I do.”Before attending Lamda in London, Maxwell Martin went to Liverpool University to study history, where she made the group of female friends she has maintained for life, to add to her school friends, and with whom she cried when Geri left the Spice Girls, “but I can’t remember any of my degree. I really was just there to act and make friends and drink Bacardi Breezers. I think I did a lot on the First and Second World Wars, but Roger likes to quiz me about the dates at dinner parties because he knows I don’t know anything. He likes to show me up in a group situation… where I flounder,” she says drolly.As for the current industry upheavals, I ask if she expected to live through the #MeToo movement in her lifetime. There is the longest silence. Then she says quietly, “I think I was really ignorant of what was happening. I have always been a really strong, forthright woman and never considered myself any less than a man, and that’s not out of arrogance. I think that’s just because I was brought up by two nice parents. So I just hadn’t experienced that. Or even if I was sort of lewdly commented on, I have a really good sense of humour and so I can always bat it back. Or even if I was touched up, I could just bat it back. So I didn’t really register the extent of the problem.”She stresses that she is very glad the conversation is now open, “but I just want that slightly moany element taken out, where women are throwing into the pot all stories about sexual indecency and violent rape. Violent rape is very different from having your tits touched. It’s very, very different, and we don’t serve those women with any sense of justice if we lump all these things in together.”About eight years ago she discovered pay inequality, while doing jobs “where I’d be number one on the call sheet and a man would be number three, but he would be on twice my wage. But even when I then raised it with my agent at the time, that was a no-no. Unequal pay seemed like a complete brick wall.” But again, she wasn’t born a luvvie and she can’t bear whining. “When you’re talking about being paid millions of dollars, you cannot moan about it. So let’s move it really quickly into women in all industries who are on zero-hours contracts, women who are exploited all the time in low-wage jobs – because I think we sound slightly like twats in our industry. We have a very charmed life, we get picked up in the morning, driven to work, someone brings us a cup of tea, ‘Where’s this?’, ‘Where’s that?’, ‘The air con’s not working’ – actors can behave very badly and become infantilised very quickly. I am in the loveliest job, I’m paid very well, and then I go home with a driver – I mean really,” she says. That last “really” is said in a tone that expresses full disapproval of the actors making 10 times more than her and complaining 10 times as loudly.She isn’t even sure about pinning all the problems on men. “I’ve been bullied by other women in the industry – in fact more so than I have by men. Undermined, made to feel stupid, when there’s very clear favouritism in the room from a man. Most of the men I’ve worked with are good people who are totally respectful and lovely. There have been a handful who are bastards but also a handful of women who are bastards, too.” She actually calls them the C-word but says not to print it because her mother will be appalled, just like she was when Anna rang her the other day to read out a poem she had written for her friend’s 40th birthday, in which she called her friend an old C. “I like it,” replied her mother, “but I do not like that word.”She has been filming the period drama David Copperfield, directed by Armando Iannucci, in the heatwave “and we’ve been wearing the full corset, then the layers of skirts, one of which is an actual duvet, outside, and it’s 100 degrees. You last five minutes then you rip it off – but oh my God it’s got a brilliant cast. Tilda Swinton’s in it, Dev Patel. He’s brilliant. Ben Whishaw. Daisy May Cooper – oh God I love her, she is just great. Hugh Laurie.” I ask about the resounding popularity of period dramas and she says it is because they are comforting. “Anyone who has acted in a period drama will tell you that it’s the one thing you get people rushing up to you in the street to talk about, even a decade later. People love them – and we haven’t had a cracking one for ages.” This one will be different, though. “Armando has done his thing on it so it’s pretty out there, funny, different. He’s made it ageless and colour-blind – I hate that term, but it works. When you see Dev Patel playing David Copperfield he really is David Copperfield. He has a charm and an innocence about him and I think it’ll be a game-changer. In some ways, after doing Armando’s, I look back on those ones, the all-whitey ones, and I’m a bit like, ‘God, shit, that looks a bit embarrassing now.’ The ones I was in or the other ones, with all-white casts – that looks a bit dumb now. Because it just really didn’t have to be like that.”She is playing a character in the film who’s a man in the book, Mr Strong, “but I’m playing him as Mrs Strong”.So it’s not gender-blind either? You’re not playing a man?“No – I would have loved to have done that. I could have dressed as a man. I would have loved that,” she replies.Why – because it confounds gender expectations and frees you up to enter this whole other realm of acting that has been hitherto unavailable to you?“No! Because I wouldn’t have had to wear the duvet.”Mother’s Day will air in early September on BBC2"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58f197158ad0e862f94e38927b093db8f5ce27eb/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd55b356f0e59d9a82273ef06ef845bc","title":"celebrity mothers breast pump boom kourtney kardashian pink","story":"Scarlett Johansson did it en route to the Oscars, Chrissy Teigen took one on a “date night” and Kourtney Kardashian did so after a night out in Vegas. In a bid to highlight the realities of breastfeeding, celebrity mothers are sharing their breast pump photos online, and experts claim they are helping to fuel a rise in women expressing milk.As mothers attempt to reconcile the pressures of work with the often relentless demands of breastfeeding and childcare, they are trying in growing numbers to pump milk. Last week, Goldman Sachs became perhaps the first firm in the UK to pay for breastmilk to be couriered home if female staff are away on business.Alison Spiro, an adviser for the Institute of Health Visiting, said more mothers were attempting to pump milk in a bid to spread childcare more equitably.“We are seeing dads much more involved in childcare, and manufacturers have focused advertising on the fact that fathers can feed their babies breastmilk.”Anna Burbidge, from breastfeeding support group La Leche League GB, said her organisation had noticed an increase in mothers talking about expressing.“The increase in assisted conception, along with mothers giving birth prematurely, having multiple births and becoming mothers later in life, can sometimes lead to challenges with lactation,” she said.Another major explanation for the rise is work commitments. “For many who are in employment, this is the only way they can combine breastfeeding with their jobs,” said Caroline Gatrell, lecturer in work and family at the University of Liverpool, who pointed out that it is not always a straightforward option.“It involves collecting milk into sterilised containers, which is time-consuming and may be noisy, and it must be refrigerated and taken home in a cool bag. It can also be difficult at work because mothers must pump at regular intervals.”Cost can also be a deterrent. “The equipment is very expensive. It’s over £100 to buy an electric pump,” said Spiro. According to Katherine Twamley from the department of social sciences at University College London, an increasing number of parents opt to pump because they want to share the feeding process with their partner, but cuts to local breastfeeding support services means that people lack the correct advice. “My research shows there are increased aspirations to share feeding via pumping, but most are unable to successfully manage this. Like breastfeeding, mixed feeding needs peer or family support,” she said.For some women, pumping enables them to prolong breastfeeding, involve others in the feeding process and enjoy the odd night out. “It gives me freedom to work and not be the only one feeding my son,” said Sarah Wallace, who has a 10-month-old.Others, however, say they were left with no choice but to express if they wanted to give their baby breast milk. Dance instructor Beccie Savage, 43, was advised at hospital to express for her son as he was underweight and had trouble feeding. He ended up preferring the bottle and rejecting the breast so she exclusively pumped for six months. Although it enabled her to go back to work part-time six weeks after the birth, she said it was not as easy as the celebrity selfies suggest.“It’s really hard having to sterilise all the time, and doing it every two to three hours is painful,” she said. “I don’t regret it but there wasn’t enough support for me at the beginning.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

We’re peering into what was once the outdoor privy of a Victorian fisherman’s pub. “It’s a bit of a DIY job, but it works.” Bagner was born in Stockholm and has transposed the Swedish bathing ritual – an ice-cold dip followed by a stint in the sauna – to Kingsdown on the coast of Kent. “We do it all year round. People think we’re mad, but it’s starting to catch on.”Alex and her husband, Chris, bought the Victory as a holiday home eight years ago. Chris’s great-grandfather owned the local Walmer brewery, and his mother grew up here, so they had a connection to the area and the Victory, once owned by the brewery. The pub served its last pint in the 1950s, but for many years it sat next door to the Zetland Arms, which is still open. “In that pure Kent way, I guess they thought, the more the merrier,” says Bagner.The house is at the end of a private road that runs parallel to Kingsdown beach. A footpath spiked with blackberry bushes and wild fennel separates the row of fisherman’s cottages, bungalows and grand Edwardian houses from the shingle beach. In front, a line of unassuming beach huts faces the English Channel. “When we first started coming here it really was quite different,” Bagner recalls. “The Zetland Arms was deserted. On winter days, it felt like the end of the earth here. That was before High Speed 1 and Airbnb changed things quite dramatically.”The couple, who now have three children, lived with the house for four years, “fiddling around until it was really falling apart”. They figured out how they wanted to use it before renovation work began. “We’re both into entertaining and hosting – not in a big showy way, but our house is always quite full. That’s how we’ve always lived.” The cottage now sleeps 11, in four bedrooms. (There’s a double bunk bed on the ground floor, two doubles on the first floor and a family room in the attic.) Wood panelling, narrow passageways and white floorboards mean it still retains “that cottagey sense”.On the ground floor they extended out into what was the pub garden, creating a generous kitchendining room that faces the beach. What was the kitchen is now a snug TV room with a huge log burner for warming up damp beachgoers. Above the kitchen, connected to the main bedroom, is an aluminium-framed sunroom furnished with mismatched chairs and sofas. A battered midcentury leather sofa and Ercol day bed are strewn with sun-faded cushions and a pair of cocktail chairs recovered in Sanderson fabric faces the sea. “The sun comes up right here, so this is where we sit with coffee and the papers,” says Bagner. “The rug is normally covered with Lego and furniture from the doll’s house.”From the sunroom, Bagner points out the boat her eight-year-old son has just bought. Last summer he raised £200 by setting up a little shop on the footpath selling painted stones, homemade ice cream and lemonade to passers-by. “I’m not sure it’ll ever be seaworthy, but he takes himself off there to read,” says Bagner. “He wants to rename it Mayhem, but I’ve heard it’s bad luck to change the name.”Upstairs, the hallway was reconfigured to accommodate an extra staircase leading to the converted attic. A double bed fits snugly into the new dormer, which overlooks protected woodland, the end of Kingsdown beach and beyond to the white cliffs of Dover. On the other side of the bannister, a partition wall separates the double bed from the two singles opposite: an idea suggested by a friend, Nicola Harding, of the interior design practice Harding and Read.Harding also advised on the colour palette for the cottage, suggesting Farrow \u0026amp Ball’s Setting Plaster for the panelled hallway, Blue Ground for the pocket doors and stairway woodwork and Oval Room Blue for the master bedroom. “This was when choosing different colours for every room was still quite a new thing,” says Bagner. “At the time, I remember thinking, ‘Really? Not just white?’” But she held her nerve and the result is a lively interior that feels very personal despite the house being occupied year-round by mini-breakers.It’s a handsome, three-storey building revived with rich colours, glowing velvets and locally sourced vintage furniture. “It’s eclectic and fun and full of things we like,” says Bagner. Happily, it’s a combination others are drawn to. Hen parties, young families, locals and “DFLs” (Down From Londoners) fill the bar and restaurant – “in that pure Kent way”.

He said he had no romantic feelings for me, which of course I accepted. Fast forward to now. I recently wrote to him asking for some help with my PhD idea. We messaged each other over it for about an hour and a half. Nothing wrong with that – but I noticed a few hours later that half the messages we exchanged were deleted by him. The content was flirty. He has a girlfriend but it’s complicated. What I don’t get is why did he delete the messages? It’s not unusual for us to be flirty. What’s going on?Mariella replies  Do you really need me to tell you? I’ve realised after two decades in the job (yes, yes, slow learner I know!) that often people write to me so I can spell out clearly what they already suspect but aren’t ready to accept. You certainly back up my theory, as the first part of your letter pretty succinctly sums up what’s causing the problems outlined in the latter half of it.It’s fair enough for me to be cast as the baddie, sitting here, emotionally removed, making my pronouncements on the lives of others. But perhaps that’s exactly why, two decades later, people are still writing. Advice from a stranger comes with an absence of judgment that’s hard to access from a close friend and hopefully makes the unpalatable element of self-realisation that bit less of a personal attack. If you don’t like what I have to say, you can conclude that I’ve misinterpreted you, or failed to understand the nuances of your situation because I don’t know you. I’m sure on occasion that’s a fair assumption, but on a good day what you’ll get back from this column is confirmation that what you suspect is the reality.The closer you are to someone, the harder it is not to use your privileged knowledge of them to offer wisdom based on the person you judge your friend to be. Our interpretation of relationships, like history, depends a lot on who is recounting the story. Laying your emotional life bare to a total stranger has to have some advantages. I don’t know you, I can’t use past history against you or form a prognosis based on it and so, in the best of cases, have an unimpeded picture of what’s being ulged.I answer only what I’m asked by my correspondents and on occasion that causes ire. I understand such misgivings but I also feel that mine is a privileged and advantageous vantage point. Ironically it’s far easier to find a clear path in complicated emotional territory from a stranger than during a night of wine-fuelled confessions with a close friend. Friends are a great sounding board but most of us turn in times of need to the one we hope will tell us what we want to hear.When you write to me you have no such luxury, but there is the possibility that the process of setting down your dilemma and having it evaluated on that basis will offer confirmation of what you already know, deep in your heart. Friends and family can be compromised by their knowledge of us and although past mistakes can provide great learning opportunities, at other times they merely muddy the water.You probably won’t like me for what I’m about to say but I’m sure you’ll come to see that there was no other way to read your dilemma. You and this male friend have been admirably honest with each other, which is to both your credit, even if on your part your admission was by mistake. It’s terrifying to own up to having feelings for someone we already know, braving the possibility that the relationship may be damaged beyond repair. He certainly didn’t string you along, which can be judged as either a chivalric or cowardly choice, depending on how forgiving your nature.Your mate has been crystal clear and I hope you expressed appreciation to him for honouring you with his honesty. Now, time has passed and yet you seem to be wishing it had stood still. When the possibility of a romance has been broached and rejected, the time for flirty emails also passes.You say this man’s relationship with his girlfriend is complicated, offering that as an excuse for why a flirtation isn’t unreasonable, but it won’t be improved by your emotionally convoluted interchanges. I imagine he’s deleted your conversations because they allude to a form of relationship he doesn’t want with you and doesn’t want to have to justify to her. Either way the signal he’s sending loud and clear is that yours is a platonic friendship and he is otherwise preoccupied.I know that’s hard to accept and the very nature of love is to inspire hope and optimism in the unrequited lover. We both know that you are lingering when you should have moved on and this man, if he’s to remain your friend, needs to stop being reminded that you wished otherwise. Advice on your PhD is a perfectly good reason to be in touch but not if you’re still scrutinising every word from him for potential weakening of his desire to keep things platonic. Let’s be frank with each other: if you can’t accept what he is offering then you should be seeking advice, academic and otherwise, from other quarters. Thanks for writing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48f1bd1bc4b552a4338cc0cce09f2e3d53f6dc2e/0_228_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40e48d7d96c7e2b2e90d802939bdf01a","title":"unlike on screen dads i can hold a baby the real horror is in my head","story":"Feckless film dads are neither accurate nor interesting. The reality of fatherhood is seeing every new toy as a life-threatening weaponOne of the big surprises about having a baby is how amazing I am at it, compared to the world’s most famous men. Like so many others, a fair bulk of my expectations about fatherhood came from screen portrayals of feckless dads. These posit that babies are near impossible for men to supervise for more than 45 seconds at a time, difficult to even hold without them squirming and spraying like a startled squid. You will know this if you have watched a cinematic depiction of a man changing or feeding a baby for the first time, during which you’d be forgiven for thinking it was also the first time he had ever used his own hands.You can see the montage in your head already. Tom Selleck grimaces as he opens a nappy. Seth Rogen squints in horror at the instructions for a crib and Michael Gambon ends up showered in turds while wearing a nappy on his head. All of this repeats until Arnold Schwarzenegger collapses, weeping, in a heap of talcum powder, plastic wrapping and not-yet-dried baby piss.Later, Channing Tatum’s wife returns home to find that beautiful lunk she married, passed out in the cartoonish pile of plastic bottles he’s crushed with his big, muscular arse. Her husband, Zac Efron, still holds his phone on a snoring chest, its last Google search - ‘What is a baby?’ – dimly illuminating the gentle dark. What’s important, she thinks, is that her darling Charles Laughton has done his best: he’s looked after a child for half an afternoon, and both have survived.In reality, changing and bottle feeding are neither remotely difficult nor particularly unpleasant, just repetitive and, over time, a bit boring. Depicting this stuff as uniquely and inherently difficult for men bears the implication that we are stupid and, more insidious still, that parenting really should be left to women. Neither is accurate, or more importantly, interesting.It’s not like the horrors of fatherhood are difficult to find. I cringed through the boy’s first days, dementing myself over every ill that could befall him. All the cutesy things we bought have now taken on the appearance of spinning, skin-piercing choke hazards. This is because every object on Earth is now a spinning, skin-piercing choke hazard.Buttons might as well be Stanley knives, and keys shrapnel from a hand grenade. A cousin bought a stuffed rabbit so luxuriantly soft it’s almost a gas, and I spent 20 minutes imagining its small, hard nose bursting his perfect little eye. This pattern kept repeating me receiving a harmless item manufactured specifically for children, and reacting like I’d been posted a nail bomb dusted with Sars.I want to see Ryan Gosling, wracked with thoughts about his sleeping daughter swallowing her entire blanket and pillow set. Or Paul Rudd, unable to step within five metres of a window because he imagined his son being snatched from outside by a passing, stilt-wearing thief. Until then, screen dads will have to settle for being clueless dolts a hapless cohort of idiots being literally, and figuratively, shat on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47a0082deec05d5044877a3c6c056df7670a04d4/0_0_1960_1180/master/1960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab1d5c18036e12c668799fa9229ccbaf","title":"greece in 10 audiobooks a listeners literary guide","story":"Myths, magic and mandolins feature in these stories about one of Europe’s oldest and grandest culturesIf you’re planning a summer vacation to Greece, the good news is it’s hard to get it wrong. From the stunning coastlines of Crete, to the lively festivals of Thessaloniki and the sacred sites of Delphi, the country combines beautiful landscapes with rich mythology and literature. Go on a sunset wine tour beside the bright-blue seas and domes of Santorini, believed to have been the home of the mythical land of Atlantis. Or visit Delos, where Apollo, the god of poetry, truth and prophecy, is said to have been born. Travel to one of the world’s largest natural harbours in Ithaca and you’ll see why Odysseus is intent on returning here in Homer’s Odyssey. Literature is inescapable in Greece. Athens offers its own tour of the spots where writers from all over the world once spent their time keen cyclists can take a three-hour bike tour around historic Athens and Plaka. Families with teens can be led around the city by a street-art expert, exploring the graffiti and urban art of a thriving creative scene. And if it’s great food you’re after, why limit yourself to eating when you can learn how to make it too? Join one of the city’s cooking lessons designed to give tourists a chance to recreate seven traditional Greek dishes, before heading home with a recipe book.If you’re in the market for a lazy holiday of sun, sand and sea, Crete could be the place for you. With its secluded bays and pink-sand beaches, Greece’s largest island is stunning and hospitable. Elounda is perhaps the fanciest part – a good spot if you’ve got a bit of cash to spend, or for the honeymooners. Alternatively, you could take the heart-stopping drive through narrow roads on steep cliffs to Stefanou Beach, an incredible cove of turquoise water. Elafonisi Beach is the place for pastel-pink sand. It is near a national park where tourists are known to come and do a five-hour hike through the gorge. Nature lovers might also enjoy Pátmos, designated as the “Holy Island” of Greece. Its settlement, Chorá, is a world heritage site, where white houses sparkle under the Aegean sun between historical streets leading from the island’s port, Skála, to the famous monastery. This is where John the Apostle wrote the Book of Revelation, having been banished to Pátmos by the Roman authorities. Ultimately, Greece’s extraordinary literary legacy is evident almost everywhere you look. Whether you’re exploring the inner cities or taking time out on the beach, a holiday in Greece is a great chance to familiarise yourself with the abundance of literature written about this ancient, mythical and beautiful country. And you might want to start with any number of the audiobooks listed below, perfect for listeners heading there this summer.The Magus by John Fowles, NaxosNicholas Urfe is a young Brit teaching English on a fictional Greek island, based on Spetses. Bored and consumed by his loneliness, he stumbles on to a wealthy estate and its Greek owner, Maurice Conchis, a man who may have collaborated with the Nazis. The two develop a friendship, and Nicholas is drawn into Conchis’s mysterious ways and psychological games, becoming a performer in re-enactments of the Nazi occupation and obscene parodies of Greek mythology. This is a chilling thriller, as well as a postmodern classic, in which the narrator, Nicholas, grows unsure of what is real. Many of its settings exist, however. The Lord Byron School, where Nicholas teaches, is the Anargyrios and Korgialenios School of Spetses, and Villa Bourani is a private house on the south side of the island, overlooking a popular public beach.The Names by Don DeLillo, MacmillanDeLillo knows how to write a dense and elusive novel. And he doesn’t miss the mark in this tale about the mythological world. The characters are bizarre, yet well realised, and the author uses their story to look at family loss and language. It’s classic DeLillo, in so far as all the players are smart and eloquent, including the children, and it is stylish throughout – much more than just your average exotic thriller. Set in Athens, this is a story that moves away from conventional plot to focus on politics, culture, religion and mythology.Murder in Mykonos by Jeffrey Siger, HachetteWhen a backpacker goes missing on the island of Mykonos, no one is sure if it is her body that is found in the ancient church. Andreas Kaldis, the new chief of police, recently arrived from Athens, is faced with an island of locals who are used to doing things their own way. The case reminds him, and veteran homicide investigator Tassos Stamatos, of the ritualistic murders of a few years ago, but the suspect has since killed himself. So who could the killer be? The book reveals its author’s intimate knowledge of Mykonos, with very visual descriptions and lots of information about the historic churches. Perhaps it’s no surprise this was a bestseller in Greece.Exit West by Mohsin Hamid, PenguinIn the newest novel by the author of The Reluctant Fundamentalist and How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia, Hamid tells a story about migration, in which the refugee journey happens through a portal. While living in an unnamed country taken over by war, Nadia and Saeed hear of “doors that could take you elsewhere, often to places far away”. The couple pass through a portal and find that they are on the Greek island of Mykonos, in a refugee camp. Here, “everyone was foreign, and so, in a sense, no one was”. Exit West is a timely tale about the global refugee crisis, much of which Greece has witnessed first hand. This modern history of the country is just as compelling as its mythology.Captain Corelli’s Mandolin by Louis de Bernières, AudibleSet on the Greek island of Kefalonia, the novel follows Antonio Corelli, an Italian army captain who comes to the island in the early days of the second world war. Corelli begins a love affair with Pelagia, the daughter of local doctor Iannis. Their relationship is complicated, as is to be expected in wartime, and atrocities mount around them, in both their personal lives and the life of the island itself. This is a love story and a war story – a tale of an island that is occupied first by the Italians, then the Germans. The characters are gloriously rendered and Captain Corelli’s Mandolin uses its magical setting to tell a now-famous story about romance and courage.Shirley Valentine by Willy Russell, Laughing StockYou’ve probably seen the film, adapted from the play of the same name. Shirley is a lonely middle-aged Liverpudlian woman in a loveless marriage. When her friend offers to take her on holiday to Greece, she packs her bags and heads for the sun. The gorgeous island of Mykonos is a strong attraction for both tourists and, seemingly, many of the writers who go there. And it’s the same for Shirley, who rediscovers herself here, along with the happiness she’s been longing for. Hers is a story of finding self-confidence, and recognising it’s never too late to start again.Zorba the Greek by Nikos Kazantzakis, Recorded BooksMaybe you’ve seen the film too? Written by Cretan Kazantzakis, the novel tells the story of a Greek intellectual who befriends working man Alexis Zorba. Zorba is a larger than life and unpredictable, unlike the narrator, who is modest and reserved. The two become friends, and the passion in Zorba’s character reminds both narrator and reader of the joys of living. Set in Crete, the tale captures the island’s passionate spirit – full of its smells, tastes and wines.The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller, IsisThis is The Iliad skilfully told from another perspective. Writing from the point of view of Achilles’s best friend, Patroclus, Madeline Miller convincingly reimagines the relationship as a romance, casting a different light on the Trojan War. Achilles is given a human touch. He is gentle and capable of love. It’s a new side to an ancient story and it’s super smart. The men are not positioned as brothers in arms, but as the soul mates that Homer hints they might be. Greece’s wealth of mythological and classical literature is complemented by this masterful modern interpretation.My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell, AudibleThis autobiographical work tells the story of British zookeeper, conservationist and TV presenter Gerald Durrell’s childhood on the Greek island of Corfu, where he discovered his interest in the natural world. Home-schooled during this period, Durrell became friends with a Greek doctor, Theodore Stephanides, who acted as a mentor to the boy and kindled his fascination with local fauna. The book is as much about the author’s family experiences as it is about Corfu. “It was originally intended to be a mildly nostalgic account of the natural history of the island,” wrote Durrell, “but I made a grave mistake by introducing my family into the book in the first few pages.” My Family and Other Animals is as charming as it is full of sunny olive groves and cypress trees, and all the more enjoyable for it.Mythos by Stephen Fry, PenguinAncient Greek literature has inspired creators from Shakespeare to Walt Disney. The Greek myths are told to you here by the ever-soothing voice of Stephen Fry, who takes you from Zeus to Athena with his typical humour. The Greek gods of the past become relatable, as pop culture, modern literature and music are woven into their stories. It is joyfully informal, yet full of the literary legacy threaded through so much of the tapestry of contemporary Greece.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible – £7.99 a month after 30 days.

The call came as the Daily Record published what it claimed were details of one of two complaints against the former first minister being investigated by the Scottish government.Salmond strongly denies the allegations and has launched legal action against the government over the investigation. The claims about his conduct toward two staff members in 2013, while he was in office, have been handed to Police Scotland.The Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said Sturgeon should suspend Salmond from the SNP immediately. “Not to do so will send the wrong message to members in her party and the people of Scotland,” she said. “People who experience harassment should be able to come forward in the knowledge there is a safe environment to do so and that the workplace they are in treats their complaint robustly.“The SNP must do all it can to give complainants the support they need whoever the alleged perpetrator is, and make clear that there is safe space for any other survivors to come forward. The first minister has been too slow to act on these shocking allegations. Nicola Sturgeon must take action and she must do it now.”The Scottish Conservative MSP Annie Wells said: “We must respect the women who complained and allow due and fair process to continue so that the facts can be brought out. However, these revelations do raise questions about the way this matter was treated when it is alleged to have taken place, and these also need to be answered. We need to see full transparency from the SNP and the Scottish government.”A fresh statement from Salmond issued on Saturday said: “As Mr Salmond made very clear yesterday when he spoke to all media outlets, he intends to make no further comment on these matters until his petition for judicial review is heard in the court of session.“This is done on legal advice and in the context that he refutes these complaints of impropriety and absolutely denies any suggestion of criminality.”Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary of the Scottish government, said the two complaints were raised in January and that Salmond was notified in March about an investigation. She had intended to make a statement regarding the complaints this week, but the move was halted after the former first minister initiated legal proceedings.Sturgeon said she had first heard about the investigation from Salmond in April and had played no role in the complaints process.A Scottish government spokeswoman said: “For legal reasons, the Scottish government cannot comment on the nature of the complaints.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/138b0f447f5973d65cf91dc724406f0c3197159d/0_2_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01d7f54656749698bbb5d95275f4e095","title":"end battery hen existence in summer holidays childrens commissioner","story":"Urgent action is needed to stop children leading a “battery hen existence” during the summer holidays that is damaging their mental health, contributing to violence and ensuring they return to school in worse health than when they left, the children’s commissioner for England has\u0026nbspwarned.In an interview with the Observer, Anne Longfield said radical measures were needed to restore the importance of play, such as overhauling play areas and parks, and encouraging GPs to recommend “play on prescription”.She pointed to evidence showing that cardiovascular health and obesity levels deteriorate over the summer break as children stay indoors on computers and phones.Longfield called for the funds raised by the government’s “sugar tax” to be used to ensure attractive play schemes were located in the right areas and gave children and parents a safe, exciting and affordable facility.“We all remember how important the long school holidays were,” said Longfield. “But there is a sense that children are retreating into their homes or being limited to their homes, and we are seeing the consequences in terms of health, mental health and marginalisation from school and violence.“Parents told me in the playground that if they hadn’t been there, the children would have been in the house in what was described to me as a ‘battery hen existence’ for so many kids – spending vast amounts of time during a hot summer online.“A very straightforward, doable and increasingly evidenced way of tackling a whole range of these issues would be to have a major programme of investment in children’s play activities outside school and during school holidays.”A study published last year by UKactive, a not-for-profit group of organisations that campaigns for better health, found that children were measurably less fit by the end of the summer holidays. The deterioration was considerably worse among children from deprived areas.Research has also indicated that half of British seven-year-olds do not meet the chief medical officer’s minimum physical activity guidelines of at least 60 minutes activity every day.Longfield, who will publish a report on the importance of play this week, said she had visited local schemes working with GPs. She suggested the “play on prescription” model could be widely adopted, once a proper network of play schemes had been established.Proceeds from the sugar tax, expected to hit £240m this year, have been earmarked for school breakfast clubs and sports. However, Longfield said the money should also be used to boost play outside school time.She said she had visited adventure playgrounds that were already having a major impact. “If you could place some of these playgrounds in areas where there is real disadvantage, real poverty, concerns about violence, you are almost enabling children to reclaim that open space and benefit from all the free-range aspects of life that we all want them to have.”Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, the former Paralympian and chair of UKactive, said: “We have built a world which suppresses our children’s natural instinct to be active, replacing it with sedentary lifestyles and screen addiction. The holidays should be spent playing with friends but for many children it has become an unhealthy, unstimulating and even lonely time – damaging their physical and mental wellbeing.“We must make physical activity and play a public health priority for all children and young people, with practical solutions to make activities more accessible and appealing.”Sarah Wollaston, the Tory chair of the health select committee, backed the calls. “Physical activity and play are enormously important to children’s physical and mental health,” she said. “Providing these facilities may save money down the line. It is fantastic value in avoiding the costs later on of poor mental and physical health.”A government spokesperson said: “We are fully committed to ensuring that young people and their families have clear opportunities for physical activity and are determined to halve childhood obesity by 2030.“Our world-leading childhood obesity plan will help children to exercise more and reduce their exposure to sugary and fatty foods, backed up by £40m from Sport England to encourage children and families from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to get active.“We’re also investing £300m to work with schools and colleges to help promote, protect and improve children and young people’s mental health and wellbeing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87119a1845ea192be2e5ebbee339ff22808dc0e1/0_43_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dc4880176a30844d543fc5f05bf17f9","title":"long school summer holidays inequality poorer families","story":"For well over a century, schoolchildren have greeted the dawning of the summer break with joy. Many aspects of the Victorian school system – blackboards and easels, caning and capital punishment – have fallen by the wayside. But the long summer holiday, originally adopted in order to allow children to help with the harvest, has remained a fixture of the education system long after child labour was outlawed in the UK.The Observer is the world\u0027s oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791. It is published by  News \u0026amp Media and is editorially independent.It’s tempting to romanticise the extended break as a precious time out from the pressure of tests, a chance for children to enjoy spending time with their friends and learn important life skills outside the classroom. But as the holidays draw to a close, a report from the children’s commissioner for England warns of important shifts in the way children spend their summer holidays.In this age of screens and social media, children are spending less time playing outside and more online, with many leading a “battery hen existence”. On average, children from five to 15 years old spend almost three hours a day online at the weekend, but just four hours a week playing outside – half the time that their parents did. There are inevitable consequences: research suggests children experience “dramatic and significant” reductions in their fitness over the summer break.Unsurprisingly, it is children from poorer backgrounds whose fitness suffers the most. Low-income parents face a greater struggle to make ends meet during the long school holiday than in term time: half say they stay in more often during the school holidays than in term time because of the expense of taking children out for summer activities. As safety concerns mean parents are less likely than ever to let their children play outside unsupervised, it is the children of more affluent parents who are most likely to stay active, thanks to expensive camps and sports courses.The children’s commissioner makes a number of sensible recommendations, including providing more funding for subsidised summer holiday clubs and meals for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. The government should also consider increasing benefits for low-income parents over the summer break.But another, complementary measure should also be on the table. There’s an established body of research from both the US and the UK that shows children forget some of what they have learned over the long summer break – the “summer slide” – and that this learning loss is, again, biggest for children from poorer backgrounds. In other words, the long summer break comes with an inequality double whammy: it increases the social gap not just in terms of physical health and fitness, but in educational attainment, too.Shortening the summer break to four weeks could help reduce these effects. One method would be to restructure the existing school year into five eight-week terms – two before Christmas, three after – each separated with a two-week holiday. This would give teachers and children a similar amount of holiday, just spaced more evenly over the year. And it would make life easier for all parents who struggle to find childcare for six weeks on the trot. Currently, school term dates are set at the discretion of councils and academy trusts. Some councils, such as the Isle of Wight and Nottinghamshire, will be experimenting with a shorter break next summer. Were the government to roll out a shorter break nationally, it would prompt sighs of relief from many working parents. The long summer break is a relic that disadvantages poorer children and makes life difficult for modern working families. Its time is long past."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e94c57ae9dc6da466e15ee0820139a48b9e111ad/0_51_4803_2883/master/4803.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=757cb0d225eb02c651d2ab6691cd1f7a","title":"owen farrell backs dylan hartley england captaincy","story":"• Fly-half says Hartley did an ‘unbelievable job’ before injury• Hooker has not played for England since the Six NationsOwen Farrell has given Dylan Hartley a ringing endorsement to resume the England captaincy after the Saracens fly-half assumed the role on the summer tour of South Africa.Eddie Jones gave no guarantees Hartley would return to the role when including the hooker in his August pre-season training camp and does not intend to confirm his captain until England convene to prepare for the November matches against South Africa, New Zealand, Japan and Australia.Hartley has not played a competitive match since the Six Nations after a long lay-off owing to concussion but did make his comeback off the bench in a Northampton pre-season fixture on Friday. The 32-year-old has captained England in 26 of Jones’s 31 Tests in charge, leading the side to 23 victories, but his international future was questioned during his extended spell on the sidelines.Farrell led England in the June series defeat by the Springboks and is widely tipped to succeed Hartley eventually in the role permanently but he has welcomed the return of the hooker. “Dylan is a brilliant captain,” he said. “Dylan has done an unbelievable job over the last three years.

Twelve months after his team time-trial success on last year’s opening day the BMC Racing rider demonstrated his inidual prowess against the clock in Málaga to beat Team Sky’s Michal Kwiatkowski by six seconds.As the sun dipped on a warm August afternoon and flocks of British tourists made the most of their Bank Holiday weekend, 176 riders careered one by one round an eight-kilometre course in the city’s historic heart. While a modest climb and small cobbled section were not enough to separate the general classification contenders greatly, the atmospheric finish along the pedestrianised Calle Marqués de Larios ensured a fun opening to the Vuelta’s 73rd running.In recent years the race has been the most tightly contested of the three Grand Tours. Over the past decade the average time gap on the Vuelta podium has been just above two minutes – almost half that of the Tour de France. With this history in mind there was little complacency as each member of the peloton rolled out on the Málaga waterfront. “The Vuelta used to be a lot more relaxed,” Mitchelton-Scott’s sports director, Matt White, jokingly complained before the stage. “There’s no relaxed racing any more, anywhere.”Team Sky’s Dylan van Baarle was the best of the early riders, with the Dutch time-trial champion enjoying a lengthy stint in the hot seat. He was dethroned by Movistar’s Nelson Oliveira before Kwiatkowski surged into the lead with a commanding ride. But the Pole’s time was not enough to hold off the fast-finishing Dennis, the fourth-last rider of the day.“I was confident but when I saw Kwiatkowski’s time I became a little nervous,” admitted the Australian, who in 2015 beat the Tour de France time-trial speed record. “In the end you can only do what you can do – I just put everything out there and hoped for the win.” Dennis’s victory means he is the first non-European rider to win inidual time-trial stages at all three Grand Tours.BMC Racing will be hoping Dennis’s success bodes well for the weeks ahead. The team’s leader, Richie Porte, was considered among the main contenders in Spain after crashing out of the Tour de France but a bout of gastroenteritis on the eve of the race disrupted his preparations.Porte finished 51 seconds down on the winning time. “It was terrible,” he said with characteristic bluntness. “I’ve felt absolutely shocking – it’s been hard to be motivated for it. But it’s nice to start the race.” If Porte fails to recover an already wide-open Vuelta field will become even more unpredictable.But Dennis was upbeat about his teammate’s prospects: “He is not too bad – he’s in good spirits. Today wasn’t suited to him as it was. We will see him get better and better as the Vuelta goes on.”With the Sky pair Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas opting to ride the Tour of Britain, which begins next Sunday, British hopes in Spain rest primarily with Simon and Adam Yates. Although neither brother is a renowned time-trialler both gave a good account. By finishing only 29 seconds down Simon Yates gained a slender advantage over Porte and several rivals. The Colombian climber Nairo Quintana was a second slower than Yates while the 2010 Vuelta winner, Vincenzo Nibali, finished 11 seconds behind the Briton.The Vuelta continues on Sunday in the foothills of southern Spain, with a 163km ride from Marbella to Caminito Del Rey. Stage two will begin with a minute’s silence for Javier Otxoa, a former Spanish professional rider who twice won gold at the Paralympics after recovering from a training accident that left his twin brother, Ricardo, dead. Otxoa, remembered for beating Lance Armstrong on an epic Tour de France mountain stage in 2000, died during the week after a lengthy illness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a6b247bd3841a9446a70e98534da38bd233e910/0_97_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7d336a2ae78c94633487ba66f1db596","title":"lindsay kemp a life in pictures","story":"The experimental British choreographer and mime, who collaborated with stars such as David Bowie and Kate Bush, has died in Italy at the age of 80"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/beb3adbc66d4790df35c3fd39d207e5ad9f7fe73/0_111_2300_1380/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cde25b067ef8beefaf8746b887a32542","title":"stalemate for logan paul and ksi in hyped youtube boxing match","story":"The boxing match between YouTubers KSI and Logan Paul was set to be, at least according to the hype, “the biggest event in internet history”. But in the end, it may have all been the prequel to another event, as the main fight ended in a draw in front of 20,000 people at the Manchester Arena. Online, the fight was watched by millions, both on the official pay-per-view YouTube channel, and on bootleg livestreams on other platforms.Neither of the men are professional boxers, having earned their fame for the videos they post on YouTube. KSI, real name Olajide William “JJ” Olatunji, has more than 19 million subscribers. He initially shot to internet fame with videos of him playing Fifa videogames. Logan Paul was one of the breakout stars from Vine, a now defunct social media app on which users posted humorous six-second videos.Each comes with his share of controversies. In January, 23-year-old Paul posted a video showing the body of an apparent suicide victim, while KSI, 25, was accused of making sexist comments in his earlier videos. Both apologised in the aftermath of each case. Appropriately enough, the boxing event too was contentious. The British Boxing Board of Control put out a statement ahead of the match distancing itself from the event: “Neither inidual is licensed by the BBBBofC and the BBBofC does not participate in such events.”Among the fans who made it to the arena were 22-year-olds Luke Robinson and Laura Busby, both from Scunthorpe. “I’ve never been to a boxing match before, but we’re massive KSI fans, so we thought we’d come,” said Busby. “It’s a really big deal for KSI,” said Robinson. “It’s not just a boxing match – it’s personal.”The encounter in the ring seemed to be important to Paul too. Referring to the uproar over the incident in January, he thanked KSI and said: “You saved my career.”The match had all the trappings of a professional boxing event, from the dramatic walkouts to the trash talk. Renowned ring announcer Michael Buffer even announced the main card with his trademark: “Let’s get ready to rrrrrumble!”This is the second time two YouTubers have fought in a white-collar match, in a phenomenon that aims to monetise online feuds between internet celebrities. Over the last few months, KSI and Paul have been curating the drama of their feud through social media. Adding to the soap opera, their brothers, Jake and Deji, also fought on the undercard, with Jae emerging victorious. But after six evenly fought rounds, the judges scored a draw – meaning the drama will be extended to a rematch already scheduled for February. Interviewed after the fight, KSI said: “Let’s do that again, that was fun. Holy shit.” Paul, too, seemed to have enjoyed the experience: “I think it’s what the people want. Let’s give them a motherfucking rematch! … I feel like I won that fight, but it doesn’t matter. What happened happened. The rematch is going to be fucking crazy.”It’s unclear exactly how much money the participants will make, but between livestreams, ticket sales, merchandise and the promise of a repeat next year, it’s likely to be a small fortune."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4528f5f7ecd3c5598e37ffe957a6dedaacce5296/41_562_4878_2927/master/4878.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b10a9e08f0ac32de305bdce13ea221b6","title":"arrival of pope francis in ireland brings mixed emotions","story":"Leo Varadkar’s speech during papal visit focuses on church’s failings over child sexual abuseThe Irish prime minister has called for a new relationship between church and state in which religion is no longer at the centre of society, as the pope made his first visit to Ireland this weekend.In a blistering speech focusing on the failings of the church, delivered in the presence of Pope Francis, Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach, said a new covenant for the 21st century was needed that reflected the modern country Ireland had become and learned from “our shared mistakes”.Pope Francis, who is on a two-day visit to Ireland, repeated earlier acknowledgements of the “grave scandal” of child sexual abuse and the church’s failures to confront it, but he failed to address survivors’ growing demands for action.Francis said: “I cannot fail to acknowledge the grave scandal caused in Ireland by the abuse of young people by members of the church charged with responsibility for their protection and education.“The failure of ecclesiastical authorities – bishops, religious superiors, priests and others – adequately to address these repellent crimes has rightly given rise to outrage and remains a source of pain and shame for the Catholic community. I myself share those sentiments.”On Saturday evening, the pope spent more than an hour meeting privately with eight survivors of abuse committed by clerics or church institutions. In a statement, the survivors said Francis “condemned corruption and cover up within the church as ‘caca’. Literally filth as one sees in a toilet,” his translator clarified. Varadkar’s speech focused on the “dark aspects” of the Ireland’s history. “The failures of both church and state, and wider society, created a bitter and broken heritage for so many, leaving a legacy of pain and suffering. It is a history of sorrow and shame,” he said.Child sexual abuse, the Magdalene Laundries, mother and baby homes and illegal adoptions were “stains on our state, our society and also the Catholic church. People kept in dark corners behind closed doors, cries for help that went unheard.”The taoiseach also referred to the recent grand jury report on clerical abuse in Pennsylvania, talking of “brutal crimes perpetrated by people within the Catholic church, and then obscured to protect the institution at the expense of innocent victims”. “It is a story all too tragically familiar here in Ireland,” he said.He also said there was “much to be done to bring about justice and truth and healing for victims and survivors … We must now ensure that from words flow actions.”Turning to the profound changes in Irish society since the last papal visit in 1979, Varadkar said the country was more erse, less religious and had modernised its laws on orce, contraception, abortion and same sex marriage, “understanding that marriages do not always work, that women should make their own decisions, and that families come in many different, wonderful forms, including those headed by a grandparent, lone parent or same-sex parents, or parents who are orced”.The changes meant the time had come “for us to build a new, more mature relationship between church and state in Ireland – a new covenant for the 21st century”.It would be one “in which religion is no longer at the centre of our society, but in which it still has an important place”, he said.Pope Francis’s brief visit to Ireland has prompted demands for action at the highest levels of the church to deal with the systemic cover-up of abuse by priests and others.Although he received a rapturous welcome from thousands of pilgrims who have travelled to Ireland for the Catholic church’s World Meeting of Families, there are also protests over the church’s handling of clerical abuse scandals.As Francis celebrates mass with 500,000 people at Phoenix Park on Sunday, survivors of sexual abuse and their supporters will hold a vigil at Dublin’s Garden of Remembrance. Another vigil will be held at the site of a mass grave containing the remains of infants discovered last year at a Catholic mother-and-baby home in Tuam where almost 800 children died.Maeve Lewis of the survivors’ organisation One in Four said the pope’s speech at Dublin Castle was a missed opportunity to set out concrete steps to deal with child sex crimes in the Catholic church”. “Until recently the Vatican encouraged local bishops to deal discreetly with allegations, placing other children at risk,” she said. “No pope has ever accepted responsibility for the Vatican’s role in the cover-ups. Acknowledgement of this complicity would have been a good start in Dublin Castle today.“Survivors are weary of apologies that are not followed up with real action.”As Francis was driven through the centre of Dublinon Saturday afternoon, there was a generational ide in attitudes.Louise Clifford, 24, a designer from Limerick who now lives in the capital, said: “If this was 20 years ago this street would be full, but there are about 20 people and the pope is about to drive by.”She said she and her friends were “not really religious” but described herself as a “cultural Catholic”. “It’s the norm in Ireland,” she said.Bernard Connelly, 82, from Rimnheh on the outskirts of Dublin, was waiting eagerly. “I’ve seen five popes in my lifetime and I think Pope Francis is fantastic. He tells it like it is.“This abuse scandal has gone on for years and years. There is no getting away from it. Please God it will be fixed soon. Let’s hope Pope Francis is the man to do it.”According to Sarah Carolan, 33, there was a “nice buzz” around the pope’s visit. “I am Catholic but not a believer,” she said. “I was raised Catholic, married in church and all that craic. My sympathies are with the people who suffered at the hands of the church, but I also think there is good there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8f75ffa7bcb385367555c0949508e9a515b86e7/0_0_3038_1823/master/3038.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b1c71e058bb35f472f904713807687b","title":"four senior members afghan government resign","story":"Hanif Atmar’s exit, amid worsening security situation, is followed by ministers of defence and interiorAfghanistan’s national security adviser, Hanif Atmar, resigned on Saturday, sparking other resignations in the cabinet, in what observers believe could be the first move in a plan to run for the presidency in next year’s elections.He was one of the most influential advisers to President Ashraf Ghani and widely considered to be the second-most powerful official in Afghanistan.He became national security adviser after Ghani was sworn in as president in late 2014. Ghani’s office said the resignation had been accepted and announced his successor immediately, naming the Afghan ambassador to the United States, Hamdullah Mohib, as the replacement.Atmar, 49, said that he was stepping down due to the differences he had with the government on a political level, as well as their approach to maintaining peace and stability in the country. His resignation letter has not been released but it is said to have cited “serious differences over ­policies and principles with government leadership”.A senior official close to Atmar said the former security adviser was considering running against Ghani in the 2019 vote. “He has resigned because he is preparing to run for presidential election next year,” they said.The exact details of the rift with Ghani were not immediately clear but in the past week the Afghan government declined to attend peace talks hosted by Russia that representatives of the Taliban are expected to attend. Atmar, who began his security career with the Soviet Union-backed government in the late 1980s, is still seen as close to Russia.Sources close to the president were reported by two Afghan television stations to have said that Ghani asked all his security cabinet to step down before Atmar resigned. Late last night it was confirmed that the minister of defence, Tariq Shah Bahrami, the minister of the interior, Wais Barmak, and the National Directorate of Security chief, Masoom Stanekzai, had all done so.The reasons given by Ghani for the call for resignations was said to be the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan, amid deadly attacks carried out by suspected Islamic State militants, including last week’s rocket attack on the presidential palace and the recent Ghazni attack, and the increasing defence and security forces casualties. Afghan government officials were not immediately available to confirm the reported presidential directive.Atmar previously served as the minister of interior under former president Hamid Karzai. He was sacked in 2010 after Taliban insurgents attacked a “peace jirga” that was an early attempt at ending the 17-year-old war with the Taliban."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e5cfbb0058b24ca3cf1a658369485d0d481ae73/1273_292_1255_753/master/1255.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3756fbb5b8528f5bf412a9a9e831990f","title":"francos family vows to stop spanish dictators exhumation","story":"General’s grandchildren express ‘firm and unanimous’ opposition to moving dictator’s remains from mausoleumThe family of Spain’s late fascist dictator Francisco Franco will use all possible legal means to prevent a government plan to move their ancestor’s remains from a grand monument near Madrid. According to several national Spanish newspapers, seven grandchildren of Franco issued a statement expressing their “firm and unanimous” opposition to the exhumation. The statement, reported in El País, El Mundo and La Vanguardia among others, was a response to a decree passed on Friday to reduce the risk that legal claims could impede the plan, a longstanding ambition of the ruling Socialists.The Valley of the Fallen site, where Franco and tens of thousands of victims of Spain’s 1936-39 civil war are buried, has been criticised as Europe’s only remaining monument to a fascist leader.During Franco’s 1939-1975 rule – which remains a highly sensitive topic more than four decades after his death – tens of thousands of his enemies were killed and imprisoned in a campaign to wipe out dissent, while as many as 500,000 combatants and civilians died in the civil war, which split the nation in two.It was not immediately clear what legal avenues are open to Franco’s descendants in the face of a decree that needs to be approved by parliament, but is unlikely to be voted down. The statement said the family hoped the Benedictine order in charge of the site, which is marked by a 152-metre (500ft) high cross, would prevent the state’s “vengefulness”, the papers said. The decree gives the family 15 days from the end of August to decide where they want the remains to be taken, or cede that decision to the government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02f9953267c1c3bc2221dd73ef843bef7a86c89d/0_505_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c3e243725a629c9300c6440d167d99b","title":"tokyo tsukiji fish market moves","story":"The thousands of wholesalers who keep Tsukiji fish market running day and night have been at work for several hours when it starts filling up with weekend shoppers and tourists eager to sample the ultimate Tokyo culinary experience – a sushi breakfast.Long lines form outside restaurants as traders whizz past on small trucks laden with boxes of every type of seafood imaginable: huge slabs of tuna, hunks of whale bacon, octopuses, scallops and sea squirts.

In October the core of its business – the hundreds of wholesalers that provide seafood, meat, fruit and veg to restaurants and shops across Japan – will move two kilometres east to new waterfront premises in Tokyo’s Toyosu district. The many shops and restaurants crammed into the maze of narrow streets on the market’s periphery will remain, but its commercial heart – the wholesalers – will be transplanted to a new building that holds none of the charm of the current market, which has stood on the same site since 1935.About 1,800 tonnes of seafood, worth billions of yen, pass through the Tokyo central wholesale market – its official name – every day. In addition to almost 500 varieties of fish, it sells 270 types of fruit and vegetables imported from around the world. Its 42,000 workers keep the market running around the clock.The loss of the shitamachi (downtown) atmosphere that has turned Tsukiji into a major tourist attraction is not the only problem occupying the minds of market workers. They were supposed to have said farewell to their overcrowded, aging premises and moved to Toyosu in November 2016. But Tokyo’s governor, Yuriko Koike, abruptly halted the relocation after evidence emerged that the new site – built at a cost of 588bn yen (£4.1bn) – was contaminated with dangerous toxins.Surveys revealed levels of arsenic and cyanide above government-set standards. Benzene up to 100 times the limit was detected in groundwater, while mercury levels between five and seven times the national air quality standard were found in the new building’s basement. Red-faced authorities struggled to explain why contractors had failed to fill hollow concrete chambers beneath the building’s floor with clean soil to prevent chemical leaks.“No one has any idea how this is going to work out,” said Yoshinobu Uka, whose business specialises in tuna sushi from the Kochi region on Japan’s Pacific coast. “There will probably be a dip in customers to begin with, and road access to the new site is going to be a problem. Lots of people who work as wholesalers will leave, so that will affect the atmosphere.”Polls taken among the market’s 500 or so wholesalers found most were against the move. But earlier this month Koike confirmed the new market would open on 11 October after experts declared the area, formerly the site of a gas plant, safe following a cleanup operation.Tatemasa Hirata of the Open University of Tokyo, who headed the panel of experts, said: “Safety has been secured in the market’s ground area with consideration for future risks. It won’t affect human health or perishable foods.”Michiharu Chino is one of many Tsukiji employees who oppose the relocation, fearing that cautious clients will refuse to buy the new market’s produce while doubts persist over its safety.“I’m really worried about safety standards at the new place,” said Chino, who acts as an intermediary between wholesalers and clients. “I don’t believe Koike’s claim that Toyosu is safe, and I know that lots of my customers are nervous about it too. No one, especially people with young children, will want to eat fish that has been handled there. But now the decision has been made I have no choice but to go there for my seafood.”There is no shortage of evidence that the current site is poorly equipped to cope with demand. Its thousands of occupants and their growing array of produce outgrew their surroundings long ago, and its rickety buildings are vulnerable to earthquakes.The market’s structural flaws were exposed earlier this month when its aging air-conditioning system malfunctioned during a heatwave. The demolition of the market is expected to trigger a major exodus of rats to other parts of the neighbourhood.Preparations for the move will disappoint tourists, who from mid-September will no longer be able to observe auctions of enormous frozen tuna, snapped up before dawn each morning and sliced up with bandsaws and frighteningly sharp knives before being shipped to restaurants and supermarkets. A spokeswoman for the market said public viewings of the auction would be revived at the new site, with tourists able to watch tuna being sold along a specially built aisle.But shopkeeper Hitoshi Sannohe believes that what is left of Tsukiji will continue to attract visitors after the wholesalers have moved on, citing Koike’s plans to turn the area into a “food theme park”.“Tourists come here to eat and take in the traditional atmosphere, and I don’t think that’s going to change,” said Sannohe, whose store has been selling dried seafood at Tsukiji for 40 years. “But we’re going into uncharted territory, as the market has been in the same place for such a long time. I and other shop owners are uneasy about the future, but all we can do is wait and see.”Robbie Swinnerton, a food writer for the Japan Times, is confident that standards will be maintained at the new site, with seafood stored more hygienically and sent on to customers faster than is possible now.But, he adds, the relocation will also mean the loss of a cherished part of Tokyo’s history and culture.“I really see this as the end of an era,” he said. “Tsukiji is the last bastion of traditional shitamachi culture, which has already been eroded by tourism and redevelopment. When it goes, Tokyo will lose a large part of its soul.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15f39024ac9884d9d9f01308e5f05625a4bf2a04/0_95_4016_2409/master/4016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f934d87d0e36beee3458ff5061ad37b3","title":"weden democrats far right flourished elite lost touch","story":"Whatever the result of the general election, Sweden Democrats’ nationalist stance is now part of the political conversationThe Sweden Democrats look at first sight like any of the other anti-immigrant and populist parties that have spread across Europe in the last decade. They are said to be Steve Bannon’s favourite party with their programme of xenophobia and cultural nationalism – the 1950s, but with mobile phones, as one of their founders once told a journalist.They have risen from the extreme fringes to a position where they have completely jammed up the traditional power blocs of Swedish politics, which since 1976 have been based around the competition between the Social Democrats and a grouping of three or four non-socialist parties. None of the mainstream parties will co-operate with them, but neither bloc can form a majority government without them.Yet on closer inspection, they are a very Swedish phenomenon. In Denmark, Norway, and Finland, parties that share their ferociously anti-immigrant message have long been admitted to government and form part of the normal political process. Swedish mainstream parties, though they have adopted many of the Sweden Democrats’ policies since the great U-turn on immigration of 2015, have simply refused to acknowledge their existence. Political scientist Olof Petersson says one of the distinctive features of Swedish political culture is that it is both more authoritarian and more democratic than the European norm: in the Swedish model, authority consults widely, but is obeyed when it reaches a decision. There is always an elite consensus at the apex of Swedish society, and at any given time a very narrow range of acceptable views, but these can suddenly change, as did attitudes to the old welfare state after an economic crisis in the 1990s, or attitudes to refugees in 2015. The decision in 1994 to join the EU followed another sudden change of mind at the top of the Social Democratic party, communicated quickly and effectively to an initially unwilling membership.The drawback of all authoritarian systems is that the people at the top will hear only what they want to, and gradually lose touch with reality. What prevented this in Sweden for most of the 20th century was mass membership of political parties on a scale hard to imagine in Britain. In 1983, nearly a quarter of the population was enrolled in a political party. More than 1 million people out of a population of 8 million were members of the Social Democrats (I was myself, as the union representative in the small factory where I worked).The parties functioned almost as social media do today, says Petersson. Young people joined to meet others, especially in the country. And because they were so embedded in everyday life, party officials had a very good idea of what ordinary, unpolitical people were talking about. Since then, membership has collapsed to levels scarcely above those of British counterparts. About half the membership of the Social Democrats vanished with the abolition of collective membership through the unions. By 2010 the party had only 109,000 members. There was no longer any mechanism by which the leadership on Stockholm could be told things they did not want to hear.That was the void in which the Sweden Democrats flourished. Originally a neo-Nazi sect, which was taken over and cleaned up by four student politicians, it was the only party that spoke out against the consensus on immigration. The mainstream parties tried for years to ignore them entirely.Just before they entered parliament for the first time, in 2010, I asked the minister for integration what her plans were for when they got in (as the polls showed they would) and she replied that it was unthinkable they should. No thought was duly given. So now the party has grown to be the third – and will quite possibly soon be the second – largest in the country.But it is still a captive of the authoritarianism from which it benefited. Unlike true fascist movements, it has no coherent plan to reshape the state, and no views on capitalism. It just believes the wrong people are running the right system. In that sense it is already a part of Swedish political life, whatever the result of the election.Andrew Brown is the author of Fishing in Utopia (Granta), a memoir of his life in Sweden that won the Orwell Prize"},{"url":null,"title":"smart","story":"Practical, hands-on courses offer career progression and skills enhancement outside traditional CAO system"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Pontiff addresses crowd of 82,000 at Croke Park at the end of the first day of his visitPontiff met and talked to families who shared their stories and posed for selfies with children\u0026lsquoIt was fabulous, but a bit quick, I wonder if he was abiding the speed limit, as he just flew by\u0026rsquoPontiff uses Spanish word \u0026lsquocaca\u0026rsquo during 90 minute meeting with survivors of clerical sex abuseMany commented on the speed at which motorcade travelled through the city centreGarda\u0026iacute arrest man in operation targeting sale of illegal drugs in the countyMarch led by those who were prominent in the civil rights movementColm O\u0026rsquoGorman said it is \u0026lsquomind boggling to me that to ask a pope to tell the damn truth is a radical thing to suggest\u0026rsquoStudent notes importance of facing challenges, says visit offers opportunity to do thatCar discovered in river near the Quay Road in Newport early on Saturday morningFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader Miche\u0026aacutel Martin said he would have appreciated \u0026lsquoa greater focus on the actions that should follow\u0026rsquoLifeboat davit is the largest artefact recovered from wreck of the liner sunk in WW1Varadkar refers to \u0026lsquopeople kept in dark corners, behind closed doors\u0026rsquo whose cries of help went unheardFailure has \u0026lsquorightly given rise to outrage and remains a source of pain and shame\u0026rsquoFormer resident at Nazareth House calls on pope to do something for the survivorsPontiff has no plans to announce measures to address clerical abuse during Ireland visit\u0026lsquoIn January my faith was shattered when our daughter was diagnosed with leukemia\u0026rsquoAlmost five kilos of heroin and crack cocaine were seized in a house search in BluebellIndependent report identifies \u0026lsquoconfusion\u0026rsquo in relation to oversight of air-sea search and rescue"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3607975.1535227034!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fintan o toole this visit feels too much like a ceremonial procession","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPope Francis arrives to attend the Festival of Families at Croke Park. Photograph: Getty ImagesEarly mediaeval bishops used to sign their communications with the formula “peccator episcopus” – sinner and bishop. Pope Francis came to Ireland in a somewhat similar mood. His quietly rueful demeanour could hardly present a starker contrast to the radiant charisma and supreme self-confidence of his predecessor John Paul II in 1979. But “peccator episcopus” is a hard trick to pull off when you happen to be bishop of Rome. However much Francis may wish to have come among us as a humble sinner, he cannot escape the reality that he heads an institution that is struggling to fully confess its sins, let alone do penance for them.Francis is not a pompous man, but pomp and ceremony come with the job. If it’s your job to be driven down O’Connell Street in a transparent vehicle bestowing blessings on all and sundry, it is not easy to be what Francis surely is: a decent man struggling to articulate the “shame, pain and outrage” he says he feels for his church’s systematic covering-up of child abuse. The crowds may be modest and the atmosphere low key. But the papacy can’t quite shake off its heritage as the successor to the Roman empire and even Francis can’t entirely avoid seeming like an emperor on tour to a far-flung province.Thus, on the one hand, he can seem genuinely at ease among so-called ordinary people in the Capuchin day centre and Sean McDermott Street. And he was probably just as much at ease with President Michael D Higgins, whose passions for social justice and environmental sustainability he shares. If his visit were not so bafflingly short and he had taken the time to do what he does best – spend time with people who are marginalised and suffering – he might really have made a difference. He might have revivified the sense of Christianity as a radical option for the poor as opposed to a form of institutional power. But this visit feels too much like a ceremonial procession with a pastoral purpose added in as an afterthought for that to be possible.And on the other hand, for all his obvious sympathy with suffering, Francis still failed to rise to the obvious need to embody a church that is genuinely shocked at its own deep moral failings. It was a truly woeful idea for Francis to seek to provide reassurance by suggesting as the gold standard of contrition the open letter his predecessor Pope Benedict sent to Irish Catholics in 2010: “His frank and decisive intervention continues to serve as an incentive for the efforts of the Church’s leadership both to remedy past mistakes and to adopt stringent norms meant to ensure that they do not happen again.”It is hard to understand how Francis imagined that stressing the continuity of the church’s response to child abuse was a good idea when a radical break with the past is so obviously necessary. If Benedict’s response to the crisis was “frank and decisive”, how come the hidden truths are continuing to emerge? How come no independent observers, or indeed most of the Irish bishops, believe that Benedict’s actions were even vaguely adequate, let alone decisive?Usually, when someone comes to visit, you get to know them better. But Francis seems even more enigmatic for his presence among us. How can someone have such a warm human touch on the one hand and be so terribly out of touch on the other? How can he be so deeply sympathetic to human suffering and so apparently unable to do the things that would stop it? It is as hard not to warm to him as it is to figure out how his humble humanity sits with his aura of ine power.Pope Francis to preside over the closing ceremony of World Meeting of Families in Dublin.

The company said it was shocked to learn that some of the letters of support for its planning application sent to Clare County Council were forged. Photograph: Joe O\u0027ShaughnessyIf the large-scale motorway service station that Supermac’s entrepreneur Pat McDonagh wants to build near Ennis in Co Clare is ever constructed, it will certainly be a feature on the landscape.But its critics say it will have a “significant negative impact” on the vitality and viability of the town centre of Ennis and two local villages, as well as breaching the policy of the Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) in relation to services on the motorway network.Supermac’s Ireland, a fast-food and retail franchise, initially sought to distance itself from this week’s controversy over forged letters of support, sent to Clare County Council among a batch of 187 submissions delivered en masse to the planning department just before the deadline for such observations.However, the admission by Pat McDonagh, Supermac’s founder, that his company agreed to underwrite the cost of the support campaign (which could run to €3,600) has placed more question marks over the whole affair.The company had said it was shocked to learn that some of the submissions were made by people who had not, in fact, written the letters bearing their names. It condemned the action “utterly” and said it disowned such support.The company is keen, nonetheless, to press on with its plans, but it is facing an amount of stiff opposition. Then came the acknowledgement that the company was financially connected to the campaign (although it says that it has yet to actually pay for the cost of the submissions).The plan remains on the table, as it were, and the council is due to make its decision by September 4th. Whether approved or rejected, it would seem likely that the losing side will appeal to An Bord Pleanála.The plan is for the development of a 4.8-hectare site just off the M18 LimerickGalway motorway at Junction 12, some 4.8km east of Ennis, and 3.5km east of the adjoining village of Clarecastle.If given the go-ahead, Mr McDonagh and Supermac’s want to construct a centrally located two-storey building with a total floor area of 2,564sq m, with 100sq m allocated for retail and 710sq m allocated for eating and seating.In addition, there would be staff and office facilities of some 188sq m, a travel and tourist information centre of 148sq m, and toilets, storage and maintenance space amounting to just under 1,000sq m.There would be parking for 142 cars, eight motorbikes, 10 coaches and 15 HGV vehicles.Ennis prides itself on being a commercially successful place in challenging times. People connected to the local chamber of commerce will tell anyone who asks that the town had six retail outlets ranked within the country’s top 100, as defined by Retail Excellence Ireland. The town has also been declared Ireland’s friendliest.So it is perhaps not surprising that local vested interests came together to oppose a plan which they say “will rip the heart out of the town”, as a spokesperson put it.Nine of them, all members of the chamber of commerce, came together and submitted a 50-page objection.The nine are the Old Ground Hotel, the Temple Gate Hotel, Hotel Woodstock, Treacy’s West County Hotel, Ryan’s Centra supermarket, Hogan’s Mace supermarket, the County Boutique, the Woollen Market and Clarke’s Daybreak supermarket and petrol station.They look at Mr McDonagh’s Barack Obama Plaza motorway service area at Moneygall and see its mirror image near their town. And when they do, they see their businesses, and the jobs and life they argue they bring to Ennis, as under serious threat.According to their submission, if the plan gets approval it will have a “significant negative impact on the vitality and viability of Ennis town centre, Clarecastle village centre and Crusheen village centre which is contrary to the policies of the Clare County Development plan 2017-2023”.They argue that the proposal is also against the policy of Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), which devises policies in relation to services on the country’s motorway network.According to TII, motorway service areas (MSAs) are “essential for driver safety and to ensure the availability of services and amenities for drivers”.In line with this, TII says there should be one “on-line service area” on the M18 between junctions 7 (which is Sixmilebridge) and 12 (which is Ennis). The “on-line” element is central to objections to the McDonagh plan.On-line means the services offered are accessed directly from the motorway. In other words, drivers leave the carriageway and drive straight into the service area, as is the case on various Applegreen service areas on, for instance, the M4 and M1.The Ennis service area would be “off-line” meaning the motorists would have to exit the motorway proper, enter other roads and drive to the service area, albeit a short distance.Mr McDonagh has twice before sought permission to develop the site. One application was turned down by An Bord Pleanála the other was withdrawn.In rejecting the first application, the board cited problems with access roads, and Clare council policies of “maintaining high-quality built and natural environment”.“The board considers that the proposed development, by reason of its design . . . would not integrate satisfactorily with the rural and predominately flat landscape in the hinterland of Ennis.”Pat McDonagh will be hoping that, this time, it is third time lucky."},{"url":null,"title":"pope francis welcomed by president michael d higgins","story":"  August 25, 2018Pontiff addresses crowd of 82,000 at Croke Park at the end of the first day of his visit   August 25, 2018Minister addresses him in the language of her forebears and Francis replies in English "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

silver roman coins unearthed group friends","story":"Paul King and Robert Hamer form Priscan Archaeology, who were responsible for finding the siteA hoard of 2,000-year-old silver Roman coins has been unearthed by three metal-detecting friends in Yorkshire.Such a find would be thrilling enough, but it has also led to a further significant discovery - evidence of a high-status Roman settlement, to the excitement of archaeologists, The  can reveal.The hoard was unearthed by Paul King, a semi-retired logistics manager, and his friends Robert Hamer and Robin Siddle.Weather permitting, they go out most weekends, with a shared passion for learning about the past, rather than hunting for treasure.  Criss-crossing nine counties over many years, they have discovered various gems, including a medieval pilgrim’s badge, but nothing quite as significant as their Roman hoard of 18 silver coins.Although they discovered it in 2015, it has been kept secret until now, to enable archaeologists to explore the site first.  Last week, two of the friends were working alongside archaeologists as yet more silver coins were uncovered, with hundreds of Roman pottery sherds and a tiny brooch, found on one of three neonatal burials.   Roman Denarius of Titus dating from 79-81 ADChris Casswell, who is heading the excavation, said: “It’s a beautiful little brooch… The kind of size to keep a cloak around a baby. It\u0027s so small and delicate, still completely intact.”  He said that they have only scratched the surface of the site, whose discovery is “very exciting and important”, partly because it is one of the earliest Roman settlements to have been found. “We have discovered evidence for… a high-status site.”  He noted that plenty of pottery has been found at other Roman sites, but that it is often “bog-standard, run-of-the-mill stuff”.Examples found at this site are very different, he added: “Someone forked out quite a bit of money for it… There are decorated bowls and amphorae, which would have transported olive oil and wine from the Mediterranean. Lots of really fine pottery.”The hoard was unearthed by Paul King, a semi-retired logistics manager, and his friends Robert Hamer and Robin SiddleKing recalled the signal from the metal-detector while they were out field-walking. They found themselves digging up coins, some of which were stuck together: “Straight away we knew it was a hoard.”  The excavation is being conducted by DigVentures, founded by archaeologists in 2012 to fill the gap left by severe cuts to research archaeology by universities and local authorities.Casswell praised King and his friends, who acted responsibly in reporting their discovery to the Portable Antiquities Scheme, which encourages the recording of archaeological objects found by members of the public. A coroner will decide ownership of treasures such as these silver coins.Asked about the rarity of such a Roman settlement in Britain, he said that, while there are examples from the 3rd and 4th centuries, “it is rare to find one of such an early date”. The evidence at this site includes post-holes and foundation trenches, with the remnants of stone walls that once stood there.  The excavation is being conducted by DigVentures, founded by archaeologists in 2012King used to work as a logistics manager, looking after fleets of vehicles and a warehouse. He developed a passion for metal-detecting many years ago, teaching himself by reading books on history and archaeology: “They call us detectologists… a blend between archaeologists and detectorists because we’re quite knowledgeable.”  He added:  “You just want to know about things. How did people live? What did they do? When you pick up that Roman coin out of the ground, after it’s been there for 2,000 years, it still puts tingles up my spine that the last person to touch that coin was a Roman… It’s fascinating.”  Lisa Westcott Wilkins of DigVentures asked the Sunday  not to identify the site’s location because of the danger of night-hawkers. There is now a high level of surveillance on the site.  The project is partly funded by a £61,100-grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. An important part of DigVentures’ work is accessibility and they will present the finds at various public events.  They are also involving the public through their DigNation festival, taking place in September on Lindisfarne, with lectures and the chance to experience excavations, among other events. GPs receiving payments for 3.6 million \u0026#39ghost patients\u0026#39Surgeons to use

shame, the Pope has told an audience in Ireland.Beginning a two-day visit to the country on Saturday, Pope Francis said he cannot fail to acknowledge the grave scandal that abuse by Catholic priests had caused, describing it as a “scourge in the Church”.He said the failure of religious leaders including bishops to address the repellent crimes had rightly given rise to outrage.His comments came after Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar called on him to implement a zero tolerance approach to abusers and those who participated in cover-ups. We must now ensure that from words flow actions, he said.He said Irish scandals including Magdalene Laundries, industrial schools, mother and baby homes, illegal adoptions, and clerical abuse were stains on our State, our society, and also the Catholic Church.Failures had created a bitter and broken heritage for so many, leaving a legacy of pain and suffering, he said, adding that survivors were “kept in dark corners, behind closed doors”.The Pope\u0026#039s visit to Ireland, in picturesHis words echoed the calls of victims\u0027 and survivors\u0027 groups, who criticised a Pontifical letter issued on Monday for failing to include concrete provisions to bring abusers to justice.Campaigners say the Vatican knows the identity of senior figures who have aided abusers by moving them to different areas and failing to report them to police, but has not taken action against them.The Pope also met with victims and survivors of abuse on Saturday in a private event, and then addressed more than 80,000 people at Dublin\u0027s Croke Park stadium for the Festival of Families.The concert-type event was held to mark the end of the World Meeting of Families 2018, including performances by Andrea Bocelli, The Riverdance Troupe, Nathan Carter, Dana Masters and Daniel O\u0027Donnell.Pope Francis delivered an address and heard five testimonies by families from Ireland, Canada, India, Iraq, and Africa about the importance of family in the modern age.Earlier, as he left Dublin Castle to drive through the city in a blue Skoda the Pope was greeted by a group of advocates holding a banner calling for redress for victims.Other placards urged him not to forget abuse survivors. His visit has drawn comparisons to an earlier visit by Pope John Paul II in 1979, at which 2.7m people greeted him and more than a million attended a Mass in the city’s Phoenix Park.Pope Francis disembarks from the aircraft as he arrives at Dublin InternationalThe figures for this year’s event are not yet know, but the pavement behind the barriers outside the castle was not full and many of those watching were there to protest.However, crowds later packed the streets in areas such as Dame Street, with supporters cheering and waving flags, as he processed through in the Pope-mobile.On Sunday he will conduct a papal mass in the same location, with half a million expected to attend. A Facebook group, Say Nope to the Pope, which has 6,300 members, has prompted some to obtain a free ticket with no intention of going, as a gesture of protest against a series of issues including the church’s involvement in Irish politics and stances on LGBT and women’s equality.Pope Francis plants a tree during a meeting with Irish President Michael D Higgins, at Aras an Uachtarain in Phoenix ParkThe weather could also lead some to stay away, with heavy rain predicted to fall all morning. On Saturday afternoon he attended a meeting at St Mary\u0027s Pro Cathedral attended by 370 couples who were either newlywed or recently married.He remained with his head bowed for several minutes in front of the candle of innocence, which has been burning in the cathedral since 2011 as an acknowledgment of the suffering caused to survivors of abuse.In his speeches the Pope also hinted at the recent referendum in which the Irish voted overwhelmingly to repeal the Eighth Amendment, paving the way for widely legalised abortion.LGBT protestors from Dublin Pride and We Are Church with flags and umbrellas on Ha\u0026#39Penny BridgeSpeaking at Dublin Castle, he suggested that “the growth of a materialistic ‘throwaway culture’ has in fact made us increasingly indifferent to the poor and to the most vulnerable members of our human family, including the unborn, deprived of the very right to life?”Later, at the cathedral, he added: “The world tells us to be strong and independent, with little care for those who are alone and sad, rejected or sick, not yet born or dying”.However, his counsel for the couples also included some levity. Looking at the congregation compromising hundreds of young couples he questioned those that claimed people no longer wanted to get married. Getting married and sharing your lives is a beautiful thing, he told them.He said older people had great wisdom, then joked: Even the mothers-in-law, even they are wise.Pope Francis speaks to the audience at Croke Park Stadium in Dublin, during the Festival of Families eventOutside the service, couples expressed hope that the Pope could bring about change. Katie Boland, 30, and her husband Oisin, 32, from Dublin, who married in June, acknowledged that Ireland was less religious that it used to be. That\u0027s the reality. Maybe things will change going forward, said Mrs Boland, if his messages are more modern and connect to people now. Belinda Maguire and Paul Friel, from Donegal, both 26, who are marrying in 2020, said they thought people in their parish were still devout. We were both brought up in a Catholic family so I\u0027ve never noticed any difference to be honest, said Ms Maguire.To come here today was just an honour, to see him in person and everything.GPs receiving payments for 3.6 million \u0026#39ghost patients\u0026#39Surgeons to use \u0026#39hologram\u0026#39 goggles to see inside

minister julie bishop resigns cabinet","story":"Australia\u0026#39s incumbent Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull walks with Foreign Minister Julie BishopAustralian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said on Sunday she has resigned from new Prime Minister Scott Morrison\u0027s Cabinet, two days after a bruising leadership battle that toppled former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull.Bishop announced she would move to the backbench and had not yet decided whether to contest the next election, which is due by May 2019. That decision could have serious implications for Morrison\u0027s government, which has a parliamentary majority of only one seat.Morrison emerged as the surprise winner of Friday\u0027s party-room vote to replace Turnbull after a week of political chaos in Canberra that marked the emergence of Australia\u0027s sixth prime minister in less than 10 years.He took over as leader of the Liberal Party, the senior partner in a Liberal-National coalition that has consistently trailed the opposition Labor party in opinion polls in recent months.Bishop contested Friday\u0027s vote but was eliminated in the first round, with Morrison then emerging as a surprise compromise winner over Peter Dutton, Turnbull\u0027s conservative challenger who brought the leadership crisis to a head earlier in the week.I will remain on the backbench as a strong voice for Western Australia, Bishop said in a statement soon after she arrived back in her home state.The possibility that Bishop could leave parliament before the next election will be a major concern for Morrison, Turnbull\u0027s former treasurer, because it opens the possibility of another by-election being held for her seat.His party will already have to contest a by-election for Turnbull\u0027s harbourside electorate in Sydney, traditionally a safe Liberal seat. Turnbull\u0027s resignation from parliament was expected in the coming week.Morrison has spent his first two full days in power working on a new Cabinet, although the only confirmed change so far is that his Liberal deputy and former energy minister Josh Frydenburg will take over as treasurer. GPs receiving payments for 3.6 million \u0026#39ghost patients\u0026#39Surgeons to use \u0026#39hologram\u0026#39 goggles to see inside children\u0026#39s hearts Family court judge who inspired new BBC film The Children Act speaks of heartbreak over harrowing caseGamers as young as 12 have suffered deep vein thrombosis after hardly moving for three hours, study findsSajid Javid urges Interpol to prevent the \u0026#39abuse\u0026#39 of its network by states targeting dissidentsMay\u0026#39s housing adviser backs campaign to force landowners to offer huge discount on their landTributes to \u0026#39true American patriot\u0026#39 John McCain cross political ideUS senator John McCain dies aged 81 after battle with brain cancerJohn McCain and Donald Trump: no love lostYouTube stars KSI and Logan Paul draw in fight dubbed \u0026#39the biggest internet event in history\u0026#39Cruise ship rescues three men after fishing boat sinks as coastguard searches for two more Two-in-one pill for blood pressure will \u0026#39save thousands of lives\u0026#39NHS urgent cancer referral targets missed for first timeDeath of British couple at Thomas Cook hotel not due to gas emissions, says Egyptian prosecutorJeremy Corbyn must come clean about \u0026#39deeply troubling\u0026#39 meetings with Hamas, says former ambassador to Saudi ArabiaLeave Means Leave campaign group  building £5m war chest to fight \u0026#39dilution\u0026#39 of BrexitMore than a million GCSE results could be open to challenge due toEdinburgh University student union officials to hand out pronounVideo game music is just as good an introduction to classical music for children as a concert, arts chief says Northern Ireland Secretary among  MPs and peers who give \u0026#39lobbyist spouses\u0026#39 access to ParliamentWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/08/26/TELEMMGLPICT000172397654_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqxTgV-VEbjByvRp9E0Pb-y4euE8mO3loKfLBNcbArYqo.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"tributes true american patriot john mccain cross political divide","story":"Republican politician Senator John McCain with wife Cindy in 2008Friends, family and the top tiers of US politics lined up to pay tribute to politician and celebrated war veteran John McCain after his death on Saturday. Senator John Sidney McCain III died at 4:28pm on August 25, 2018.

The IPO of a 5 per cent chunk of the company would be the biggest stock market float on record, with an estimated value of $2 trillion (£1.6 trillion), and would be expected to raise up to $100bn for Saudi Arabia. The move has been in the works for several years\u0026nbspbut no date or location has been set\u0026nbspand, on Wednesday, Reuters reported the flotation had been shelved. The news service said Saudi Arabia had pulled the domestic and international listings of Aramco and cited senior industry sources. It also reported advisers working on the deal had been disbanded. The news followed reports this year the chances of the kingdom continuing with plans for an international listing were “diminishing”. However on Thursday, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister\u0026nbspKhalid al-Falih said: “The government remains committed to the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, in accordance with the appropriate circumstances and appropriate time chosen by the government.”The Saudi government also said, in preparation for the listing, it had “undertaken a number of major preparatory measures, including issuing a new income tax law as it relates to hydrocarbons activities reissuing a long term exclusive concession and appointing a new board of directors, amongst other measures to safeguard its interests and those of the company’s future private shareholders”.Chance of Aramco listing in London or New York ‘may be diminishing’Public listing of Saudi oil company may be delayed until 2019UK Government agrees $2bn loan guarantee for Saudi AramcoLondon, New York and Hong Kong are among potential hosts for the record breaking IPO. The kingdom’s denial of the IPO cancellation will come as a relief to bankers and advisers who stand to make $200m from the float. According to reports, international banks JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and HSBC were appointed as global coordinators and boutique investment banks Moelis \u0026amp Co and Evercore were chosen as independent advisors. Law firm White \u0026amp Case was reportedly selected as legal adviser for the float.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/21/13/nicki-minaj.jpg","title":"bts idol nicki minaj love yourself answer korea boy band","story":"Created with Sketch.The rapper recently released her album \u0027Queen\u0027Click to followThe Independent CultureKorean boy band BTS have added a remix of the song “IDOL” to their new album Love Yourself: Answer, now featuring American rapper Nicki Minaj.The group’s label, Big Hit Entertainment, announced the track’s addition to the highly-anticipated record just two hours before release.While not featured on the physical release, the remix appears on the digital versions of the album.Seoul Economic Daily reports that BTS – whose last album reached number one in the US charts – reached out to Minaj after they finished recording Answer.Rumours of the collaboration started circulating on social media earlier this week.

It was a fairly low-key event, with a portable stage not much bigger than the park’s bandstand. The lineup was comprised of mainly tribute acts.Fast forward to 2018, and Bingley Music Live, as the event evolved into, is preparing for its biggest three-day festival yet, on the weekend of Friday 31 August. This time the roster is a little more impressive: Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, Jake Bugg, Public Image Ltd, Shed Seven, former Spice Girl Melanie C… and all on a stage that wouldn’t be out of place at one of the summer’s big-name festivals.But, so what? Festivals are big business in the UK, and the summer calendar is stuffed with internationally-renowned acts zipping between fields across the country. Just down the road from Bradford, the Leeds Festival is twinned with its more venerable cousin Reading, and together they form the apex of the festival pyramid with old-stager Glastonbury (when it’s not having a fallow year, like this summer).But also on the calendar is Latitude, the Isle of Wight Festival, RiZE (formerly the V Festival), Wireless, Creamfields, BBC Music’s Big Weekend, Bestival… it seems that no matter where you are in the country, sling a 12in picture disc like a frisbee any time over the summer and you’re almost certain to hit a music superstar on the head.But what makes Bingley Music Live a slightly different beast is that just like the inaugural Music at Myrtle\u0026nbspevent in 1991, it is still run by the local authority. No longer free, of course, because you don’t get Noel Gallagher out of bed on the sort of money you can make up by adding a few quid on the council tax bills. But value for money certainly, compared to the big commercial festivals, and certainly pulling its weight in the ring with many of them.A spokesperson for Bradford Council said\u0026nbspthat when Music at Myrtle was set up in 1991, nobody really expected that it would become the major player it is now. She says:\u0026nbsp“When we held our first small free concert few could have envisaged that the festival would grow to attract such big names as Pet Shop Boys, Kaiser Chiefs, Manic Street Preachers, Chic and Nile Rogers, All Saints, Jess Glynne\u0026nbspand James who have all played over recent years.”The key, though, is that Bingley Music Live has grown organically. Bradford Council never set out to make a full-blown festival, it expanded a little bit year by year. She adds:\u0026nbsp“Although it has come a long way from its humble beginnings and it is unusual for a council to be involved in such a big festival we have grown it gradually and now it sees 15,000 people a day flock to the town for festival weekend.”\u0026nbspIn its early years, Music at Myrtle was split into themed days, with old rockers such as Bradford’s own Smokie on the bill, newer bands for the younger audience, and jazz. In 1998 Bradford Council partnered with local radio station Pulse to make the event a two-day festival, with Pulse using their clout and contacts book to bring in bigger names such as Liberty X, McFly, Rachel Stevens and another Bradford boy-done-good, Gareth Gates.That continued into the 2000s, until what was then billed as the Party in the Park hit its first major bump in the road. In February 2007, the event was summarily cancelled. Rising costs and declining audiences were blamed, and the Pulse’s station director, Tony Wilkinson, told the local paper,\u0026nbsp and\u0026nbspArgus, that support from the music industry for such small festivals was on the wane. He said that the record labels did not have “as many artists out on promotional tours to provide a top class running order”.Despite its small size, the festival has attracted larger, mainstream acts such as Maximo ParkWhat nobody envisaged in 2007, though, was that the music industry was in the throes of a massive shakeup. Downloading and streaming of music was in its infancy then, and music acts still made the majority of their money from physical album and single sales. However, a decade on, that situation is reversed nowadays it’s the touring of live shows and pounding the festival beat that earns pop and rock bands a crust.It would be nice to think that Bradford Council was playing something of a blinder back in 2007, but the chances are that it was pure serendipity. Either way, within a couple of months of the announcement that the Myrtle Park festival was dead, it rose from the ashes.The original plan was to scale back on the A-listers and give more of a platform to unknown, local bands. The rescue package had been put together wholly by Bradford Council, and they were obviously mindful of the budgetary restrictions of putting on a big festival but still wanting to provide residents with a music event of some description.Indeed, it was the residents of Bingley in particular who lobbied the council to save the festival in some form. This was at a time when the financial crisis was just bubbling over, and it’s fair to say that Bradford had been hit harder than most cities. Neighbouring Leeds had stolen a march on city centre development and by the mid-2000s had a thriving retail and leisure sector that put it in a stronger position to weather the credit crunch.aren’t too far removed from its neighbouring Leeds\u0026nbspBefore the financial collapse, Bradford had been on the up as well. Large swathes of the city centre had been demolished to make way for a brand new shopping centre built by Westfield. The majority of the work on taking down the tired, old buildings began in 2004, but by 2007 everything had stalled, leaving Bradford with an infamous hole in the ground that made it look as though it was ground zero of a meteor strike. It wasn’t until 2015 that the centre was completed and opened… and, to be fair, did help to kickstart a much-needed revitalisation of Bradford.So it was understandable in that atmosphere in 2007 that people wanted some form of entertainment, and Bingley Music Live was it. That year’s festival was indeed\u0026nbsppared down, but still attracted some recognisable names – Bruce Foxton’s post-Paul Weller “From The Jam” outfit, the Charlatans, the Bluetones. The following year brought the Happy Mondays, Echo and the Bunnymen, and local heroes Terrorvision.\u0026nbspBy the time the first headliners the Charlatans returned in 2012, the festival had added a third day on the Friday, and the festival was really on an upward curve.But can a local authority really justify the cost? There are partners of course, including Ticketline, Mercure Hotels and Carlsberg. But surely it doesn’t make any money?According to a Bradford Council reply to a freedom of information request last month asking for income and expenditure on Bingley Music Live over the past three years, in 2015 there was income of £946,000 against just over £1m in costs. In 2016 income was down at £822,000 against very similar costs, but last year, with costs standing at £1.15m, there was gross income of £1.3m… leaving a net surplus of £222,000.Having attended the event last year, those figure’s aren’t surprising. It was packed and money was flowing over the bars and food concessions. It’s also a very family-oriented event. And with ticket sales ensuring 15,000 come through the gates every day this year –\u0026nbspwhich the coup of booking Noel Gallagher has certainly helped with –\u0026nbspit looks likely that Bingley Music Live is on an upward trend.Being in the middle of one of the Bradford district’s big towns as well, rather than in splendid isolation on a field somewhere in Hampshire, there are extra benefits. My council spokesperson says: “The event is a big thing for Bingley’s businesses, with its many excellent pubs, bars, shops and places to eat all busy with people for the full weekend. The festival is also embraced by the local Bradford and Bingley Sports Club who provide camping for festivalgoers on their fields.”Ariana Grande and James Corden perform hit-filled version of TitanicWhy drag queen Vicky Vox is starring in Little Shop of HorrorsCamp Bestival forced to close early due to poor weather conditionsWhile Bingley Music Live might be unusual in being local authority-run, its model of being an “urban festival” is one that is becoming increasingly popular… and can pay idends for local economies.Journalist Claude Lynch, writing in CityMetric earlier this year, said that while the big, camp-out-all-weekend festivals were declining, smaller, urban festivals were thriving… and possibly because of a sense of community. He wrote: “Multiple studies into the dynamics and economics of festivals make similar arguments about how to drive ‘re-patronising’ – in other words, how to make festivalgoers want to come back next year. Evidence suggests that ‘social identification’ – having something in common with other festivalgoers – is often just as important as the quality of the music or the food. Festivals can capitalise on this boon of social identification by offering a self-contained event designed\u0026nbspwith both locals and tourists in mind. Locals are more likely to patronise events that emphasise community spirit while tourists are enthused by events that symbolise and epitomise the local culture.”From very humble beginnings 27 years ago, Bingley Music Live has survived and thrived, often against the odds, and when international superstar Noel Gallagher takes the stage in a couple of weeks’ time, it will be the culmination of the dogged determination that gets things done in this part of the world… and looks like providing the template for the future of live music.For more information go to bingleymusicliveMusic at MyrtleEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Despite its small size, the festival has attracted larger, mainstream acts such as Maximo Park"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/16/south-africa-school.jpg","title":"south africa corruption president ramaphosa mabuza zuma anc","story":"Created with Sketch.The ruling African National Congress pledges education and opportunity\u0026nbspfor black people\u0026nbsp– but embezzlement in the\u0026nbspdeputy president’s province has left schools so decrepit that children plunge to their death in toiletsClick to followThe IndependentSchool at Orange Farm, near Soweto: one of the ANC’s policies is to improve education for black South African childrenZiyanda\u0026nbspNkosi hated going to the bathroom at school. The pit toilets were so dark, dirty and crumbling. Many children were so afraid of them that they simply relieved themselves in the schoolyard to avoid the ordeal.But as she played with her best friend during recess, the little girl, a six-year-old first-grader, really had to go. She stepped warily inside the closet-like latrine.Even with the gentle pressure of her tiny frame, the floor caved in. Ziyanda flailed wildly, clinging to the edges of the hole, frantically trying to keep herself from falling in and drowning in the fetid pool below.“Mommy! Mommy!” she screamed, managing to hold on long enough for an older boy to run in and save her.Hundreds of parents, enraged that their warnings about the dilapidated school had been ignored for years, burst into protest a couple of days later, upending their quiet rural town for two weeks last August. They burned tires, blocked roads and demanded justice from the provincial government led by David Mabuza, a former maths teacher who had become one of the most powerful figures in the African National Congress (ANC) and was positioning himself to become South Africa’s deputy president.One of the party’s historic promises had been to provide a good education for black people, who had been deliberately denied the opportunity under apartheid. ANC leaders like Nelson Mandela often spoke about freeing black South Africans through school\u0026nbspand Mabuza, whose first big post in the province was education minister, got his political start by promising just that.But under the ANC the education system has been a\u0026nbspshambles, so gutted by corruption that even party officials are dismayed at how little students are learning, in schools so decrepit that children have plunged to their deaths in pit toilets.The rage in Ziyanda’s town grew so intense that protesters hurled stones at a local ANC leader, who narrowly escaped by whipping out his handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd, wounding two children and roiling the community all the more.Mabuza never came to the school or met with the parents –\u0026nbspand for good reason, local officials contend. The dangerous conditions were a clear reflection of his control over the province, where millions of dollars for education have disappeared into a vortex of suspicious spending, shoddy public construction and brazen corruption to fuel his political ambitions, according to government records and officials in his party.But the uprising and allegations against Mabuza did not crimp his political rise. To the contrary, only a few months later, as the ANC tried to quash national outrage over misrule by its leaders, Mabuza scored his biggest triumph by far. He was picked to become second-in-command of the entire ANC, launching him into an even more prominent post\u0026nbspas South Africa’s deputy president, second only to the nation’s leader.Mabuza may seem an odd choice, especially at a time when the ANC is desperate to purge its reputation for graft and restore its image as the rightful heir to Mandela’s legacy. After all, Mabuza’s rural province, Mpumalanga, is fairly small, has little economic clout and is widely regarded as one of the country’s most corrupt.But that is the vexing secret behind Mabuza’s spectacular climb, current and former ANC officials say: he siphoned off money from schools and other public services to buy loyalty and amass enormous power, making him impossible to ignore on the national stage and putting him in position to shape South Africa for years to come.Mabuza (second right) (AFPGetty)“He didn’t become what he is now because of his political capability,” says\u0026nbspFish Mahlalela, a senior ANC figure in the province and a national lawmaker.“No, no, it was out of money and\u0026nbspmanipulation,” he adds. “Nothing else.”Perhaps more than any other member of South Africa’s new government, Mabuza undercuts the promise of a “new dawn” in the country after the removal of President Jacob Zuma this year.Besieged by scandals that have hacked away at the ANC’s legitimacy and electoral prospects, the party installed a new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in February. From the start, he pledged to root out corruption and finally deliver on the promise of a just South Africa for all of its citizens.But to seal his new post, Ramaphosa first had to secure the backing of Mabuza, 57, who built such a formidable political machine that he became kingmaker in the back-room negotiations to choose South Africa’s new president. After campaigning for a rival, Mabuza abruptly switched sides and joined forces with Ramaphosa, helping the two emerge from a pivotal party conference last December as the country’s undisputed leaders.Then, to the surprise of many in his province, Mabuza gave a speech just weeks after being sworn in as deputy president this year, lamenting the poor state of the schools and the “tragedies that take away the innocence of our children”. He spoke movingly of a kindergartner electrocuted at school. Of a toddler who drowned after falling into a broken pit latrine. And of a five-year-old boy whose body was discovered by his mother at the bottom of another dilapidated pit, his hand sticking out of a pool of faeces.Such deplorable conditions were all too common, he noted, symbolising the failure to provide black South Africans with a decent chance at life.“Where is our care?” Mabuza said in the speech. “What has gone wrong with our nation?”Yet under Mabuza’s leadership, millions of dollars for schools in his province have been misspent year after year, according to the national government. His province routinely spent less on poor students than required\u0026nbspand school construction projects have been riddled with inflated costs, government records show.Nearly a quarter of the primary schools in Mabuza’s province still have only dilapidated pit toilets, despite ample government funds to fix them. And during his tenure, his province was caught fabricating the passing rates on the annual national exam, enabling him to claim big leaps forward that never happened.The schools Mabuza did champion provided an easy way to funnel large amounts of money into politics, according to ANC officials, high-ranking defectors and anti-corruption groups. He pushed to build big boarding schools whose costs tripled\u0026nbspfor unexplained reasons\u0026nbspto $30m (£23m) each, alarming education experts. Some construction was so shoddy that roofs sprouted leaks soon after being finished, toilets barely worked, students lacked water, retaining walls collapsed and dormitories were missing doors, according to a provincial report.Over the years, Mabuza’s province also became known as one of South Africa’s most dangerous. Nearly 20 politicians, most from inside the ANC, were assassinated in the past two decades, some after exposing graft in public works projects.All the while\u0026nbspMabuza’s political career flourished. He attracted legions of new ANC members with government contracts, cash handouts and even KFC meals, according to current and former party officials.His sweeping recruitment drive turned his relatively insignificant province into the ANC’s second biggest voting bloc. Under the party’s delegate system, his territory became more influential than even Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria\u0026nbspwith a population three times the size and an economy nearly five times as big.Now, critics contend, Mabuza’s role as the country’s second most powerful politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of the new government and its assertions that the ANC is turning the page on corruption.Under the ANC, Mandela’s once-heralded liberation movement, tens of billions of dollars meant to lift poor black South Africans have been stolen by party leaders. Strong institutions like the tax agency have been hollowed out by party officials bent on shielding their illicit activities.But the nation’s poor schools are perhaps the ANC’s greatest betrayal of the dreams of black South Africans – some of whom have turned to burning down such institutions in protest.Mabuza, who declined to be interviewed, built his political career on the schools. Unlike other, more celebrated anti-apartheid leaders, he did not go into exile he was not imprisoned on the infamous Robben Island. Instead, he fought for the right of black South Africans to receive an equal education, a call he echoed in his recent speech.As many South Africans pin their hopes on Ramaphosa’s pledge for a fresh start, analysts say that much of the country is looking past an unpleasant truth: the new president owes his victory in part to corruption, and much of his administration’s future – as well as the country’s – rests in the hands of Mabuza.“If there is any powerful person whom Ramaphosa’s presidency actually relies on, it is Mabuza,” says\u0026nbspRalph Mathekga, the author of Ramaphosa’s Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?“We are being reluctant as a nation to face the reality of Mabuza,” he adds. “If Ramaphosa gets hit by a bus, Mabuza is going to be the president.”Scandal from the startThe numbers just didn’t add up, even at the beginning.After apartheid ended in 1994, Mabuza got his first big break: he became Mpumalanga’s education minister, a chance to shape the schools and generations of students attending them.He had the perfect resume. The son of farmers, Mabuza grew up here in the province, walking miles from his village to the only primary school in a nearby town. Though he often had no shoes, he always tucked in his shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, recalls\u0026nbspReginah Mhaule, a childhood peer.“He was never late,” says\u0026nbspMhaule, a longtime ally who recently became one of South Africa’s two deputy foreign ministers.A bright student, Mabuza ultimately took one of the few jobs available to black South Africans back then. He taught maths at the local high school and later became a founding leader of a teachers’ association.Poor schooling was a major spark in the anti-apartheid movement, most notably in Soweto in 1976, when thousands of students protested the introduction of Afrikaans as the language of instruction. In Mabuza’s province, teachers and students began organising against white minority rule in the early 1980s.The teachers were at the centre\u0026nbspof the movement, says\u0026nbspSandile Sukati, a teacher who recruited Mabuza into the main student organisation. Mabuza quickly stood out, he says, travelling far and wide to build ties among anti-apartheid groups.Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)“He was a leader in his own right,” Sukati says.But after apartheid ended, Mabuza quickly ran into trouble, leading to the province’s first big scandal of the democratic era.\u0026nbspIn 1997, three years into his tenure as education minister, the schools were performing poorly, especially on the national obsession: the annual matriculation exams that determine whether students graduate from high school. The passing rate in his province was 46 per cent that year, slightly below the national average.Mabuza was feeling the pressure, particularly as powerful ANC leaders returned from exile, often with military credentials that overshadowed his own, several current and former ANC officials say.Sukati, who worked under Mabuza at the education department, recalls Mabuza\u0026nbsptelling some of the teachers: “I am in a tight situation.”\u0026nbspThe next year brought a stunning improvement. The passing rate inexplicably jumped to 72 per cent – an incredible turnaround that catapulted Mpumalanga to second place\u0026nbspamong the nation’s nine provinces.“I was suspicious,” says\u0026nbspSukati, who is now a senior education official. “It couldn’t just happen like that.”A whistleblower exposed the cheating a few weeks later. The real passing rate, authorities announced, was under 53 per cent. Moreover, the doctoring had taken place inside Mabuza’s residence, where he met with a small circle of bureaucrats, some of whom were later fired.An investigation was never completed. Mabuza never admitted wrongdoing or suffered any significant consequences. Dropped as education minister, he was named head of housing instead.Ever since, Mabuza’s career has been remembered for that scandal, one that helped establish the kind of culture of impunity in his province that has tarnished the ANC across South Africa..“I think\u0026nbspthe man, he had to be charged, but unfortunately I don’t know what went wrong,” says\u0026nbspRonnie Malomane, an ANC official who was taught maths by Mabuza in the early 1980s. “They were just giving him position after position.”Nationally, Mabuza’s standing kept rising, propelled by his success at attracting new party members. In 2009, Zuma appointed him premier of all of Mpumalanga province.But Mabuza raised more red flags, stripping some of the decision-making power over government projects from local officials and concentrating it in his own office. He justified the move – called the “Rapid Implementation Unit” – as a way to act quickly. Others had a different explanation.“That’s how he managed to loot,” says\u0026nbspCollen Sedibe, a former ANC leader who grew up on the same street as Mabuza and worked under him in the provincial housing department.Treasury officials in the province say they are now investigating the irregular expenditures “incurred through the contracts arranged centrally by the Office of the Premier”.But parents, officials and educators had warned about the damage from corruption and neglect for years, pointing to the painfully overcrowded classrooms and decaying, apartheid-era schools.‘They wanted to kill me’It took four days of rage before the local ANC councillor showed up.The councillor, Justice Twelve Siboza, explained that he had been busy the week Ziyanda fell into the toilet, tending to another corner of his ward. Other activities had also drawn his attention: he is a gospel singer with his own radio show, so he crisscrosses the region to perform at weddings and funerals.By the time he got to Ziyanda’s school, hundreds of parents had closed off the unpaved roads, furious that their grievances had been met with near silence from the ANC’s leaders.Siboza made sure to bring a gun. Politics is dangerous in South Africa, sometimes lethal, he says.The ANC has a grip on the area around the school because most residents, aside from the lucky few working at the sugar cane plant, are poor and rely on the party for government jobs, contracts or monthly welfare grants.It is an area Mabuza knows well. He began his ascent inside the ANC as the head of this part of the province. It was once part of a homeland set aside for black people by the apartheid government. To this day, several ANC officials say, Mabuza has kept a hold on it through powerful proxies.Some see a deep cynicism behind the conditions in the schools. When black South Africans become educated and move into the middle class, their loyalty to the party tends to wane, recent elections have shown. So by perpetuating a culture of dependence, critics contend, the ANC ensures its dominance.But Mhaule, the childhood peer of Mabuza, rejects\u0026nbspany suggestion that the ANC had failed to prioritise education.Officials like Mhaule say the rising pass rate on the national high school exam provides clear evidence of progress. But the figures can be misleading. The number of students taking the exam has declined in the past two years. Weaker students who would drag down the rate are being held back, education experts say.About 600 protesters gathered at the school that cold Friday morning when Siboza, the local ANC councillor, arrived with a police escort. As he moved to talk to the parents, demonstrators showered him with rocks.“They wanted to kill me,” the councillor says.Siboza made a run for it, reaching for the hip holster under his brown overcoat. He took out his gun – firing three times and hitting two teenagers, a girl and a boy.Agreement Mashele, the school board chairman, was shocked. “This man is a church member,” he says.A few days later, the ANC councillor visited the children he had wounded.“The councillor said he was very sorry,” says\u0026nbspthe girl, Siphesihle Ngobeni, whose left leg was grazed by a bullet. The councillor pleaded with her not to press charges and gave her about $15, she says. She used the money to buy sanitary pads.The boy’s injury was more severe. His father, Petros Thobela, who had gone to the same primary school and did not have a job, accepted a similar apology and compensation of, according to the councillor, about $150.The boy’s mother, Nobuhle Ndlovu, who does odd jobs, deplores\u0026nbspthe state of education.“They promise,” she says, “and they just disappear.”Still, she would remain loyal to the governing party.“Yes, of course, I vote ANC,” she says. “It’s our freedom.”‘He always had money in his house’The protests spilled into September, but the country’s attention was fixed on another battle: the national push to replace Zuma as South Africa’s president.The all-important ANC party election was only a few months away, and officials in Mabuza’s province were bracing to see whether his years of hard work had paid off.In early October, the ANC released the delegate breakdown, with good news for Mabuza: his previously low-ranking province was now the ANC’s second most powerful.Mabuza owed his outsize influence to a single feat. In the past decade, ANC membership in his province had skyrocketed nearly 190 per cent, eclipsing the national increase of less than 60 per cent. No other province came close to matching Mpumalanga’s explosive growth.But Mabuza’s numbers were as cooked as his high school passing rates, current and former ANC officials contend.In South Africa, taxes are collected by the national government, which distributes the money to provinces. The provinces then use the money – with little oversight from above.Treasury officials in Mpumalanga say that “irregular expenditures” more than doubled in the previous two budget years, particularly in education, housing and health.Wages account for most of the education and health budgets. So money is usually siphoned off by politicians and business allies through contracts for services or construction, ANC officials say. When costs are suspiciously high, schools are poorly built or facilities are badly maintained, they say, it is often a warning that money is being skimmed, at the students’ expense.Thousands in Israel protest draft law that would ‘exclude’ ArabsGrenfell victims were subject to ‘social apartheid’, says Diane AbbottSouth Africa is the most unequal country in the world, says World BankMandela’s letters chart his heartbreaking struggle from behind barsAs premier, Mabuza promoted the construction of big boarding schools, or mega-schools, in farm areas to improve rural education. Since 2012, the province has completed five, with two more in the pipeline.For reasons that have not been explained, the price of each school has ballooned from $11m to around $30m.Asked whether Mabuza wanted the mega-schools to facilitate the theft of public funds, Mhaule, his former education minister, laughs\u0026nbspand says:\u0026nbsp“I don’t know.”But other officials say the mega-schools were overpriced projects to reward Mabuza’s allies and finance his ANC membership drive.Mabuza\u0026nbspwas sworn in as deputy president in February. “His passion,” reads his official biography, “still remains in education.”Minutes after the swearing-in, he faced questions about corruption and political killings in his province. “There’s nothing to set straight,” he told the national public broadcaster.“I’m here to serve South Africans,” he added. “Let’s give this government a chance.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/25/11/nicki-minaj-0.jpg","title":"nicki minaj margaret thatcher queen radio shout out queen","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027Everyone has to express their truth and I have to ruffle a few feathers along the way, I don’t care\u0027Click to followThe Independent CultureNicki\u0026nbspMinaj\u0026nbsphas caused a whirlwind of confusion on social media after giving a shout-out to Margaret Thatcher, the late former Prime Minister.\u0026nbsp“Everyone has to express their truth and I have to ruffle a few feathers along the way, I don’t care,” Minaj\u0026nbspsaid on her Queen Radio show.

While Nasa has described the asteroid as “potentially hazardous”, it\u0026nbspis expected to pass us by a distance of 3 million miles.The diameter of the Earth is about 8,000 miles. Any object that comes within 4.6 million miles of the planet comes under the “potentially hazardous” category.Other asteroids are actually expected to pass much closer to our planet in the coming days, although admittedly ones only measuring around 6m.Nasa have previously issued a statement saying that “no asteroid currently known is predicted to impact Earth for the next 100 years”.Are you

funding after no-deal BrexitBritain stands to lose around half a billion pounds of annual European science funding in the event of a no-deal Brexit, jeopardising research into cancer and other health treatments, new figures reveal.The UK receives €1.28bn (£1.15bn) every year from Horizon 2020, the EU’s funding programme for science and innovation.The nation would lose around 45 per cent of the cash, and its ability to influence key European projects, in a no-deal scenario, according to analysis by the Scientists for EU group.The government had previously attempted to reassure scientists by claiming they would still have access to EU funding under ‘third country’ rules, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.But following the publication this week of their plans for a no-deal Brexit, the government has updated advice to scientists to concede funding from the EU would be lost.\u0026nbsp“Third country participation does not extend to some Horizon 2020 calls”, the advice now reads.That line\u0026nbspupdated a report published at the beginning of August which said: “In a no-deal scenario, UK researchers and businesses would be able to apply to, and participate in all those Horizon 2020 calls open to third country participants from the date of exit.”Without full membership of Horizon 2020, the UK would lose access to money from the European Research Council (ERC), Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) and SME Instrument grants, which are not available to “third countries”.The revelation comes after leading scientists voiced concerns about a chaotic exit from the EU and declared their support for The Independent’s Final Say campaign, calling for a referendum on the final Brexit deal.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor

participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchThe highly prestigious ERC and MSCA make up the biggest chunk of funding from the EU, and losing them would be a major hit to the UK’s scientific community.Professor Lisa Bortolotti, of the University of Birmingham, and whose mental health research s psychology, psychiatry and philosophy, said\u0026nbspthat without the\u0026nbspprogrammes, “projects like mine could not be pursued in the UK”.“Losing ERC funding is mad,” she added.Olivier Stephan, who coordinates grants at the Francis Crick Institute, said the ERC drives some of the country’s most important science, citing its work fighting cancer.While, he said, the institute was\u0026nbspworking on the basis ongoing grants are safe, there are fears for the future of British scientists and the country’s ability to attract foreign talent.On top of a hit to UK science, the SME Instrument programme provides £143 million to small, innovative UK businesses, funding around 17 per cent of their research and development.The government has said it will step in to replace any lost funding if necessary, but the effects of third country status go deeper than monetary value, according to some experts. \u0026nbsp“Throughout my career I have had many, many grants, but none as transformational as the ERC grants,” said Professor Carlos Frenk, a cosmologist at Durham University. “Access to these grants to a very large extent determines where the very best researchers in the world want to go.”“In short, it’s a mess,” said Dr Mike Galsworthy, programme director at Scientists for EU.Besides the “chilling effect” the possibility of a no-deal Brexit is having on grant applications and hiring in the sector, he noted people who received EU grants were having to register with the government “just in case”.“So it’s devastation if it does happen, and just lesser damage, red tape and waste if it doesn’t,” he said.According to Scientists for EU, third country status would also mean UK researchers in European projects could no longer take leading roles, as the EU will not be willing to put them in charge of the money.\u0026nbspThat\u0026nbspis why Dame Anne Glover, president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, says it is essential the government arrives at some kind of deal.“If that doesn’t happen, there is a danger of us being a sort of lame duck, just looking at what the opportunities are and trying to become partners in research consortia without driving anything,” she said.The Tories’ plan for a no-deal Brexit is not looking so sunny any more‘Not realistic’ for UK to trade on WTO rules straight after BrexitDespite assurances, Dame Anne said she felt “we are really no further forward” with understanding the status of science after Brexit.“In March next year if there is no deal, the EU is not going to scrabble around to help researchers in the UK,” she said.“There may be an accommodation reached for a period of time, but there will be a hiatus, and research does not work well with a hiatus.”Professor Frenk added, unlike some of the predicted effects of a no-deal Brexit, the loss of scientific funds would not change the country overnight.“The effects won’t be seen tomorrow, they won’t be seen next year – they will be seen gradually over the years as we see a general decline in the scientific excellence of the UK,” he said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as

It’s a huge question.”Pressed on whether he believed the prime minister could get a deal through the chamber, he added: “I think it’s very unlikely she’ll get a deal through the House of Commons.”Lord Heseltine said that for months he has been saying there “had to be a second test of public opinion” either through a general election or a second EU referendum.“I think probably a referendum,” he said when asked which he would prefer. “It’s one or the other. Events will dictate which it is.”Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union While the prime minister has categorically ruled out a second referendum “under any circumstances”, Labour has left the option on the table should parliament reject Ms May’s agreement with the EU or if a no-deal Brexit is looming.On Friday, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor and one of Jeremy Corbyn’s closest allies,\u0026nbspsaid Labour would rule nothing out – echoing comments made by his frontbench colleague Sir Keir Starmer\u0026nbspthe previous day.Referring to Mr Johnson’s column in the Daily , in which the former foreign secretary said those wearing niqabs resembled “letterboxes” and “bank robbers”, Lord Heseltine\u0026nbspadded: “I think he should apologise.“My concern is the ripple effect. If people like him start using language that stimulates the worst elements of racism, it licences people to go further with impunity. ‘If Boris can say it, I can say it’. It becomes the sort of slogan of the racist element of the right wing.”He suggested there could only be two explanations for the contentious column that attracted widespread criticism. “One is that it’s a mistake and if it’s a mistake he could say so. The other is that he calculates it would advance his street cred with the right wing of the Tory party. And I think it’s possible he’s right with that judgement.”Asked whether he believed it was likely Mr Johnson would challenge the prime minister for leadership of the Conservative Party, Lord Heseltine added: “I think it’s much more likely that events will dictate the pace of change.“I would not expect him to make a decisive move – the move may be made inevitable by vacuums or by other people signing letters of no confidence, all these sorts of things, or by losses of votes in the House of Commons.“There has never been in my view such an unpredictable, calamitous set of events facing us.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/10/19/barry-gardiner.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/10/19/barry-gardiner.jpg","title":"labour brexit eu referendum john mcdonnell jeremy corbyn far right conservative","story":"Created with Sketch.Remarks from shadow chancellor come after a frontbench colleague said such a move would be undemocratic and could cause civil disobedienceClick to followIndy PoliticsLabour not taking new Brexit deal referendum off the table, John McDonnell saysLabour is not taking the option of a fresh EU referendum off the table, shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said, as he also warned about the potential of the far right in Britain to exploit the issue.The remarks from one of Jeremy Corbyn’s most senior allies came after the party’s Brexit spokesman made\u0026nbspsimilar comments but another cabinet colleague argued a second public vote could lead to civil disobedience and social disruption in the UK.Mr McDonnell also described the government’s release of 24 technical notes –\u0026nbspoutlining official preparations for a no-deal scenario –\u0026nbspas “extremely worrying” and said Labour will fight a disorderly Brexit.Labour says new Brexit referendum is possible if May’s deal rejectedNo-deal Brexit could disrupt delivery of foreign sperm to BritainDrug companies told to stockpile extra medicines for no-deal BrexitNationalism makes you weak, poor and morally insecure, EU warnsAppearing on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr McDonnell was asked to clarify Labour’s position on a second EU referendum after Sir Keir Starmer made clear the option is possible if parliament rejects Theresa May’s agreement with Brussels or if a no-deal exit is looming.The previous day, Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, said he opposed a fresh vote, suggesting it would undermine democracy and could result in “social disruption, perhaps civil disobedience”.Mr McDonnell said: “It’s not Labour Party policy to have another referendum, we respect the past referendum, but we recognise that when the government comes forward with its proposals –\u0026nbspif it does, I’m worried we might be in a no-deal situation –\u0026nbspbut when the government comes forward with its proposals, parliament will decide the next step.“My own view is as I’ve said consistently, the Labour Party is not opposed to any kind of democratic engagement –\u0026nbspI’d prefer a general election.”UK news in picturesBritish Secretary of State for International Trade, Liam Fox, attends a signing ceremony for memorandums of understanding between British and Chinese firms and institutions at the British ambassador\u0027s residence in BeijingNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe hugs her daughter Gabriella, in Iran.

Rhino species are critically endangered or vulnerable after decades of being targeted by poaching gangs, and around 300 pangolins are poached every day\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspon average one every five minutes.​WWF’s East Africa wildlife crime coordinator Drew McVey said: “This technique could be a game-changer, reducing the number of endangered animal parts finding their way into overseas markets like Southeast Asia.“Man’s best friend is a trafficker’s worst nightmare: dogs’ incredible sense of smell means they can sniff out even the tiniest amount in a 40ft container.“As organised criminal syndicates use ever more sophisticated methods to hide and transport illegal wildlife products, it is vital that we continue to evolve our efforts to disrupt the barbaric trade.”Mombasa is a favourite port with smugglers of illegal wildlife parts, drugs and weapons. A 2014 wildlife crime report found it was Africa’s most active ivory trafficking hub. Between 2009 and 2014 18,817kg of ivory was\u0026nbspseized there.Before the trial, dogs were used in searches at the port and in transit by being led from container to container.The African heat and high number of containers – at least 2,000 a day –\u0026nbspmade conditions for the animals incredibly hard, officials say. Containers had to be opened in the presence of staff from Kenya Revenue Authority, customs and Kenya police, along with either the owner or a representative.\u0026nbspThe new technology, known as Rasco (Remote Air Sampling for Canine Olfaction), makes searches faster for both officers and dogs and eliminates red tape. The sniffing process can be done in climate-controlled rooms, allowing many more containers to be checked.Wildlife Photographer of the Year People’s Choice award18 Winner – Pikin and AppolinairePikin, a lowland gorilla, had been captured and was going to be sold for bushmeat but was rescued by Ape Action Africa.

Initially\u0026nbspthe Russian Justice Ministry’s moves against the group appeared to be\u0026nbspa response to an aggressive leafleting campaign.\u0026nbspSome have suggested the group’s opposition to overt patriotism and violence played a role.

Most of an\u0026nbspestimated 175,000 members of the denomination\u0026nbspin Russia no longer advertise their faith.

While shared widely on social media over the past day, it appears to have been recorded in the run-up to the 2016 Brexit referendum.The Irish border, which zig-zags for more than 300 miles across the north-east of Ireland and is crossed by 200 public roads, has been the biggest issue facing Britain as it leaves the EU.During the Troubles, the period of civil unrest in Ireland during the late-20th century, major border crossings were blocked by British Army checkpoints, with some smaller routes closed completely.Fears of a return to a hard border and a return to bloodshed have grown since England and Wales voted to leave the EU in June 2016.

But that’s where we have got it so wrong.It comes as no surprise that nearly 50 per cent of UK schools are failing to achieve the target 25 per cent of A-level entries in STEM subjects — science, technology, engineering and mathematics.The nation is crying out for STEM skills. It is estimated there is a STEM-worker shortfall of 40,000 — and it is set to rise. We are facing a national crisis.Yet schools are rewarded on delivering grades, not different subjects. And this relentless focus on grades means youngsters are potentially being deprived access to high-paid and fast-growing careers.Research shows interest in maths and science dramatically declines during secondary school.When it comes to gender, there is a big difference. Interest in STEM subjects drops by 56 per cent among boys and 74 per cent among girls.Quite often girls underestimate their performance and, although they get better grades in maths and physics at GCSE, fewer of them take the subjects at A level than boys.There is this perception that you have to be a genius to do maths or science, but that is not true.Often teachers will say unless you get a grade A in maths or science at GCSE, don’t even bother taking it for A level. The reality is, even if you get a lower grade in the subject, it is still viewed very well by employers. Even if you take just one STEM subject, it will open up so many more doors.This is one of the reasons I created Future Finder, a free app to show young people the relationship between subject choices and their career pathway.After all, this is about preparing them for a job, not getting them to the top of the school system.Science is also fun, it is creative. It’s not dull and nerdy, which is how it is often perceived.We need to tell youngsters there are such jobs as autonomous vehicle engineers, gamification designers and carbon capture technicians, because you can’t be what you can’t see.Sixty-five per cent of children entering primary school now will end up working in jobs that don’t yet exist. And unless young people are learning the right skills, they’re not going to get them.Nearly 30 years ago, when I set up a data analysis company with my husband Clive, people threw data away because it was too expensive to keep. We went on to create Tesco Clubcard, the world’s first supermarket loyalty card.We were only a small business, but we had the skills to figure out something Tesco couldn’t on its own — exactly what its customers were buying.It revolutionised the way we shop, the supermarket doubled its market share within the year and we went from employing 30 staff to 1,500.We were at the forefront of a new science and it was an amazing time.I’m incredibly lucky and I’ve had a brilliant career. Now I want to help give back by preparing tomorrow’s talent.I was the chair of Your Life, a national campaign to encourage youngsters to consider careers in STEM.As a result of that movement, the Government now gives schools an additional £600 per pupil studying maths at A level.Figures also show that STEM subjects are becoming more popular. More than a third of all A-level entries in 2018 were in these subjects and more girls are taking STEM subjects.But we are already far behind countries such as America and China. That gap is only going to get wider too, as we estimate we will need 1.3million more science professionals by 2030.If schools are the talent factory then we need to deliver the skills the nation needs. We must start by giving extra weighting to maths and physics when it comes to measuring a school’s success.We are defined by the talent coming through our schools. That’s our future, that’s who we will be.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Quite the reverse. The vast majority come for a better life and a decent job and integrate perfectly.Our objection is to short-sighted politicians who failed to foresee the cost.Now wages are depressed, houses and rents unaffordable, schools overcrowded, the NHS and our transport system under massive strain.Migrant numbers should be tied to our economic need — but it is vital, with the annual net increase still at 280,000, that we build the infrastructure to match.What’s being done? Precious little.WHAT credibility can Labour’s promises over the freedom of the media possibly have when their single biggest financial backer is the odious Max Mosley?Leave aside that he is a former fascist who was present as his father Oswald’s thugs marched through a Jewish area of East London chanting “Jews out”.He now bankrolls Corbyn’s mob, to the tune of £300,000 last year alone, because he knows they will try to crush the popular Press given the chance. His apparent sole motivation being revenge after his lust for Germanic sado-masochistic hooker orgies was exposed.This, then, is the rancid state of Labour:A cesspit of a party, run by public schoolboy Marxist class warriors, infested with anti-Semitic racism and funded by one of the most unimaginably unpleasant individuals in public life.How proud its MPs must be.IT’S far too easy for banks to blame ­customers conned out of their savings.Most of us are still too savvy to give our details to cold-callers or emailers.

Corbyn’s speech was full of cuddly sounding expressions.But the real message was clear: Never mind all that freedom nonsense — let’s nationalise the news.So, the Labour leader says he wants to invest taxes in public-interest journalism.Who would want journalism that goes against the public good?But the question is: Who decides what the public interest might mean?Government ministers? High court judges? Simon Cowell and Cheryl? Jeremy Corbyn’s press office?Look a little closer and it is clear there is no consensus on what qualifies as public-interest journalism.It is just an ethical-sounding excuse for imposing your own interests on what are really matters of personal taste and political preference.One thing seems certain: It will not be the British public deciding which sort of public-interest journalism taxes should finance.Corbyn wants his state-backed media fund to be “independent”.A buzzword that should raise the question: Independent of what?There are no independent angels floating above the grubby political battles below, with only the public interest at heart.Everybody has interests and agendas of their own.Labour’s independent media funding body would be another government-backed quango, stacked with placemen from the political and cultural elites.Corbyn had the nerve to protest that the media today is “unaccountable”.Yet his independent media board would be less accountable to the public than newspapers, which must respond to their readers who pay their hard-earned money for their newspaper of choice.As for taxes funding journalism to create a more informed public — informed by who, peddling which line?It is not hard to imagine the sort of information Corbyn wants the media to feed us, it would be like the old Russian Communist party paper Pravda.It is no coincidence that the Labour Party’s biggest individual donor last year was the odious, Press-hating Max Mosley.The Labour leader singled out something called the Bureau Of Investigative Journalism as an example of an independent outfit that should be given charitable status and tax perks.Would that be the same self-righteous bureau that prompted the BBC’s flagship Newsnight programme to throw its ethics overboard a few years ago and falsely inform us that a Tory lord was a paedophile?Newsnight never recovered its reputation in the wake of the debacle.When Corbynites talk about wanting a more “diverse” media, one thing they do not mean is diversity of content and opinion. They want a conformist media that will report what it is told and not ask awkward questions.Even the BBC — bastion of the Remainstream media establishment — is too insolent for Labour’s tastes.If you want to see the real face of Labour’s attitude to journalism, just look at Corbyn’s smirking response to a Sky News reporter who asked him some straight questions about the recent wreath-laying controversy.His contemptuous reply basically said, “You have no right to know what I do or think” — in which case, neither do the mass of viewers.Labour’s track record gives the lie to any notion that it is interested in a more open media.The non-Corbynite deputy leader, Tom Watson, is an even more embittered Press-hater.Who does Jeremy Corbyn think he is, to be laying down the law on what a free Press should or should not investigate, and protesting to regulators when they report facts or express opinions not to his liking?Yet Corbyn’s quasi-Stalinist vision of State-approved journalism seems to go down well with his cultish fan club, who ensured that #ChangeTheMedia was trending on Twitter even before he spoke in Edinburgh.Perhaps they should more honestly have made it #ChangeTheMedia-OrElse.“Just because it’s on the front page of The Sun or The Mail,” Corbyn claimed yesterday, “doesn’t automatically make it news.”If he had his way, it would be more a case of: “Just because it’s news, doesn’t automatically mean it should be allowed on the front page of The Sun.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Remainer sabotage? Or just another tone-deaf blunder?Either way, he left the Government looking even more chaotic than usual.Will No Deal happen? Consider this:Britain has offered “unconditional” security cooperation with the EU post-Brexit. In response, Brussels vows to CHARGE us to access its databases.They want capitulation, not a deal.JEREMY Corbyn’s sole motive in “changing the media” is to silence a hostile Press.The giveaway was when he attacked broadcasters yesterday for following up Sun stories. “Just because it’s on the front page of The Sun or Mail doesn’t automatically make it news,” he whined.Could this be because recent front pages have exposed Labour’s racism? That IS news, as page one stories in the two biggest daily papers tend to be.Britain already has the world’s most vibrant media. Corbyn is feigning some high-minded interest in improving it. But the last thing he wants is it holding a future Labour Government to account.He detests scrutiny, as his tantrums sparked by tricky questions prove.As for his plan for a state-run Facebook rival, can you imagine anything more ridiculous or pointless?The ­Austin Allegro of social media, making ­gargantuan losses for taxpayers?And how about his “Netflix levy” to fund the BBC?Is there no limit to the costs he wants to pile on ordinary people?NOW, by contrast, is the time for the Tories to CUT taxes.There is depressing talk of a new hike to fund the NHS. But the public finances are in unexpectedly good shape, the deficit plummeting and growth on the up.Corporation tax should be as low as Ireland’s, stamp duty slashed to get the housing market moving, fuel duty lowered, and income tax cut too.With No Deal Brexit more likely, we need to boost the economy and lure investment with a low-tax regime as never before.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has been engulfed by Treasury defeatism.Other Cabinet figures know that post-Brexit we will have the economic tools to thrive. If Mr Hammond wants to show he understands that too, and keep his job after next March, he should draw up a tax-cutting Budget now.Not just moan that the sky is falling in.“We need an upbeat, outward looking, asporicational chancellor who wants to embrace Brexit and all it has to offer, not someone who is permanently trying to stop it.“I think Sajid Javid would be a great Chancellor - I think he’s born to be Chancellor.”Another senior Tory said: “There isn’t a single person now in politics who in any way can understand why he’s still there because he’s undermined the Prime Minister on every single turn.“Everyone is astonished that he still exists, he still stays in that position and he seems to be taking a completely different line from her on every given occasion.”No10 also laid bare its frustration at Mr Hammond’s failure to get clearance from the Prime Minister before publishing the letter.A Downing Street source dismissed the analysis as “preliminary and very much a work in progress,” adding: “As we have always said, Britain will ultimately succeed, no matter what our particular relationship is with the EU.”But the PM’s deputy David Lidington defended the Chancellor’s divisive intervention.Mr Lidington claimed Mr Hammond was only trying to be punctual in replying to MPs.And he insisted it was a coincidence that the Chancellor’s letter - which warned a no deal Brexit could wipe ten per cent off Britain’s national income - was sent on the same day as Mr Raab’s long-awaited presentation of Britain’s contingency planning designed to kill off “scare stories”.GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250 or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Among the victims was Marie Collins, a prominent survivor who served on Francis advisory board but quit in frustration last year.She has since become a harsh critic of the Vatican, and occasionally the pope.On his arrival in Dublin this morning to begin the two-day visit he immediately spoke of his pain and shame at the churchs child abuse scandal.In the first papal visit to the country in almost 40 years, Pope Francis landed 10.26am on a direct flight from Rome.He is due to hold mass tomorrow with half a MILLION pilgrims expected to attend.But speaking first alongside Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar this afternoon, Francis said that public outrage against the failures of the church to protect children in its care was justified.In extraordinary comments addressing the scale of clerical sex abuse in Ireland, the pontiff said people were right to be angry at church figures over the repellent crimes inflicted on young people.He told an audience at Dublin Castle: With regard to the most vulnerable, I cannot fail to acknowledge the grave scandal caused in Ireland by the abuse of young people by members of the Church charged with responsibility for their protection and education.He added: The failure of ecclesiastical authorities - bishops, religious superiors, priests and others - adequately to address these repellent crimes has rightly given rise to outrage and remains a source of pain and shame for the Catholic community.I myself share those sentiments.But Francis said that the church now has a responsibility to make amends by redoubling efforts to provide care for the most vulnerable in society.He added: It is my hope that the gravity of the abuse scandals, which have cast light on the failings of many, will serve to emphasise the importance of the protection of minors and vulnerable adults on the part of society as a whole, he added.In this regard, all of us are aware of how urgent it is to provide our young people with wise guidance and sound values on their journey to maturity.The Pope said he also wished to acknowledge women who in the past had endured particularly difficult circumstances.On Northern Ireland, he praised those who helped forged the historic Good Friday Agreement in 1998.And he referenced the political deadlock in Northern Ireland, which has seen the region without a properly functioning devolved government for 20 months.Francis said: We can give thanks for the two decades of peace that followed this historic agreement, while expressing firm hope that the peace process will overcome every remaining obstacle and help give birth to a future of harmony, reconciliation and mutual trust.The speech came after a private meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, at which the Irish premier urged the Pope to listen to the victims.Earlier, he met Irish President Michael D Higgins at his official residence in Phoenix Park.Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to welcome Pope Francis during his whistle-stop tour of the capital city and Co Mayo over the weekend.The Pontiff will witness a country that has undergone seismic social changes in the four decades since the last papal visit in 1979, when John Paul II was lauded by a nation shaped by its relationship with an all-powerful Catholic Church.Senior Irish clerics and other dignitaries gathered on the apron of the runway to greet the Pope clapped as the Alitalia flight landed.Irish and Vatican flags were flown from the cockpit windows as the aircraft taxied toward its stand.Pope Francis emerged from the plane soon after, walking down the steps to be greeted on a red carpet by Irelands deputy premier and foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney.He was with his wife Ruth and their three daughters Jessica, Beth and Annalise. The children greeted him in Irish, English and Spanish.One of the girls then presented the Pope with a bouquet of flowers. The bouquet included thistles, yellow and white roses and green foliage.Francis is likely to receive a warm reception from the thousands of pilgrims who have travelled to be part of the occasion.However, he will also be met by protesters angry at how the church dealt with multiple clerical sex abuse scandals that have damaged trust in the religious institution and seriously weakened its influence on Irish society.Mr Coveney acknowledged that many people had mixed feelings about the visit.He said: I think its been difficult for many people, for victims, for Catholics and many of the clergy.But I hope and expect that this weekend will be a very powerful moment. He has a personality that can reach out to Irish people.The Pope was driven from the airport for a meeting with the Irish President at his residence in Dublins Phoenix Park.Francis was greeted by Mr Higgins and his wife Sabina at their home at Aras an Uachtarain.The Irish greeting party also included Irish government minister for children and youth affairs Katherine Zappone.An Irish Army band played the national anthems of Vatican City and Ireland during the arrival ceremony.Moving inside the property, the pontiff signed the visitors book before entering into a private meeting with Mr Higgins, which took place ahead of a tree planting ceremony.Earlier this week, the Pope wrote a 2,000-word letter to Catholics in which he condemned the crime of sexual abuse by priests and subsequent cover-ups.He demanded accountability in response to fresh revelations in Pennsylvania in the United States of decades of misconduct by clerics.Francis is ostensibly in Ireland to attend the World Meeting of Families (WMOF) - a major global church event focused on promoting family values.However, he will also fulfil a number of other engagements.With Ireland in the midst of a high-profile homelessness problem, the Pope will meet a number of impacted individuals and families at a centre run by a religious order.Tens of thousands of people are expected to line the streets of Dublin city centre on Saturday afternoon as he passes through in his famous Popemobile.On Sunday the Pope will fly west to Co Mayo where he will follow in the footsteps of John Paul II and take part in a religious service at a Holy shrine.He will then return to Dublin for the closing centrepiece of the WMOF event - an outdoor Mass in front of an expected congregation of half a million people."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004282124321.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"karren brady cbb dan osborne","story":"The “theme” of this year’s CBB is that all the celebrities in the house have been embroiled in a scandal of some sort.But I would argue “scandal” is not quite the right word for the events that led to Osborne losing his role on Towie.In November 2014, Osborne was questioned over assault allegations after a fight with his ex, Megan Tomlin, although he was released without charge.A few months later, an audio recording emerged — allegedly secretly taken by Megan in November 2014 at her home — of Osborne apparently making foul-mouthed threats to “knife” Megan if she met another man, and referring to her as his “property”.That was three years ago, in 2015, and he went on to issue a public apology.He lost his job on Towie and also some lucrative endorsements which, no doubt, led to some soul-searching on his part.When talking about the “scandal” before entering the CBB house he said: “I said something that I never ever meant, I’m embarrassed by it. It was a horrible time.”In light of his apology, some people might talk about rehabilitation. He’s said he’s sorry and he won’t do it again.People have to be given a ­second chance — right?Before I answer that, let me flag up a few other stories that caught my eye this week.There’s the tale of Sean Simmons, 28, a domestic abuser from Hull who waterboarded one of his ex-partners, tying her to a bath before covering her face with a towel and pouring cold water over her, saying: “This is what I do to people who lie. I’m going to make you tell the truth.”Later, he produced a knife and said he’d “have to kill her”.And Darren McKie, a 43-year-old police inspector who was jailed for life after strangling his wife Leanne, 39, at their home in Cheshire, then dumping her body in a lake.And Glyn Leedell, 39, who threatened to kill a woman with a kitchen knife within hours of meeting her in a Rotherham pub.Oh, and the news that Ian Stewart, 57, who was jailed for 34 years after smothering his wife, children’s author Helen Bailey, is being questioned over the death of his first wife, Diane Stewart, who died after collapsing in the garden of the couple’s home in Cambridgeshire.I could go on, but it’s too depressing.If you read the same stories you may have taken a moment to despair that the papers are full of similar stories every day — of women being killed, brutalised and attacked by the men who purport to love them.Or, you may have barely noticed because these stories are so ­commonplace.Of course, not all men who threaten to kill their partners go on to do so.But you can be sure that most of the women above had probably suffered years of traumatic intimidation and abuse before their partners actually acted on their threats.Meanwhile, those women were ­living in fear — that’s what these chumps get off on. They want to make their victim feel helpless and powerless.So, let’s talk about forgiveness and rehabilitation.Do I think people who really regret being a perpetrator of domestic violence deserve a second chance? Yes, I do.If someone is genuinely ­repentant about anything they’ve done wrong, you can’t refuse ­forgiveness forever.Do I think that Dan Osborne’s second chance should take the form of a public platform on which to rehabilitate his image and, no doubt, earn a pretty penny or two into the bargain?No, I really, really do not.Sure, it was three years ago and no, he didn’t actually go on to act on his threat to knife his ex.But by letting him into the CBB house, Channel Five are sending a strong message that domestic violence allegations are a trivial affair, not to be taken seriously.By welcoming him in, despite his “scandal”, they are normalising and turning a blind eye to the kind of behaviour that too often ruins — and sometimes ends — women’s lives.People on TV are role models. And to allow a man who has made verbal threats to kill his girlfriend to become a role model is irresponsible in the extreme.ITV recognised this when they decided to boot him off Towie.Channel Five should have done the same.SHIRLEY BALLAS has revealed she weighs herself every day in the run up to Strictly in order to get “telly ready”.You might think that sounds extreme but, believe me, the only way to get telly ready is to take very seriously the old adage that the screen adds a stone.I don’t exactly weigh myself before filming The Apprentice or Give It A Year but, in the three months leading up to filming, I always manage to lose – by hook or by crook – a stone.In fact we all do – Lord Sugar and Claude Littner are watching what they eat as well.Then, as soon as filming stops, we all immediately put the weight back on again as normal life resumes.And, let me tell you, it’s a lot harder to take it off than it is to put it on.I’M a big believer in benefits being available to people who need help because they can’t help themselves.But the story of Bangladeshi immigrant Abdul Jalil, a father of six who came to the UK in 1969, really makes a mockery of the system.Jalil, who is 64, hasn’t worked since 1988 for “health reasons”.But a probation officer found the only problem he had is a slightly tender right knee.In 2008, he exceeded the amount of cash that claimants are allowed to have when he was loaned £25,000 to buy his council house.He did not notify the Department for Work and Pensions and continued wrongly claiming more than £28,000 over the next eight years.He then lied to the DWP about his assets as he filled out his benefits review form in 2012.He had re-mortgaged his council flat in May that year for roughly £148,000 and given the money to his children so they could purchase their own properties keeping around £86,500 for himself.Then at court this week he was spared jail – in favour of community service and even had the cheek to say he would do it if it was “light work”.I know that some people need benefits to get back on their feet, and I’m proud to live in a country that provides that.But once a person is back up, they need to actually stand on their own two feet – rather than abusing the system that helped them.Like all benefit cheats, he should pay the money back or go to jail and never be allowed access to benefits again.AS taxpayers we give almost £14BILLION a year away in foreign aid of which almost £1billion goes to the EU, and this week the Government was threatening to withdraw our cash if there was no-deal Brexit.Why wait until Brexit? Just stop it now.We need this money to fix our own country – our NHS, our police forces, our schools, benefits and housing all need it desperately.And the worst part of all this is that we have to borrow the money to give it away.Our country has almost £2TRILLION of debt, which costs around £50billion a year to service in interest.Borrowing money to give it away, it’s the economics of the madhouse.I KNOW our prisons are full, but it beggars belief that Allan Williamson, 45, was let off with a two-year community order and 30 days rehabilitation.When police raided his flat in Hulme, Manchester, they found more than 600 images – including 68 films classed as Category A, the highest level of children being sexually abused.To be clear, the images showed children as young as seven being sexually abused by adults.Still, Judge Elizabeth Nicholls,  decided prison wasn’t necessary, saying Williamson had been “open and frank” with the police about his behaviour and because the man has allegedly taken “tentative steps to address these issues”.So the guy was in possession of 600 images including many of the worst kind of paedophilia – and he’s still in the community?Who in their right mind would want this guy in their community?I know the prisons are buckling, so let’s just build more – even if that includes sending prisoners out to sea in containers.When is the justice system going to start thinking about the victims as opposed to the perpetrators?I BET the boyfriend of Kay Longstaff – the air hostess who spent ten hours in the water after plunging from a cruise liner – is feeling a bit embarrassed.Longstaff was miraculously rescued ten hours after falling – or jumping – from the Norwegian Star, 60 miles off the Croatian coast last week.It’s not quite clear what happened beforehand but other passengers and crew claim to have seen Ms Longstaff in several arguments with her partner Craig Rayment, above with Kay, on the evening of the incident.Once she’d been rescued, Mr Rayment’s estranged wife Kelly offered Ms Longstaff some unsolicited support, saying: “If I was on a ship with him, I would get off any way I could.”Oh dear.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Her cash had not arrived. The Venezuela economy is in freefall and hyperinflation has brought the country to its knees.Speaking out to The Sun on Sunday, the 68-year-old tore into the failing socialist policies Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wants to imitate.She said: “I have lived here all of my life and we have never had it so bad. This is a disaster.“I don’t have anything. I should get my pension and my disability payment for my spinal condition.“I just want to get a coffee or something to take away the hunger. I can’t remember when the last time was I had a proper meal.”Asked why she does not spend the folded 100 bolivar banknotes that form a sad tiara around her forehead, the former maid replies: “This money is worthless now because of inflation.“Five years ago 100 bolivars would have been enough to fill my fridge. Today the shops won’t take them as they are worth so little.“If Jeremy Corbyn thinks this is how to run a country he should come to see this place for himself.”The socialist nation of Venezuela is on the verge of collapse with inflation at 82,700 per cent and as thousands of malnourished citizens continued to flee across the border.Experts warn that inflation is set to hit one million per cent by the end of the year.A single chicken cost 15million bolivars in the old currency and the local version of the game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire has been cancelled as the top prize of two million bolivar — 13p — was not enough to buy a loaf bread.The economy has shrunk by 50 per cent since dictator Nicolas Maduro took power in 2013 and crime is rocketing as people do whatever it takes to feed their families.Corbyn and his allies have repeatedly praised the socialist experiment that has transformed Venezuela from one of the wealthiest countries in South America to a bankrupt state with £39billion in debts.In 2014, the 69-year-old Labour leader, then just an MP, phoned human rights abuser Maduro to discuss the “fight against capitalism” during a television interview.He went on to express his admiration for his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, and ended the call by saying: “Congratulations to you, Mr President.”Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said at the World Economics Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this year that the country’s problems were because it took a “wrong turn” and wasn’t socialist enough.Today, in the Venezuelan capital Caracas, it is hard to find people who share his enthusiasm for a regime that caused food shortages and forced the poorest to scavenge.Unemployed surveyor Antonio Cardenas, 64, saw his son Goram, 20, shot dead by muggers three years ago.Sadly his story is all too familiar in a place where wearing gold or openly using a mobile is “suicidal” on the lawless streets where 73 murders take place every day. Antonio said: “People are scared to criticise this government but the fact is this system does not work.“My son was killed because the criminals were desperate for his money. They shot him in his back.”President Maduro has blamed the crisis on his capitalist enemies and promised an “economic miracle” that will turn things around.This week Maduro, a former bus driver, created a new currency called the sovereign bolivar that has taken five zeros off the value of the old one, devaluing it by 96 per cent.But the new money has only added to the confusion as shops struggle to figure out how to value their goods.And with prices rising every minute, the old bills are still being traded alongside the new ones, sparking chaos in a country where power outages often cause the debit card network to freeze.Meanwhile, we found that the president’s promise of raising the minimum wage by 3,000 per cent had yet to be passed on to staff.Security guard Francisco Bonilla, 41, earns the equivalent of £7.81 a month as £1 is currently worth 12,878 of the new Bolivar currency and about 12million in the old.Queuing outside an ATM, he said: “I earn just over 100,000 in the new currency, it’s not enough to feed my wife and three children. We try to live off beans and cheese.“The government says it is raising my wages but my boss has told me he needs to wait and see what is going to happen. I’m very worried.”Violent protests shook the country last year and an audacious attempt to assassinate Maduro was made this month when drones fired rockets at him as he gave a speech.The president has responded by rounding up ­dissidents and clamping down on the foreign press.Our reporter and photographer filed this despite the constant risk of arrest for doing simple things like exposing empty supermarket shelves caused by food shortages.Meanwhile, ugly breeze block buildings, built by the socialists are covered in anti-government graffiti with “hungry” and “freedom” scrawled on the crumbling masonry.Just 20 years ago, when Chavez was elected president in 1998, oil-rich Venezuela was flush with money that allowed him to pump funds into public services.Today, while subsidised oil means that a tank of gas costs pennies and the roads are clogged with diesel spewing old cars, socialist policies have hampered businesses and stopped foreign investment.Many rely on the black market to survive.Women turn to prostitution in neighbouring countries, others smuggle petrol across the border to sell to foreigners. At night the capital becomes eerily dark because there are rolling power cuts.Pensioner Samuel Silva, 81, says he cannot find the medicine for the serious blood condition his wife Hilda Reyes, 78, needs to stay alive as the hospitals in this socialist utopia are so short of essentials.He said: “My parents moved here from Columbia when I was 12 years old because they wanted a better life. Today it is a mess.“If people in Britain elect Jeremy Corbyn to be Prime Minister, my message to them is that they had better get used to being hungry.“Socialism is a great system, unless you like to eat.”GOT a story?

with this and accepted, regardless of the fact I have never fiddled my expenses or taken cash for ­questions, some of those who come before me have damned all politicians to the sin-bin.I do, however, think there is one very simple thing all politicians could agree to do that would help rehabilitate us to the public.We could answer a straight question with a straight answer.This week doing the rounds on Twitter was a clip of Jeremy Corbyn on Channel 4 News being asked six times: “Do you honestly believe Britain will be better off outside of the EU?”Each time he answered with a variation of, “Labour wants to maintain good relations with the EU to protect jobs”.His words are not bad — it is certainly the answer he and his team would have practised.But it is not an answer to that question and that’s the problem.To the average punter it just looks like politicians can’t be straight.The answer, as far as I’m concerned, is a big fat no.Gavin Williamson, the Defence Secretary, suffered a similar cringeworthy encounter with Richard Madeley in May.The question in the wake of the Salisbury poisonings was: “You told Russia to ‘shut up and go away’.Do you regret that now?Do you think it was too informal?”He started by answering an entirely different question about paying tribute to healthcare workers, which had absolutely nothing to do with what he was being asked.God only knows why he didn’t just say: “Yeah, it wasn’t my finest hour but I guess I was just really cross that people in Britain were being poisoned.”He could then have gone on to say all the nice things about Salisbury health workers.Instead, Madeley savaged him and all that anyone remembers of the encounter is that Gavin Williamson should avoid interviews.Mind you, at least both Corbyn and Williamson gave an answer.At least they bothered to take part.Boris Johnson would just have offered his questioner a cup of tea as if he was Mrs Doyle from Father Ted.I honestly despair.I’m not sure when the art of just repeating the same message over and over again, even if it in no way answers the question, started.Most people put it down to the Tony Blair years of slick media management, but times have surely got to move on.Politicians spend too much time hedging their bets, trying to keep all the people happy and end up pleasing no one by waffling through an answer that is basically six of one and half a dozen of the other.I get that it is hard when your job is basically a massive popularity contest, but I am not sure we are made more popular by dodging questions and refusing to give our own opinions.People contact me every single week telling me they don’t always agree with me but they appreciate that I stand up for what I believe.I honestly don’t think the British people want politicians to say an approximation of a safe answer, or to try to be pals with everyone.People have a damn sight more respect for people when they say what they think, even if they disagree.For too long politicians have been especially scared of upsetting working-class people, without recognising that most people don’t even think of themselves that way any more.I have absolutely no idea where the idea came from that the average member of the public can’t stand a bit of discussion and disagreement, or are so fragile that they will all fall apart if someone says something not to their liking.I have never once voted for someone who I agreed with 100 per cent of the time.I didn’t marry someone I agreed with a 100 per cent of the time and, frankly, if he tried to please me, placate me and pander to all my views I would no longer stay married to him, because it would be dishonest.Don’t get me wrong — saying what you think is not a universally appreciated characteristic and some do get in touch with me to tell me to shut up and go away.Much like Russia probably felt when Williamson said it to them, I pay little mind to this and crack on.Journalists do sometimes ask stupid questions.Politicians do have to be careful about what they say as it can sometimes get twisted and misrepresented.Things are not always simple, and giving a quick answer on a complex issue takes some skill.All that said, it has got to be time to stop the waffle and give the public a break from shouting at their telly each night: “For God’s sake, answer the bleedin’ question!”IT’S that time of year where slow news weeks turn to how much wine we should drink and if swearing at work should be banned.Apparently no amount of alcohol is safe, which will change absolutely no one’s behaviour, and swearing at work is bad for morale.I cannot agree on the swearing front.I am not advocating we all run around barking sweary orders and aggressive expletives at our colleagues but I find sometimes, especially in times of high stress in the office, nothing will quite explain it like a collective FFS.I have seen how a bit of good old Anglo Saxon can be used to break down barriers between me and my constituents.It stops me seeming like some lofty bureaucrat who cannot understand their problems.In some cases it makes them physically relax if we get a bit sweary about their crappy landlord or their benefits being stopped.We all swear, and most of us drink, I doubt that’s going to change.PADDY DOHERTY of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding and Celeb Big Brother fame was in the papers this week, leading the funeral procession for his nephew.A sad affair, of course, but the diamond-encrusted funeral casket is reported to have cost £100,000.I remember organising my own mother’s funeral and balking at spending around £2,500 for an event I’d rather have not had to attend.I could hear her voice in my head saying, “How much?” as we wrote out cheques for cars and coffins. My wedding only cost £3k and I thought that was a bit much.When my time comes, I implore my family to keep their cash. I wouldn’t be thankful for money being literally burnt.THIS week’s, in fact this year’s, feminist icon goes to the unlikely Stormy Daniels.There is, of course, no reason why feminism would not extend to women performing in pornography but there are few crossovers.Stormy Daniels is a hero.World leaders across the globe pander to Trump, few are brave enough to publicly call out his racism, sexism and terrible decision making.Our own PM holds his hand, allowing him to make her look weak and feeble.Ms Daniels has been brave enough not only to take on the most powerful man in the world but also some pretty tooled-up lawyers too.After apparently receiving payment and signing a non-disclosure agreement to hush her up about an affair she had with Trump in 2006, she broke rank.This was not just a kiss and tell, this was a story that has caused Donald Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen to plead guilty to breaking election campaign rules.He explicitly stated that he was told to pay her the money by “the candidate” meaning Trump. Donald Trump will probably get away with this misdemeanour, but it is the closest he has come to being in real trouble.Without Stormy Daniels and her courage to face down legal threats, vicious hate mail and a campaign to discredit her, powerful men would continue to use women as playthings and just pay them off when they are done.Stormy Daniels is every woman who has been messed about and we salute her for fighting back.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We thought it was food poisoning, but no one really knows the truth.”The Coopers, of Burnley — where Susan was a Thomas Cook employee — were with daughter Kelly Ormerod and her three kids when they died.Kelly, 40, watched her “fit and healthy” parents die in front of her.But Aqua Magic general manager Dieter Geigerat said there was no evidence to support an illness spate.He added: “The doctor’s preliminary report indicates that death was due to natural causes.”A friend of the Coopers said: “The Egyptians seem to have come up with some nonsense that John had a heart attack and Susan keeled over from shock.But they were as fit as fiddles.”One holidaymaker claimed a rep said the couple died from carbon monoxide.But Egypt’s top prosecutor dismissed the claims of poisonous gas emissions in their room.GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250 or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Project Fear forecast dramatic downturns in the economy if the people were so unwise as to vote for Brexit. Wrong again.Since then, we have had record levels of employment, huge investments from the likes of Google, Microsoft, SoftBank and a long list of other companies.They demonstrated their confidence in the future of this great country in the best way possible — with their money.This time round the wise insight came from Andy Haldane, the best economist at the Bank of England.Ruefully he said “economic forecasting is having a Michael Fish moment”.Michael Fish was the weather forecaster who completely mispredicted the huge 1987 storm that struck Britain.If only economic forecasters were even as good as weather forecasters, we would be a lot better off. But they are not, and they are at it again.This week Chancellor Philip Hammond predicted the Treasury would need to raise an extra £80billion in 15 years’ time in the event of a no-deal Brexit.And yet the Chancellor insists on ­trotting out yet another bogus forecast, on the very day that my successor as Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, is ­presenting the first set of preparation for no deal.Coincidence? I do not think so.The great departments of state are very careful about what they put in the public domain, and exactly when.For nobody is this more true than the Treasury, which has to judge the public perception of everything it does, if only because of its effect on the markets. So this was either spectacularly incompetent, or deliberate. I know what I think.And even more disgraceful, by doing so it will undermine the Government’s hand in striking a deal with the EU.If they do not think we dare walk away, then they will give us the worst deal they can think of. Bear in mind that the Chequers deal already concedes enormous amounts to the EU.It would not be long before our world-leading position in life sciences, gene technology, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and a whole range of other modern industries would be being actively undermined by the Europeans.As for being out of reach of the ­European Court, pull the other one.But now the Treasury is beginning to fear that even these spectacular concessions the Government has made in the Chequers deal will not deliver agreement from the European Commission — or if it does, the Commons will turn it down.In that event you can expect attempts by the Remainers in Parliament to try to scupper our departure by delaying it beyond the General Election, or offer some other enormous raft of concessions to give back control of the EU.Hence the ridiculous suggestion that the Army would be used to move food around the country.Why? What conceivable aspect of European policy would handicap British hauliers moving British products from Kent to Cumbria?None of course, but it was just the bogus nonsense some of our Remainer media is only too happy to carry ­completely uncritically. Similarly, we have heard suggestions of all sorts of shortages, based it seems mostly on the idea that the French might impede the flow of goods between Calais and Dover.It would not be the first time we had dealt with such issues. We had about 30 days of such delays in 2015. I remember queues of lorries, but I do not remember shortages of food or medicines.And on other issues, are the Europeans really going to pick a fight on data with the biggest IT power on the continent, on banking are they going to refuse to cooperate with the greatest financial ­centre in the world?Are the Greeks, Italians and Spaniards going to disadvantage the UK residents on whom many of their local economies depend? Or stop tourism? I think not.I suspect we are quite likely to have the odd hiccup when we leave the EU, but we will be able to cope, which is what Dominic Raab was demonstrating this week. And any problems we have will be over in months not years.So in 15 years’ time, far from worrying about Mr Hammond’s £80billion bill, the country will have trouble remembering what all the fuss was about.The biggest question will be whether we have made the most of the opportunities created by Brexit.And that is what we should worry about today, creating the circumstances where this great country can take its proper place in the world.

It looks like one figure until broken open and all the egos and rivalries come tumbling out. Inside this Cabinet doll are two moppets who think they could do a better job than the PM: Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Home Secretary Sajid Javid. And while they vie to be top banana they are united against a common enemy, Chancellor Philip Hammond. This trio are members of the 10-strong inner Cabinet chaired by the PM and charged with organising a smooth withdrawal from the EU. Its official tongue-twisting title is the European Union Exit and Trade (Strategy and Negotiations) sub-Committee – better known in Whitehall as the Brexit War Cabinet. Thing is, what Mrs May is really dealing with is a Cabinet at war. On Thursday, one of its two newest members, Dominic Raab (the other is Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt ) unveiled the first 24 of 84 no-deal Brexit papers. They were intended to reinforce his message that no deal is no big deal and whether the UK gets a deal or not we’ll barely notice leaving Europe.  But it was a tightrope act. On the one hand, the assessments of what no deal would look like had to be as bland as possible to avoid inflaming Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the European Research Group, a cabal of 62 Brexiteer Tory MPs. On the other, no deal had to be sufficiently unpalatable to urge MPs to support Mrs May’s Chequers proposals, hammered out seven weeks ago, for a negotiated EU settlement. Wobble Raab is no more than a mouthpiece for the PM’s chief Brexit adviser Olly Robbins. He held the tightrope. A Tory source said: “Dom is impotent. His department is really run by Olly.” But the Brexit Secretary could not even wobble to the end of the wire before the Chancellor knocked him off with what pro-EU campaigners called a “Brexit bazooka”. Spreadsheet Phil announced to Remainer Treasury Committee chair Nicky Morgan that no deal would cost \u0026pound80billion in extra borrowing. Theresa May hit the roof. A Whitehall source told the Sunday Mirror: “No10 ordered him not to do this. And they’re extremely annoyed he did. Dom worked his socks off, and then it’s deliberately overshadowed.” Spreadsheet is not entirely alone in Cabinet. He’s backed by Treasury Secretary Liz Truss and Energy minister Claire Perry. But colleagues consider Ms Truss a bit odd, and few listen to Ms Perry. If Michael Gove pitches himself against the Chancellor, he’ll be backed by three fellow Brexiteers – International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, \u0026shyTransport Secretary Chris Grayling and Commons leader Andrea Leadsom.

Medics are notorious for scrawling illegible notes – increasing costs and putting patients at risk. Mr Hancock will get rid of the need for them entirely by changing rules to help GP surgeries and pharmacies who do not already use electronic prescriptions to switch to them. Currently an electronic prescription can only be given if a patient has a nominated pharmacy. That restriction will be lifted this autumn. He said: “We need to harness technology across the NHS to improve care, save time for patients and make lives of hardworking staff easier.” More than 6,000 GPs – 63 per cent – are now able to upload prescriptions electronically so they can then be downloaded by a pharmacist.  The figure was just one per cent in 2010. But a Health Department source said: “There are still paper prescriptions being written. “That is throwing away taxpayers’ money. It’s Mr Hancock’s ambition to help more GPs and pharmacists embrace the digital revolution.” The NHS could save \u0026pound300million a year by 2021 if all prescriptions were electronic. Mr Hancock added: “It can’t be right that there are occasions when archaic paper prescriptions still have to be used. “Electronic prescribing saves GPs’ time and helps to give patients a better, more seamless experience.” "},{"url":null,"title":"gcse exams need reviewed because","story":"NewsopinionGCSE exams need to be reviewed because of student stressUnion leaders, teachers, children are all ­saying the same thing.

It’s a bit hazy but I got the basics – English, maths, science. Failed technology, passed history, which means I can’t change a plug but can tell you when it was invented. In the run-up we all had the usual anxieties and pressures. Queueing up outside one exam, a mate of mine told a teacher he was “scared”.  She said: “You’re not scared, you’re nervous. Scared is a different thing. There are plenty of things to be scared of – but not exams.” And she was right.

Their invention came about in order to toughen up the system on the back of those years of falling literacy, numeracy and the rest of it. We’ve all seen those \u0026shystories about how our kids are bottom of various league tables. Not as clever as the French and all that. So the decision was taken to make them hard. Really hard. But maybe we’ve gone a bit too far. Even Education Secretary Damian Hinds, left, struggled to explain the new grades on the radio this week. Of the 546 headteachers \u0026shysurveyed, 86 per cent said the new exams had led pupils to panic \u0026shyattacks and sleepless nights. Three quarters said pupils were suffering depression, two thirds said they had seen children self-harming due to the tests.

Snoozing in their bedroom lies Chitty, the first dog the pair ever adopted when they arrived in the country 10 years ago, and Polly, a feisty pup with just one eye.   Chitty and Polly soon join the couple’s other 96 dogs in the garden for breakfast. Some of the disabled ones need feeding individually to make sure they eat properly, and then there’s Joey, the Doberman, who is the couple’s biggest dog and requires one extra meal per day. After brekkie it’s nap time.  \u0027It’s so humid, the dogs spend most of the day snoozing in the shade, says Mary.   While this might not sound like everybody’s cup of tea, Mary couldn’t be happier.  Steve and I met in a pub when I was 26. I beat him in a game of pool and we clicked, explains Mary.  We built a life together. I worked in HR, Steve, now 59, was in manufacturing. We owned our own home in Bradford. We weren’t stinking rich, but 10 years ago we were comfortable enough to take a risk. We decided to go for early retirement and explore the world while we were still young enough to enjoy it.  A friend suggested they start their adventure in Kerala, India, home of palm tree-lined beaches overlooking the Arabian Sea. The pair rented out their home, sold most of their belongings on eBay and gave everything else to friends, family and charity shops. Then, in March 2008, they bought a two-week package holiday and jetted off.  While there we volunteered at an animal sanctuary and we fell in love with Chitty and Legsy, two puppies that had been found on the street. says Mary.  They’d wait for us to arrive each day and we couldn’t bring ourselves to leave them. The big move  So instead of leaving Kerala after the two weeks, Mary and Steve made the huge decision to stay put, checking out of their hotel and renting acommodation so they could take Chitty and Legsy home with them.  In those first few weeks we realised Kerala had a big problem with street dogs, explains Mary.   People here don’t treat dogs with the same affection we do. It’s not uncommon to throw stones at them. One of our dogs, Podge, came to us after her previous owner tied her back legs with wire, simply because she used to gnaw furniture. Shocked by what they saw, Mary and Steve started feeding the street dogs, and they hired a rickshaw with a driver to carry the food. The driver, Kukku, would slam on the brakes and dive into bushes, returning with a stricken dog he’d spotted.  We were kindred spirits, smiles Mary. In the dog house After four years, the dog lovers had adopted so many street dogs that they now shared their home with 40 rescues, and they decided to upsize.  Our new house is actually smaller, but the outdoor area is five times bigger, which means we could help more dogs, says Mary.  I never wanted kids, which baffled the locals. They thought there must be something wrong with me and asked if I’d been to hospital! It was soon after this that Mary and Steve set up a rescue centre called Street Dog Watch, and asked Kukku, their driver, to be clinic manager.  We realised we couldn’t keep taking in dogs without trying to get to the root of the problem, says Mary.  While it’s illegal to kill strays in Kerala, the fine is 50 rupees, which equates to 50p.  It’s not enforced anyway, says Mary. Before every tourist season, a barbaric culling programme would begin, with dead  dogs all over the streets. Locals put out poison too.   So Mary introduced the Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme, spaying and neutering street dogs, and giving them an anti-rabies vaccination.  PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) calculates that by sterilising 2,000 dogs, the ABC programme could have prevented the birth of over 60 million street dogs over the years.  The figure is staggering. It’s better that 60 million dogs never lived, than lived a life of suffering, says Mary. Four years ago, the couple sold their UK home to help fund their projects.  We’ve spent over \u0026pound300,000 of our own money, but it still doesn’t cover all our costs. Lots of animal lovers, both locally and in the UK, sponsor dogs or donate money. It costs \u0026pound15 to sterilise a street dog and \u0026pound25 to feed our dogs each day. All of Mary’s dogs are either injured street dogs or puppies found abandoned. They all have names too. Joey doesn’t like going outside, Podge is lazy, and Iolo was thrown over the clinic wall in a plastic bag. While he’s one of the smallest dogs, he’s also the most confident. Saving lives  Street Dog Watch continues to rescue, feed, vaccinate and sterilise. Healthy dogs are returned to the street or adopted, although locals only adopt males, thought to be better guard dogs.  Mary says, We have 89 females. Our five males can’t guard for toffee! They hide behind our legs.   People abroad often want to adopt the dogs, but Mary doesn’t recommend this.  It’s traumatic for a dog to travel a great distance and can cost \u0026pound5,000, she explains.  I encourage Brits to sponsor or donate towards our vaccination and feeding programmes instead. Better to adopt a dog already in the UK – there are plenty in need.  Mary is also in talks with the local government to agree funding for the ABC and anti-rabies programme. She has met with local authorities to dissuade them from a plan to build a cage in the forest to throw street dogs in.  They hadn’t thought about how they’d feed them, or what they’d do when they started breeding. I convinced them it was a terrible idea, explains Mary.  Mary and Steve’s retirement pot is dwindling, but the couple are happy to live frugally.  Our crockery is cracked and I rely on hand-me-downs from friends. I wear dresses until I wear them out then shred and plait them into dog toys. Old clothes also make great bedding and bandages, says Mary.  We don’t go out much – you can’t when you have 98 dogs! I don’t like to spend on myself when I know how much further money can go for the dogs.

But when I started crawling, huge blisters popped up all over my body from the friction of the floor on my skin.  My parents, both nurses, took me to the doctor right away, and after many tests I was diagnosed with a rare genetic skin condition called Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), which affects only half a million people worldwide.  Put simply, my skin lacks the protein that binds the layers together, and it blisters and tears at the slightest touch. You can imagine how tough this was as a child – I wanted to run about and climb trees, but in order to do the ordinary things that kids do, I had to wear thick padding all over my arms and legs.  For the most part the other kids were pretty accepting when I was little – it was as a teenager that life became challenging. Girls often struggle with self-esteem at that age anyway, but I was sure that no one would ever find me attractive because of my skin. I picked clothes that covered me up and I’d hide in the loo to change for PE. I remember being in a class once, chatting away with my scarred and blistered hands on display. A boy came wandering over, took one look at me and said, ‘Urgh, look at her hands!’ I was mortified and rushed home in floods of tears. That day stuck with me for years. Managing my skin  My daily routine has always been focused around my skin, which requires a lot of care. Every morning, I remove my bandages and run a bath with sea salt and baby bottle steriliser in it. I soak for about 20 minutes, then I shower with a special soap, dry myself carefully, and set up everything I need for the next, time-consuming stage.  With a small needle, I drain the blood blisters on my legs, before applying an antiseptic gel to any open wounds. Next, I apply cream to the patches of healthy skin, before bandaging up my entire legs and sticking large plasters over my bum and lower back. Because my legs are so long, I need lots of rolls of bandages.   EB affects me internally too. I have a narrowing of my oesophagus so I’m prone to choking on food and I get blisters in my throat.  Every four years I have an operation to widen my oesophagus – I’ve had it done three times, under general aesthetic. People with my condition also have a considerable chance of developing skin cancer by 35, and this is something I’m coming to terms with.  My model life  Because I’ve always been tall – I’m 5ft 11 – and skinny, I was often scouted by modelling agencies, but as a young teen I brushed their offers aside: there was no way I was confident enough to display my skin. After all, if I was too embarrassed to even tell my friends about my condition, how could I show my flesh on a catwalk or for a camera?   But at 17, I was tired of secrets and started to tell my friends about my EB. It was such a relief when I opened up – they were so understanding and were interested, because for years they’d never wanted to ask about my skin but they knew I didn’t want to talk.   Telling my friends felt like a weight lifted from my shoulders, and gave me the confidence boost I needed to try my hand at modelling. My first shoot was terrifying, but now I enjoy it – I’ve done campaign shoots with prestigious photographers and big brands like Misguided. In the early days, I’d make a feature of my skin in shoots, but I’m trying to stay away from that now because I want the message to be that your skin doesn’t define you as a person.

But wait, it\u0027s not over yet, we\u0027ve got one last bank holiday to go and it\u0027s really worth being prepared for it. By this point, we\u0027ve all had enough of cowering from the heatwave sun so the end-of-summer cooldown is most welcome. That means it’s the ideal time to get out and enjoy some activities. Below we\u0027ve pulled together some great ideas for making the most out of the last bank holiday before Christmas... Get out on a family cycling adventure  If you\u0027ve been putting off taking the kids out to practise cycling, this last bank holiday is the ideal time to get out for a ride. Head out to some quiet woodland, or check out the Halfords widget below to find your nearest cycling route.   If you want to head further afield, then don\u0027t forget that it\u0027s easy enough to add a bike rack to your car.  The Thule ProRide 591 Roof Mount Bike Carrier (above) is \u0026pound75 (save \u0026pound35) and useful because you can add more than one to a roof rack - making it perfect for growing families. Halfords also sell a wide range of roof racks - and will fit them for you too. Enjoy a camping trip to Scotland  One of the great things about Scotland - aside from the stunning countryside - is freedom to roam. It means camping is allowed on public, unenclosed, land for no more than two or three nights. Your other option is to visit one of the many existing campsites across the country, such as at Loch Lomond (try Ardlui), Loch Ness (consider Borlum), or one of the many along the coast (check out Clachtoll Beach Campsite at Sutherland).  For camping, we suggest the Halfords 4 Person Double Skin Tent (above) which is now just \u0026pound40, save \u0026pound60, and takes just 15 minutes to pitch. If you\u0027re driving with all your camping gear, you\u0027ll also want to consider boot space.  It\u0027s surprising how much stuff you need to take the kids away for a couple of nights and you don\u0027t want to be uncomfortable in the car.  For added space, grab the Exodus 470L Black Roof Box Fully Fitted Bundle (above) from Halfords. It\u0027s \u0026pound389 (save \u0026pound98) and includes the fitting and a roof rack suitable for your car. Find the perfect spot for a picnic  Take a picnic out with you and you\u0027ll have everything you need for a great day out. You could even pack the Halfords Portable Gas Stove (below), which is now \u0026pound8 (save \u0026pound12). But don\u0027t forget to pick up the correct Campingaz CP250 (A4) Gas Cartridge to go with it - these are just \u0026pound2 each or four for \u0026pound5.  Just make sure you\u0027re allowed to cook at your destination – many beaches only allow barbeques and small stoves after most people have gone home. It\u0027s well worth checking with the local council if you\u0027re not sure. Go on a great road trip!  A day trip or staycation break by road could be perfect for your family. Avoid queues by bagging a handy sat nav - which will also keep you on route and give you a pretty reliable answer to the \u0027are we there yet?\u0027 question. The Garmin Drive Sat Nav (below) - priced \u0026pound89.99 (save \u0026pound10) comes with lifetime map updates so you\u0027re never going to find yourself driving down a newly-closed street or down a disused road.  Also be sure to check your car is in good shape before heading out as there\u0027s nothing worse than planning a great bank holiday trip only to be thwarted by vehicle trouble. There are some simple things to keep an eye out for. Firstly, how is your car battery doing? Telltale signs that something is wrong include trouble starting the engine and lights that are dim when the engine isn\u0027t running - simple enough to check when you\u0027re parked up. Also, be wary that the hot summer months have a big impact on your car battery.

Noah Robinson did not leave hospital for 305 days while he went through a string of ops –and had to be brought back to life four times. And his beaming smile as he marked his birthday on Friday was a sight mum Mollie feared she might never get to see. Mollie said: “Once, his heart stopped for a full 20 minutes. Every second was an eternity, watching my impossibly tiny son looking like a lifeless bird.  “But every time we thought his time was up, he defied expectations and his little chest would start rising and falling again.” Noah was born at Leeds General Hospital at 27 weeks after Mollie’s placenta stopped providing blood and nutrients. He weighed just 495g, or 15oz. In the weeks that followed, he needed surgery for a hole in his heart, had a tracheostomy so he could breathe, had two hernias fixed, an op to fix his acid reflux, and a feeding tube in his tummy.  Mollie, 23, of Wakefield, West Yorks, said: “He was so small and fragile. Every time a doctor or nurse approached me I panicked, thinking they’d have bad news.” Faced with a two-hour trip to see Noah, Mollie was rescued by the Sick Children’s Trust, which runs a home at the hospital for parents like her.

Her mum Julia is there teaching her big brother John to play her banjo with its mother-of-pearl back, or John is  practising the guitar with his mates Paul and George in the kitchen as she and her sister Jackie jig about.   Her brother – a half-brother – was of course Beatles legend John Lennon .  That is breathtakingly clear when you see Julia’s face, with the same slim nose and pointed chin, now lined, giving a glimpse, spellbinding and heartbreaking, of how he might have looked today.   Her visits to that house in Allerton’s Springwood estate in Liverpool are bittersweet. Her mum and brother are long gone – Julia killed in a car accident in 1958 and John assassinated by Mark Chapman in New York in December 1980. Chapman was this week refused freedom at his 10th parole hearing.  Julia prefers not to talk about him. Even speaking of John’s death is still acutely painful for her. It could also hurt that John’s legacy is everywhere but the former teacher explains she has found embracing it is better than running away. “There is no escape,” she says. “And there is no point in pretending. It would hurt more to pretend I had nothing to do with him.”   What helps is the memory of those joyous early years before tragedy struck, the time when a teenage John first met Paul McCartney and George Harrison and invited them to join his band The Quarrymen.  It is 60 years since they made their first record with Percy Phillips’ Sound Recording Services. It was a rendition of Buddy Holly’s That’ll Be The Day and an original, In Spite of All The Danger. Two years later they became The Beatles. The record features in The Percy Phillips Studio Collection, which Julia will help launch tomorrow at the Beatles Convention in Liverpool.   Julia has taken on a directorship at the Cavern Club, where The Beatles played in their early years, but admits she never got to see them play there.  “We weren’t allowed at the Cavern. I was 14, but looked like a 10-year-old, and the bus home only went to Penny Lane after 9.20pm. Woe betide you if you missed it because you had to walk a few miles.”  But in 1964 she and sister Jackie went to see The Beatles at the Finsbury Park Astoria in London. Julia says: “The curtain went up and it was instant mayhem, I hated it. “They all rushed to the front and John is doing I Love You and he’s going, ‘Get the girls’. We were hauled on our stomachs back to the curtains. But I saw them in the kitchen often enough. And at home in our kitchen, where John was truly himself. “That kitchen is where it all happened.”  From the age of five, John had actually lived with his strict Aunt Mimi, his mother Julia’s sister. His mum had split from his dad, merchant seaman Alfred Lennon, who rarely returned from sea and was living with Bobby Dykins with whom she had her two daughters Julia and Jackie. John went to live with Mimi because, Julia says, she disapproved of her mother’s unmarried life with Bobby. But John always visited and was close to his younger sisters. Julia, 71, almost snaps when asked if he was different from other lads. She wants to stress their normality. “He was no different from any older brother on the road,” she says.  Sitting in Liverpool’s Hard Day’s Night Hotel, her brother’s voice on loop, she recalls the day of the church fete in Woolton in 1957 where John is said to have met Paul McCartney. The Quarrymen were playing and Paul just happened to come along. “It was a brilliant day, beautiful sunshine,” Julia says. “We met John at Woolton village, they were getting on the coal lorries that had been scrubbed, not entirely clean, him and his Quarrymen. “John sat at the end of the lorry. He was playing and Jackie and I went and grabbed a leg each to try and get him off. He was laughing his head off.” Then rehearsals began in earnest, with Paul joining The Quarrymen and then his younger pal, George Harrison. “I first met Paul in our kitchen,” says Julia. “He started coming round a lot. We all danced to Elvis and skiffle.”  The next year, days after The Quarrymen had recorded their first tracks, John and Julia’s mum was killed, struck by a car being driven by an off-duty police officer. Dealing with their loss as Beatlemania spiralled was tough. Julia says: “We were still suffering and then this huge thing was parallel. We all learned to separate things off in boxes.” Initially, John kept his little sisters close and Julia clearly remembers him coming home in 1964. “John slept on the floor in the front room. He wasn’t going to stay in a posh hotel in town.”  She also has fond memories of the Finsbury Park Astoria concert that year, laughing: “The Rolling Stones were in the dressing room so we knew they’d made it. They were all friends, drinking Coca-Cola – probably heavily laced.” She also recalls visiting John when he and first wife, Cynthia, moved with their son Julian to Surrey. Julia says: “We were opening fan letters and replying, ‘Yes, I will marry you, I’ll meet you at the church tomorrow’.” But after John moved to New York with Yoko Ono in 1971, they lost touch. In 1974, Julia finally received a phone call. They spoke for four hours. She says: “There was a lot of laughing and a lot of crying. He said, ‘Describe the room you’re in,’ and I said, ‘There are photos of Mummy and you and Jackie all round the walls’, and he said, ‘Send them to me’. So I stripped the walls.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lotto results saturdays winning national","story":"NewsLotto results: Saturday\u0027s winning National Lottery numbers for £3.1million jackpotTonight\u0027s Lotto numbers and the results of the Millionaire Maker Raffle and Thunderball drawsShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter20:30, 25 AUG 2018Updated20:34, 25 AUG 2018NewsThe lottery jackpot tonight is £3.1m (Image: PA)Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Tonight\u0027s National Lottery jackpot is a whopping \u0026pound3.1million - so are you feeling lucky?

Tiggywinkles Animal Hospital says the number of patients has soared because the heat has dried up their water sources and killed off the bugs they feast on. Birds and baby hedgehogs are among the worst hit. Tiggywinkles veterinary nurse Francesca Campanaro said: “There’s so much coming in it’s non stop. “We have seen a 25 per cent increase in animals we have taken in over the last few weeks. “With the lack of water and the dry ground there’s nothing for them to eat or drink.”  Francesca, 37, has been working at the wildlife hospital near her home in Aylesbury, Bucks for the past 20 years, and has treated animals from a pelican to an African polecat.

Despite some sunny spells, many people faced a miserable start to the three-day break, with the North particularly hit by rain. Although revellers at the Reading Festival enjoyed some sunshine, its sister event in Leeds saw crowds don hoods and plastic macs to keep dry. And the wet weather conditions are set to last until the end of today, forecasters warn. The Met Office has predicted bad weather across the country, with prolonged and heavy rain throughout the day.  Some areas could see winds hit 40mph as the bad weather hits.

But there could be better news on the horizon, according to long-range forecasts.  Models show higher than average temperatures could last until November. September is likely to see a good deal of dry, warm and settled weather, the Met Office says. Its forecast for the next 30 days states: Daytime temperatures are expected to be above average overall, especially across the south and east. It may become very warm for a time, and with the warmer conditions perhaps spreading further north and west with time.

The Aston Martin DP215 Grand Touring Competition Prototype reached a staggering 198.6mph in practice at the French track in 1963. It made it the fastest speed ever recorded by a front engine car on the old course there. Despite being tipped for victory a gearbox failure ruled it out of the race, and it never competed again. Owners Neil and Nigel Corner restored the racer before it went under the hammer at Sotheby’s in Monterey, California.   MirrorOnline reported earlier this month how James Bond\u0027s Aston Martin DB5 had been named the greatest movie car ever, according to a poll.  The iconic motor was first seen in 1964’s Goldfinger and has appeared in seven Bond movies to date, most recently in 2015’s Spectre. It comes equipped with a host of gadgetry including a bullet-proof rear windscreen, in-built machine guns, tyre slashers – and an ejector seat.

Paul Manafort, the President’s former campaign chairman, was convicted of fraud on Tuesday. On the same day, Michael Cohen, Mr Trump’s former personal attorney, pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges. Both men are facing jail sentences. For now, Cohen’s plea is more significant. Cohen testified that he facilitated payments to two women, “in co-ordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office” in order to influence the 2016 presidential election. Cohen’s lawyer later confirmed that this candidate was Donald Trump. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is unlikely to bring charges against Trump, however, because he is the sitting president. This means that the main danger to Trump is his removal from office via Congress. Firstly, the president must be impeached through a simple majority in the House of Representatives.  After that, Trump would only be removed after a trial in the US Senate. A conviction requires two-thirds of senators to vote in favour. No president has ever been removed this way. Richard Nixon resigned before his impeachment vote, while the Senate acquitted Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson. The process is steeped in politics and there are a number of issues that need to be resolved before Trump’s fate becomes clear. Most importantly, the Republicans have majority control of the House of Representatives, so any impeachment attempt would almost certainly fail in Washington’s highly partisan political climate.

The porn actress spoke to the Sunday Mirror about her troubled childhood, estranged parents and her failed relationships. Her third marriage, to musician Glendon Crain, crumbled under the pressure of the Trump fallout. And she believes any chance of finding love again is doomed as she spends most of her time surrounded by bodyguards after death threats. Stormy revealed how she learned to stand up for herself at a young age. An only child, she claimed her mum Sheila Gregory virtually abandoned her, leaving her to go hungry in their filthy home in a downtrodden part of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  Stormy, 39, told the Mirror: “I was about six when she first left me home alone with no food. It makes me upset that anyone would do that. “My daughter is much more brave and smart than I was at that age and I still can’t imagine that happening to her. I had to take care of myself, no one is going to do it for you. “Some people rise to the challenge and some people get stuck in that cycle of whatever their life is. “Maybe it’s poverty, maybe it’s drugs and alcohol, maybe teen pregnancy, maybe joining a gang. The cycle tends to repeat itself. “I didn’t want to do that. I wanted to prove everybody wrong.” Sheila, 64, has insisted she did all she could to support her daughter – working three jobs after Stormy’s dad Bill walked out. The rift, however, seems permanent. But while Stormy has completely cut herself off from her birth family, she has adopted a gay couple as her “parents”. She refers to both Keith Munyan and his partner JD Barrale as “Dad”. Keith, who befriended Stormy when she first moved to LA to work in porn, is godfather to her daughter.  He was one of four people who confirmed key elements of her alleged affair with Trump when she signed the original non-disclosure agreement. Stormy revealed how Keith and JD were horrified that Trump’s running mate in the 2016 election – and now Vice President – was Mike Pence, who has been slammed by the LGBT community over his stance on gay rights. She explained: “My adopted dads have replaced my real family, for sure. I live with them when I’m in LA. “When they heard Mike Pence was running, that was very upsetting for them. That was when sh*t got real. They were really afraid they weren’t going to be together, that was the hardest part, seeing people so close to me so upset and so devastated. “On election night, I was in my house in Dallas, texting them. I was trying to talk them down off a ledge, saying I’m sure the next result will be fine. But we all know how that turned out. They were really upset.” Stormy, who has appeared in porn movies and stars in a touring strip show in the US, has no regrets about her career. She says she wouldn’t stop her daughter, aged seven, following in her footsteps when she grows up.

In an exclusive interview, Stormy said that she:  Will give evidence to Congress against Trump if he is impeached. Has received death threats from the President’s supporters. Was reduced to tears by women who turned to her for support after suffering sex harassment. Learned to stand up for herself after a tough childhood in which she was left home alone without food.  Stormy spoke in the same week that Trump’s former lawyer Mike Cohen, 52, pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance laws by paying her $130,000 “hush money”.  Another of the President’s alleged lovers, ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal, 47, is said to have had her silence bought in a $150,000 deal with the pro-Trump National Enquirer. And fresh claims emerged yesterday that Trump, 72, also had a secret love child with a housekeeper. The President faces yet more \u0026shypressure on three fronts: The ongoing probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election a poll boost for rival Democrats which could hasten an impeachment vote and reported immunity for key figures helping the authorities probe hush money payments. Stormy told the Mirror: “If Donald Trump has done things he shouldn’t have during his campaign he should be impeached. If he has broken the law he should be arrested and treated like anyone else. “I’ll happily testify under oath and prove my story is true. “I have always said that the truth is the most important thing and that is why I spoke out in the first place – so I can look my daughter in the eye and know I was honest. Now the truth is coming out and justice must be done.” Stormy, 39, claimed she was initially intimidated into keeping silent and is suing both Trump and Cohen amid claims a non-disclosure agreement she signed is invalid.  She told us: “I will not be silenced, but being called a liar is the hardest part. I am glad other people are now telling the truth. I am just fighting for the truth and I believe everyone should be treated equally. Trump probably wishes he’d never met me, but a lot of men feel like that.” Last weekend the articulate mum of one turned down a reported \u0026pound750,000 to appear on Celebrity Big Brother after, she claims, Channel Five “screwed” her at the last minute. Stormy talked to the Mirror earlier this week at a secret location in the English countryside. She spoke about meeting Trump at a Lake Tahoe golf event in 2006. Stormy claims they had sex once then – and met up on two further occasions. The President has been swamped by accusations of sexually harassing women. But Stormy said: “I have to be very clear he DIDN’T do that to me, it was consensual. But if the allegations from other women are true he should be in jail.” Of her alleged fling with Trump, she said: “I’m normally such a prude! I don’t do one-night stands. “People would be surprised to know that outside work I have only slept with about 25 men. If I see a cute guy in a bar, I chicken out. But on this occasion I was intrigued by Trump. I like very interesting people.” Stormy is prevented from revealing intimate details due to her ongoing lawsuit. But she says she barely recognised Trump when they met. July 2006  Donald Trump meets Stormy Daniels at a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, just four months after wife Melania gives birth to their son Barron, now 12. Daniels claims she had sex with the tycoon. October 2016 Daniels is paid $130,000 by lawyer Michael Cohen to keep quiet about the alleged affair, just weeks before voters go to the polls. She now claims she was intimidated into silence. November 2016 Trump wins the presidency, defeating rival Hillary Clinton in a result which sends shockwaves around the world. January 2018 The Wall Street Journal carries a report about the payment and names Daniels. Trump denies both the affair and any knowledge of the payment. March 2018 Daniels takes legal action against Trump in a bid to prove the non-disclosure agreement is not valid because he didn’t sign it. April 2018 Cohen’s office is raided by the FBI, which seizes emails, tax documents and business records. August 2018 Cohen admits breaking election laws by paying hush money to two women, believed to be Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, who also claims to have had sex with Trump. She went on: “There were lots of people around but I didn’t go after him. I didn’t chat him up and he didn’t chat me up – we were just talking. I knew very little. I wasn’t a fan of his and I’d never watched The Apprentice. “He didn’t yell ‘You’re fired’, although I bet now he wishes he had.” At the time, the tycoon’s wife Melania, 48, was at home nursing their four-month-old son Barron. Washington is awash with rumours that Melania, now First Lady, feels trapped and miserable in her marriage. But Stormy said: “People should stop speaking for her. Maybe she’s happy. Everything we say about her is a projection. Some people misplace sorrow and pity on another person. “The entire world would be interested to know what she feels. But if we never know, that is her right and I support it.” Stormy said she forgot all about Trump until he ran for President – to her “amusement and disbelief”. During campaigning a tape emerged in which he boasted he could do anything with women because he was a “star”, adding: “Grab them by the pu**y.” Stormy said: “I’m shocked there are women who are okay with it. It’s my job to grab women and if I said that I’d get in more trouble than him.” It was in January this year that the story broke of Stormy and Trump’s alleged fling. Overnight, she became an icon for women who claimed they had suffered harassment – even though Stormy insists that her relationship with Trump was consensual. She went on: “I’d no idea I would end up standing up for everyone but it has been a privilege I never expected. “It’s hard enough to face these powerful people but to have others place their hope and trust in you is a big deal. I’m not a feminist, I’m just human.” Stormy revealed that one woman confided in her that her sister had killed herself after being raped. Others have said her experience encouraged them to report abuse and sexual harassment.  Stormy – who appears in US clubs in a touring strip show – said: “I sometimes go back to my dressing room after listening to other people’s stories and it just makes me want to cry. “Sometimes we all cry together. But I am there to do a job so I pull myself together and then get back on stage. “I can be standing completely naked on stage and a woman will start crying. I’m like: ‘Oh my God, I really just want to hug you’.” Stormy said standing up to Trump came at a price. In March, she received so many death threats that she had to hire two bodyguards who never leave her side. Some of Trump’s fanatical supporters have bombarded her with terrifying messages. One man approached her in a car park, said she had a lovely daughter and “it would be a shame if something happened to her Mommy”. Stormy added: “I’ve been told: ‘Watch out, b*tch I’m coming for you, I’m going to cut your throat’ – and ‘Your kid should be euthanised’. It’s horrible stuff.” Stormy has now left the UK for a secret location following the row over her last-minute exit from Celebrity Big Brother.

Following her miraculous rescue from the Adriatic Sea Kay Longstaff told Croatian TV that she fell from the back of the Norwegian Star while it was en route to Italy. She had plunged 75ft from the seventh deck into the sea. Kay said her love of yoga kept her fit enough to keep swimming and said she sang to keep warm as she drifted throughout the night.   According to the Mail on Sunday investigators in Croatia and Italy have both decided that the air stewardess did in fact jump.  The paper reports the investigators saying she did so \u0027voluntarily\u0027 – and in a ‘determined’ fashion. However what caused her to jump remains unknown. Ms Longstaff has not spoken in public since the rescue despite several contradictory reports about her potentially rowing with her partner the night she disappeared overboard.

Her partner Craig Rayment was said to be in bed when the drama unfolded. The electrician reported her missing at 2am, several hours after she vanished. The 46-year-old will not have to contribute to the cost of her rescue, thought to run into several hundred thousand pounds. Croatia’s Ministry of Maritime Affairs said ‘international agreements’ prevent Croatia from forcing the woman to pay up.

Pope Francis delivered his address and heard five testimonies by families from Ireland, Canada, India, Iraq, and Africa about the importance of family in the modern age. The concert-type event was held to mark the end of the World Meeting of Families 2018, including performances by Andrea Bocelli, The Riverdance Troupe, Nathan Carter, Dana Masters and Daniel O\u0027Donnell. During his speech he said: “To hate is human. To forgive is divine. He then got the crowd to repeat “sorry, please and thank you” a number of times.  His comments came just hours after he met with eight Irish survivors of clerical, religious and institutional abuse following wide condemnation of the Catholic Church’s handling of multiple clerical abuse scandals. During the first day of his weekend visit he was met by protesters angry at how the church dealt with abuse scandals that have damaged trust in the religious institution and seriously weakened its influence on Irish society. An abuse survivor who met him earlier said he condemned the corruption and cover up within the Catholic Church as “caca,” meaning ‘excrement’ in English.  A Vatican spokesman said: “Pope Francis met early Saturday evening for an hour and half with eight Irish survivors of clerical, religious and institutional abuse.”  But the Pope made no comment on the issue of abuse within the church during his speech at Croke Park tonight.  During the event he heard from a Christian family who had been forced to flee to Australia from Iraq to escape ISIS. A man, called Rami, said his brother, who was a Catholic priest, was killed by ISIS and then they lost their father to cancer. There were also numerous performances from local acts and people around the world. Rita Coyne from Dublin watched the show along with her friend Mary Byrne, and said she was uplifted by the amount of young people involved. It\u0027s brilliant, it\u0027s very different, it\u0027s very beautiful, so different from what I expected, I found it very joyful.  The young people involved, the colours and the dancers have been super. It\u0027s been absolutely lovely.  The selection of themes throughout the night reflected the priorities in the ministry of the Pope, including homelessness, migrants and refugees and care for our common home. Nuns from the Sisters of Nazareth, Sister Francis Kelly and Sister Celine came to Ireland for the World Meeting of Families and say the concert was the perfect end to an excellent week.  Earlier today the Pope gave a talk at Capuchin Day Centre for Homeless in front of a group of disadvantaged people who use the centre and thanked them for trusting the Capuchin fathers.  “They help you without taking away your dignity,” he said. “That’s the face of Jesus Christ.” The Pope offered a blessing to those in attendance before meeting a number of volunteers who work in the centre. Before visiting the homeless centre he met newlywed and engaged couples and even made a few jokes about marriage at St Mary\u0027s Pro Cathedral. He also sat for a number of minutes of silent prayer at an altar that houses a perpetually lit candle for the victims of clerical sex abuse.  Fans waved flags and screamed during his drive to and from the cathedral as one little girl was seen waving a flag featuring his picture while others brandished white flags with hearts on.  Another fan held a banner saying \u0027Bless Me Papa\u0027 while women raised their arms in the air in a bid to get his attention. However, amid the cheers from supporters, protesters shouted and swore at him as he passed the entrance to Dublin Castle on Dame Street. One protester held up a shocking banner accusing the Pope of being the \u0027head of the biggest paedophile ring in the history of man.’ Earlier he spoke of the failure of church authorities to tackle the grave scandal of clerical abuse in Ireland. The Pope confronted the issue in a speech at Dublin Castle, saying he shared the feelings of pain and shame.

safranko admits understanding the dundonian accent has been his biggest hurdle","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United new boy Pavol Safranko has revealed the biggest hurdle he’s encountered since arriving has been learning to work out English – Scottish-style.The Slovakian international was an instant hit in Tangerine as he scored a cracking debut goal in the 2-0 win at Queen of the South a fortnight ago.And from what he’s seen of Scottish football so far, the 23-year-old is feeling good about fitting in to life in the Championship with United.Having already switched countries successfully once when he moved from Dunajska Streda in his homeland to Danish outfit Aalborg last year, he did not anticipate too many problems with getting used to the culture here.Particularly as his language of choice in Denmark was very often English.“I was one year in Denmark and everyone speaks English and I thought this is good for me coming here,” he said.“But when I came to the training ground from Dundee for the first time, the taxi driver spoke with me and I didn’t understand anything.“I had to ask him two or three times to say again before I understood what he said. It was not a big problem because he was a nice guy.“I will try to learn the accent here and it will happen but when I arrived it was more difficult to understand English here than I thought it would be.”While learning to speak, or at least understand, Dundonian, Safranko will also be reading up on the opposition he’s going to face in the Championship, starting with today\u0026#8217s visitors Partick Thistle.For him, though, the most important factor being at Tannadice will be getting to know his team-mates and focusing on playing to his and their strengths.“I do not know Partick Thistle. I do not know too much about any of the other clubs, so we have to see some videos, play games, and after I can say something about our opponents.“I think this can be a good thing. You always have to start from the ‘us’, from what we will do and not think too much about the other teams. This is a good way to build the winning mentality.“It’s more important to learn about team-mates than the other teams. I have had three weeks training now, that helps.“And it is important that we are winning games while we are learning about each other. There are many new players here and we will get better as a team but we must win while this happens.”With that impressive debut coming down in the Dumfries, for most United fans today will be their first glimpse of Safranko.Giving them a preview of what to expect he’s told them to look for him in the penalty box. He knows that’s where his worth to the team lies and that is where he wants to spend most of his time.“I am a striker who gets into the penalty box. This is my area to play. Hey, I am not good outside the box – I know where I am and that is where I play.“I hope this is good for United and that it is where we will play. Then I can help the team and that is what is most important.“We were good in my first game and we were the better team first half, so we were attacking.“Maybe not second half but we won. I hope the second game will be even better.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7fd04af1b5a-836x564.jpg ","title":"elton ngwatala dundee players must trust each other to turn form around","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBelief is key for Dundee, says Elton Ngwatala, if they are to chalk up their first league points of the campaign.The Dark Blues will make the short journey to Perth to take on Tayside rivals St Johnstone in what has become a crucial fixture.The Dens men go into the clash stuck on zero points after two Premiership games keen not to repeat their slow start to last season.It took last year’s team until mid-September to register their first victory of the campaign – notably against today\u0026#8217s opponents, Saints, in a 3-2 victory at Dens Park.To repeat that, Ngwatala – one of the summer recruits – insists it’s about the players trusting each other to earn themselves a first win of the campaign.The Frenchman said: “Last week was, obviously, a very disappointing result for us but I think we have to look forward now.“We are back in the league matches and we have to start winning games, that’s the most important thing.“We can take a lot from the last game and learn from our mistakes. We will do everything we can to win but we have to score as well.“Obviously, we can do so much better than we have done.“Everybody in the team knows that but we have to improve and keep improving every week.“Now, everybody is on it. Everybody wants to do the best for the team, whatever the starting XI or subs, everybody wants to be part of it and we need that to be successful.”Before the 3-0 home loss to Championship side Ayr United, Dundee’s big problem was putting away the chances they were creating against St Mirren and Aberdeen.The defeat to the Honest Men has put a whole different spin on the club’s start to the season, however.Ngwatala, though, says there is plenty of talent in the current squad to create a positive twist in the story of Dundee’s season tomorrow at McDiarmid Park.“The first two games, I don’t think we deserved to lose,” he added.“That’s the way it is, though, and now I think we have to be prepared to fight every game.“As a team you have to give everything to get the win.“Even if we have to wait to score in the 95th-minute we’ll do that – you have to believe to the end.“We have to go there with confidence and express ourselves and do the best we can to get the three points.”And Ngwatala says the points will only be heading their way if they can work as a team and trust each other to get the better of their Tayside rivals – that’s the message from boss Neil McCann, anyway.“The manager has said we have to believe in ourselves, believe in what we can do and trust each other.“If we do that, we’ll get what we deserve.“It’s going to be a tough game – we have to treat this game like any other and prepare like we would against any team.“We must go there and do everything we can to get a result.”In those two league games, getting anything positive on the scoresheet was a big issue with Ngwatala the only Dundee player yet to find the net.He’s pleased to have got off the mark in goalscoring terms but would much rather have points on the board.“It was good for me to get the first goal so now I’m relaxed, the first is gone and I can carry on now.“However, I need my teammates to help me score and I will help them to do the same.“I want to score but when I do, I want my team to win, not just get a goal and we lose the game.“I want to help my team get points, that’s all I want.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7fd016034e9-e1535108915987-720x564.jpg ","title":"feat of strength recognised at holyrood","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee-born nurse who became the first woman in almost half a century to conquer a remarkable test of strength has been congratulated by the Scottish Parliament.Leigh Holland-Keen, 29, lifted the Dinnie Stones – two granite boulders that together weigh 733lb – in front of a crowd of 400 people.She was the first female in 40 years to do so and one of fewer than 100 people who have accomplished the feat.Ms Holland-Keen, who now lives in Australia, made history at Potarch, on Deeside, where the stones sit outside the Old Potarch Hotel.A North-East MSP has now marked the Sydney strongwoman’s feat with a motion at Holyrood.Scottish Conservative Alexander Burnett said: “Fewer than 100 people have managed to lift the stones since Donald Dinnie carried them the length of the Potarch Bridge in 1860.“Leigh was the first woman to do so in about 40 years.

But contemporary photographs held in the city’s archives show that 31-33 Castle Street was not demolished.The sandstone building was annexed and included in the design and construction of the new Caird Hall complex and received a fresh, modern appearance.Unfortunately, history buffs can no longer see the castle rock as the final touches to the building included the provision of false walls and new flooring in the basement.The former Kennedy’s Steak House closed several years ago and has lain empty ever since.The council-owned building had slipped into a state of disrepair.In a bid to attract a new occupant to the site, an “extensive” refurbishment of the building is under way.In all, £183,000 has been set aside to strip out the unit and make it ready for a new tenant to move

chance he gets this campaign with both hands.The 19-year-old featured in the two final home matches of last season, as a substitute in a 1-0 win over Hamilton before starting the home defeat to Partick Thistle that concluded the campaign.The Welshman, who started his career in Swansea’s youth academy, joined the Dark Blues in January after leaving Colchester United and impressed in the U/20s team that narrowly missed out on the Development League title.He also grabbed a goal in last week’s Irn-Bru Cup win over Hibs Colts for the Dundee youth side and says he thinks he’s ready for another shot at first-team football.Though, he admits jokingly, he might have to calm himself next time he’s out on the pitch in the senior game.Describing his time in the first team last season, he said: “I loved every second of it – once you step on that pitch everything is mad, it’s crazy and you don’t know what to do!“You need to calm yourself down a bit but I’m buzzing to have played for the first team and, hopefully, I can get more chances this season.“I think I’m ready to make the step up.“With the players in front of me in my position, I’m always learning from them, they are always helping me and everyone around the training ground is helping me.“If I do get a chance this year, I’ll give my all and I think I am ready for it – I’ll definitely take it with both hands and I won’t look back.”As a centre-back, Jefferies certainly has plenty of competition to get through ahead of him.As far as central defenders go, the Dark Blues boast an array of experience – Steven Caulker being an England international and former Liverpool and Spurs defender, Darren O’Dea won numerous trophies at Celtic, Josh Meekings is a Scottish Cup winner and Genseric Kusunga has two Swiss league titles to his name.For Jefferies, that doesn’t pose an insurmountable hurdle but rather gives him an ideal opportunity to learn from players who have been there and done it.He added: “In training if you make a mistake, they don’t really get on to you, they encourage more than anything.“They want everyone to improve every day and because I’m young, I’m 19, I look up to the likes of Steven Caulker, Darren O’Dea, Josh Meekings and Gense – I mean, they’ve got some amount of experience.“I hope they can share it with me and I can move on with them.”After making the move north, Jefferies has settled into life quickly in Dundee and says the possibility of first-team football at a club with the stature of the Dark Blues was a big draw for him.“It was a quick six months at Colchester before the opportunity came about up here,” he added.“It’s a good club, I love it here, the people are friendly and I think I can learn more up here and maybe break into the first team.“The manager definitely gives young players a chance if he thinks they deserve it.“He believes in the youngsters and I am very grateful for the chance I had last season.“Hopefully, I can get more this year.“We play the same way as the first team and it’s all the same at Dundee so it’s not too much of a step up from reserve football but it’s older men with experience and you just have to put yourself about.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"life long dundee fan liverpool midfielder charlie adam linked with move away from stoke bolton wanderers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee fan Charlie Adam looks set for

Whether or not either is fit to start on Saturday remains to be seen.A swollen knee means Murdoch hasn’t played since the Betfred Cup tie against Alloa a month ago.Whereas Booth’s absence stretches back a few days longer, to when he picked up a knock at Ross County in his only competitive appearance so far.Just the fact both are back working normally, however, is good news for their gaffer, though he remains frustrated by the continued absence of winger Billy King because of a thigh injury.“Callum Booth has trained with the team and also Stewart Murdoch has trained fully with the team, so they are now fit.“Billy King is still struggling with this stupid injury that he didn’t even get from training,” added Csaba.“He hasn’t done one training session so far this season.“Last season he was one of the most important players for the team but he is struggling with this injury and it continues to affect him.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/07/image.jpg@1.568496.jpg ","title":"today fun day hopes to boost dundee community spirit and revive high street","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHopes are high that a fun day in Lochee will revive some community spirit while offering activities for the whole family to enjoy.\u0026nbspOrganised by volunteers from multiple community groups including The Village of Lochee Community Partnership, Lochee Community Hub and Lochee Parish Church, today\u0026#8217s event is funded by the Community Regeneration Forum.Visitors to the High Street will be able to enjoy a performance by the Lochee Music Group, as well as appearances by Peppa Pig and Spider-Man.Meanwhile, along at the community hub there will be face painting, crafts, balloon modelling and a cake and candy stall.Lochee Library will also be involved, offering an opportunity to peruse stalls, get involved in some craft activities and enjoy an animal handling station.There will be some outdoor pursuits at the community garden, such as planting and a mini-garden festival, and refreshments will be available.

He said: “He really kept everyone going.“He was always laughing and joking, even right to the end, making jokes in the hospital.”Charleston School acting head teacher Anna Cartlidge said: “Mr Ingram was the school crossing patroller for Charleston School for about 15 years and was a favourite with pupils, staff, and motorists. He was a real character in the Cove community known for his very happy character.“We were very proud when he won a school crossing patroller competition in 2012, as the title was very well deserved.“When the family asked if they could drive past the school to celebrate Mr Ingram’s work here, we were only too happy to oblige, and such was his standing in the local area, some P7 pupils, staff, and parents stood out the front of the school to wave him by.”John was voted the Evening Express Crossing Patroller of the Year in 2012 and came second in a national competition.He leaves behind his four grandchildren, along with son Graeme, 62, and daughter Donna, 53.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science hub go ahead","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlans to build a new £35 million science teaching hub have been given the go-ahead.Proposals have been approved for the Aberdeen University hub on the corner of St Machar Drive and Bedford Road.This would see a new building dedicated to science laboratories created on the corner of St Machar Drive and Bedford Road, on university grounds.Aberdeen University senior vice-principal Professor Phil Hannaford said: “We’re delighted to have been granted planning permission to build this fantastic new facility which will transform science teaching for students at the University of Aberdeen.“As an institution, we have already outlined our commitment to invest heavily in our infrastructure so we continue to attract the brightest and best students from all over the world to the north-east of Scotland.”Planners have granted the application, stating that the design of the development would make a “positive contribution” to the environment and provide a gateway site to the campus, while also providing further high quality educational facilities for the university.Their decision notice added: “The proposal is considered to be a high-quality development befitting of the surrounding conservation area.”The ambitious multi-million-pound project aims to transform the science learning experience at the university.Featuring cutting-edge facilities and a flexible teaching space, the university hopes it will encourage schoolchildren to get involved in science subjects.It would also provide the main teaching laboratories for students studying chemistry, physiology, biomedical sciences, geosciences and biological sciences.The proposed location for this building is a piece of undeveloped land on campus beside the Sir Duncan Rice library.The university has previously said it hopes the building will be available for teaching students in 2021.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"web works disruption","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA broadband operation is due to bring further disruption to an area of the city.Cityfibre, an initiative to bring superfast internet to the Granite City, will close several streets over the coming weeks.Auldearn Lane in Kincorth, between the junctions with Cairngorm Drive and the gable end of numbers 25-35 of Auldearn Gardens, will be closed between 8am today and 5pm tomorrow.The works will then move to Tollohill Lane, between its junction with Tollohill Square and a point 10 metres north of the junction, between 8am on Wednesday and 5pm on Thursday.A notice from Aberdeen City Council (ACC) states that any cars that are parked illegally will be removed at the expense of the owner.Disruption is due to continue in the Kincorth area until September 9, when the first phase of works is complete.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 30","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/07/18, 3:43 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.It was a case of \u0026#8216all\u0026#8217s well that ends well\u0026#8217 for young Adam in the Furnace hills last week.Police officers and his mum left him in no doubt of how narrow an escape he had.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautiful and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"junior championship at lochgilphead golf club","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/08/18, 6:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe juniors took to the course last Thursday and Friday August 9 and 10 to compete for the coveted title of Junior Champion for 2018.Day one saw Ruan McKellar finish with a fantastic gross 92, giving him an eight shot lead over his brother Kern.

The new charging schedule will streamline the process of providing the film industry with a flexible range of options for film productions using council assets.The process will also ensure the council is providing a fair approach to charging, avoiding uncertainty and delay with enquiries.

The work they have put in over last year has been admirable and  we hope we have given Mid Argyll a band to be proud of.\u0026#8217Pipe Major Stuart Liddell of Inveraray and District was pleased with his band\u0026#8217s result, commenting: \u0026#8216It has been another fantastic season for the band \u0026#8211 having been second in four of the five championships, winning the Europeans in Forres and securing the Champion of Champions for the third consecutive year.\u0026#8216The competition this year has been of a very high level and has been interesting to see four different bands lift titles \u0026#8211 Scottish Power (British), St Lawrence O\u0026#8217Toole from Ireland (UK and Scottish), ourselves (European) and Field Marshall Montgomery \u0026#8211 who have just been crowned the world champions for the 12th time under Pipe Major Richard Parkes, equalling the record set by the legendary Pipe Major Ian McLellan of Strathclyde Police.\u0026#8216It is great to be included amongst these great bands and the consistency is reflective of all the hard work that goes into it.\u0026#8217Elsewhere, in Novice A, Oban High School came second behind Dollar Academy.Kintyre Schools came an excellent fifth in a Novice B competition featuring 19 bands from across the globe.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"youth shinty takes macaulay centre stage","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/08/18, 3:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowPrior to the senior shinty Macaulay Cup Final on Saturday August 18, three Argyll and Bute district teams contested a round-robin tournament at the nearby rugby club.The tournament featured S1 teams representing Oban/Ballachulish, Mid Argyll and Cowal and Bute.Mid Argyll were up first against the Oban area team.

The Labour list MSP hit out as it was announced rail users traveling to Glasgow from Kilmarnock will have to shell out an additional \u0026pound55 for season passes. Regulated rail fares are set to rise by 3.2 per cent, in line with the retail price index rate of inflation, from January. That will see a season pass increase from \u0026pound1692 to \u0026pound1746. Commuters in Ayr would see an increase of \u0026pound78 from \u0026pound2452 to \u0026pound2530 for a season pass. Mr Smyth said: “These rail fare rises are unwanted, unwelcome and unnecessary. “It is simply unfair that commuters in Ayrshire are being burdened with these rip-off rail fares for less than satisfactory services.  “The cost of rail fares being paid by passengers is simply unacceptable, with passengers from Kilmarnock having to fork out \u0026pound1746 a year to travel to and from work. “Scottish Labour is clear: it’s high time working people stopped having to pay such excessive fares to simply line the pockets of private companies. “Only Labour is fighting for a publicly owned railway which will serve the many, not just the few.” Elsewhere, an annual Lockerbie-Edinburgh fare will now cost \u0026pound5250 – up \u0026pound162 – after the Scotish Government decided peak fares were to increase. Transport secretary Michael Matheson said the rises were “unwelcome” and stressed action had been taken to minimise them.  Increases in off-peak fares in Scotland will be held at 2.2 per cent as the government have pledged to cap them at 1 per cent below inflation. All fares in England will rise by the RPI rate of inflation. Mr Matheson said: “This means in Scotland average fares increases are lower than England and Wales.” In recent months staff from rail union RMT have staged protests in cities around the UK. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT, said it was “nothing short of a scandal” that ticket prices were up to five times more than fares in Europe. Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles MSP said the rises are the last thing hard-up passengers need.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartyScottish LabourGlasgowAyrKilmarnockEconomyTransportLockerbieKilmarnock NewsTransport ScotlandCheap travel"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"musical tribute concert honour loved","story":"NewsMusical tribute concert will honour loved onesFollowing on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month.Share\u0026nbspByAbi Smillie16:27, 22 AUG 2018NewsColin Price and Pauline Moriarty join together for the tribute concert (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA musical tribute concert will honour the lives of two well loved members of the community. Following on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month. Joan Price, a beloved trombone player, was tragically killed in a road traffic accident in January 2017 by two boy racers who are now serving jail sentences. Joan’s fellow band members wanted to do something to honour her memory and decided to organise a concert featuring all three bands which she had played for. Kilmarnock Concert Brass, Irvine \u0026amp Dreghorn Brass Band and Dunaskin Doon Band will join together on September 1 to pay tribute to the Troon gran. The brass band show will now be an annual event, with each band taking it in turns to nominate a charity. This year Kilmarnock Concert Brass has chosen Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO) as the worthy recipients. Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO) supports bereaved families of suicide victims and any troubled person by providing and funding services such as counselling, music, play and drama therapy.  The charity was set up by mum, Pauline Moriarty, originally from Ayr, following the suicide of her 13-year-old daughter, Jenna. The concert will honour Joan and Jenna with traditional marches, big band hits, movie themes and film scores. Tasty treats and a raffle will be on offer during the interval. Colin, Joan’s husband said: “Our family is delighted and honoured that the three bands have decided to make this concert an annual event in Joan’s memory. A lot of hard work goes on behind the scenes to make a concert like this happen and I’m indebted to everyone who has helped or who is playing on the night. “Last year’s concert was a fantastic night of entertainment and I’m looking forward to meeting many old and new friends again this year.” Pauline Moriarty added: “We are so touched the bands have chosen to raise funds for the work of a Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO). It is such a lovely tribute to Joan Price and it will help us to potentially save lives.” Joan Price Memorial Concert will take place on Saturday, September 1 at 7pm at Kyle Academy on Overmills Road in Ayr. Tickets, \u0026pound7 (under 12s and over 65s \u0026pound5) are available by emailing secretary@ddband or messaging Dunaskin Doon Band on their Facebook page. A limited number of tickets will also be available on the night.

Fraser and Freya Russell have qualified for the National final of the American Golf Junior Golf Championships. The pair, who live in Troon and attend Marr College, progressed from the qualifying competition held at Leven Links Golf Club and now go forward to the final which will be televised on Sky Sports later this year. Competing in the gross score stroke play competition, 14-year-old Fraser, who incredibly plays off a five handicap at Royal Troon, put in a superb performance to take the qualifier with a score of nine over par. Not to be outdone by her older brother, Freya, 12, put in a fantastic performance to score 32 points in a stableford off a handicap of 13 in the girls’ net score competition. That was enough to take top spot and secure a spot in the final at Gainsborough Golf Club, where she will take on the UK and Ireland’s best girls. Speaking after the qualifier, Fraser said: “I am delighted with how I played, it will be a great chance for me to play golf on a good stage and I can test myself against some of the best.”  And younger sister Freya is looking forward to the continuing her golfing journey as she commented: “I love to play different golf courses, meeting new friends and getting to play golf with other girl golfers.” The pair play their junior medals on the Portland Course at Royal Troon, but due to their impressive handicaps they are allowed to enter in competitions that are played on the par 71 Old Course. They are both coached by Royal Troon pro Kieron Stevenson. Both Fraser and Freya represent Ayrshire for their age levels, and Freya has been playing with the West of Scotland U18 team since she was just nine. And they both played in the World Championships at the stunning Pinehurst course, which held both the men’s and women’s US Open just a year later - won respectively by Martin Kaymer and Michelle Wie.  Pinehurst has also been pencilled in for the 2019 US Amateur Championships and the 2024 US Open. The pair’s dad, Craig, has always played golf and he helped get them into the sport. Craig, who played golf for Cambridge University, said: “They have always been interested in golf. “I took Fraser to play at a young age, and Freya’s first steps were when she got up to pick up her brother’s golf club! “I’ve never forced it on them though, anytime they play golf it’s because they want to, which I think is the key. “They aren’t just into golf though, Fraser plays rugby for Marr and Freya wants to play hockey for her school, and both of them swim.” "},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-young-would-be-politicians-to-make-a-difference","story":"YOUNG Borderers with a passion for politics are being urged to register their interest for next year\u0026rsquos Scottish Youth Parliament elections.\nThe elections are due to take place in March and those aged between 14 and 25 are eligible to stand.\nThe democratically-elected Scottish Youth Parliament (SYP) aims to give Scotland\u0026rsquos youngsters a voice.\nWith the decision makers of Scotland taking notice, it allows young people to campaign on the issues which they feel matter most.\nThere are three Scottish Borders MYSPs, elected by their peers.

maximisation of benefit entitlement in the Borders and to \u0026ldquoacknowledge the error made in not carrying out any public consultation on the restructure.\nThe author of the petition and chair of the Borders mental health forum, Jenny Mushlin, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom very concerned that at a time when the benefits system has become so complicated the council has changed its service.\n\u0026ldquoThere are now fewer welfare officers and they are all working across different services.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom hoping this petition will give some understanding to councillors

It was nailed to the stretcher rather than the modern method of stapling. At some stage a further bar of yellowed wood had to added to keep the canvas taut.Further internet research revealed a painter known as H Shapiro, who was born in 1933. Helen was born in 1946.Unfortunately for those hoping for a massive price tag, the H stands variously for Hermon or Herman.A painting with a similar style, titled Loch Long, appeared recently on eBay and was described as: ‘Oil on canvas, possibly an early work by the artist Herman (Hermon) Shapiro.‘It is hand signed, lower right, with “H. Shapiro” and dated ‘52 (1952).’A large collection of Mr Shapiro’s other work, mainly of life studies of a distinctly different style is for sale with a gallery, named Hatfield Hines in Norwich.One of the partners at the gallery said they had bought the paintings. Despite having much biographical detail the partner claimed they had no way of contacting Mr Shapiro.That gallery states that Mr Shapiro was born in London and is settled in Scotland, which fits Clachan’s picture.He studied at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts from 1949-54 where he was apparently influenced by Bloch, Minton and Vaughan and was associated with the acclaimed Camberwell Group.By the mid 1950s he had started teaching in South Wales schools and went on to lecture at Cardiff College of Art.His paintings and sculpture are mostly based on the female figure, more recently in a domestic environment.

Despite two days and a night of rain last week the water level remains well down.The dam is crossed to reach the track to Whitehill farm, which is derelict, and on to the Ballywilline lane and the route\u0026#8217s end at the A83 pavement.In an emergency the simplest descent from the summit would be south-east, leading to a dip and due west to the Knocknan loch track and the Balegreggan waterworks.No doubt hill runners will race up Knock Scalbert but stout boots, a waterproof, picnic and a drink would make for an enjoyable walk, plus a map and compass, and the ability to use them.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"Festival guests left feeling cheesed off call for a refund","story":"  The Big Cheese Festival, which was held at Hove Lawns yesterday, has been branded a \"shocking experience\" by\u0026nbspguests, with some saying they counted no more than two cheese stalls.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.  The seven new citizens who attended were: Christa Gerdwilker (originally from Germany), East Saltoun Mohamed Sherif (Libya), Musselburgh Carmen King (Mexico), Ormiston Bernadette Fitzgerald (Australia), Tranent Diego Onate (Colombia), East Saltoun Gabriele Hegerl (Germany), East Linton John Crowley (USA), East Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-bath-in-butterdean-wood","story":"  BEING surrounded by trees, in a wood where the world outside cannot be seen, is a primeval experience. It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-bmx-club-needs-helpers-today","story":"  An appeal on the club\u0027s Facebook page said: \"We are looking for a small army of volunteers to help finishing off the BMX track this Sunday from 10am.  \"This is a race standard track that will serve the cycling community of the Lothians for years to come and it has plenty to offer all levels of cyclists.  \"The layout with the heavy machinery is all done and now the manual surfacing is ready to go.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

Similarly, we\u0026rsquore very keen for any Courier readers to get in touch with us to give us details of their time at The Bluebell.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe majority of the current squad is made up from lads who have spent between five to 15 years playing youth football at Musselburgh Windsor.  \u0026ldquoThis band of brothers are excited at this new attempt to revive The Bluebell and would love to see some of the ex-players along to shout them on.  \u0026ldquoWe will be attempting to play all our home games at Wallyford playing fields, normally with a 2pm kick-off.  \u0026ldquoSo far we have played a few of the East Lothian sides in some friendlies and won every game.  The team played its final friendly match of the season last Sunday, ending in a 2-2 draw against Easthouses.  A race night at Wallyford Miners Welfare Society \u0026amp Social Club has already raised \u0026pound1,000 for funds, with sponsorship for home and away strips coming from local businesses Michael Moffat of Platinum Plumbing and Heating Svs and Callum Innes Electrical Solutions.

That has led to questions being asked as to how the current doctors\u0026rsquo surgery, on Newton Port, will cope with the increase in people.  Fiona-Frances Adam, one of the town\u0026rsquos community councillors, raised the issue with councillors.  She asked: \u0026ldquoWhat are they going to be doing?  \u0026ldquoAre they going to extend the surgery with all the incoming people?  \u0026ldquoThey are stretched.  Land was previously earmarked for a new doctors\u0026rsquo surgery to be created on the site of the new East Lothian Community Hospital, which is currently being built on the site of the former Roodlands Hospital.  The new hospital is expected to be complete in 2020 but no planning application has been submitted for a GP surgery at any site in the town, including the hospital and within the new Letham Mains development, which is sandwiched between the B6471 and the A6093.  Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership told the Courier that discussions had been taking place with Haddington GPs on how to support the growing population for \u0026ldquosome time.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe new housing is phased, which enables us to plan ahead.  \u0026ldquoAt the moment we are still looking at a range of options.  \u0026ldquoOf course, the focus on greater multi-disciplinary working coming in now with the new GP contract will allow patients much greater flexibility and swifter access to the right clinical professional at surgeries and other local settings.  Provost John McMillan, a councillor for Haddington and Lammermuir ward, said planning the development of any future health facility had to be carefully weighed up.  Mr McMillan also noted the variety of services which would be included within the new \u0026pound70 million hospital.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is the same issues around working with a town that has got a good town square and you need to look at car parking.  \u0026ldquoWe are looking at that in a measured way and working in partnership.  \u0026ldquoIt is the same with families with young children coming in and an ageing population.  \u0026ldquoYou have to look at schools and the health service as well."},{"url":null,"title":"pear-tree-nursery-set-to-create-up-to-30-jobs-in-haddington","story":"  Pear Tree Nursery has opened a second facility in the town in a former bed and breakfast on West Road.  The new nursery, which saw more than 200 interested parents attend its open day last month, could employ up to 30 staff when it is at capacity, with six already recruited.  Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe wanted a second site because of the waiting list we had at Meadowpark and were delighted to be able to take on the former B\u0026ampB on West Road.  \u0026ldquoOur open day showed how much nursery places are in demand and with all the new houses being built we knew there was a need for it.  \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have a second nursery in Haddington.

He said: \u0026ldquoPear Tree Nursery has been doing a great job for many Haddington families in recent years \u0026ndash including my own grandsons.

This is a beautiful building and it has been fitted out to provide the best of care. Not only will it increase the availability of childcare, but it will create a significant number of new jobs in the town too.  \u0026ldquoThis is now a highly qualified and professional sector, and Pear Tree has a great track record on staff support and training, so these are excellent opportunities for local people.  \u0026ldquoWith childcare entitlement expanding and Haddington also increasing in size, this is a much-needed and welcome facility."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

If approved, the merger would follow the expected merger of Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, which have Jacqui McKinnon, headteacher at Cockenzie Primary School, as interim headteacher until their formal merger goes ahead.  According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.  He said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased about it because that is what essentially the research carried out by the community council demonstrated. There was public support for it in Dunbar and it will be good to see it going ahead and I am hopeful the outcome will be positive.  Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe order has been made and we are just awaiting the appropriate signage, which should be within the next month.  \u0026ldquoThe order will be for an 18-month period and is an experimental order.  If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals (Trussell Trust stats).  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent (April 16 to March 17 was 37 per cent increase).  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a variety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010.

She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform (although hair still looking slightly wild as she likes it), she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to (literally) beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most.

He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.  Following their \u0026pound1,000 win for their successful application as part of the Royal Bank RugbyForce initiative, delivered in partnership with Scottish Rugby, Haddington\u0026rsquos event organisers will now submit evidence of the record for verification from Guinness World Records.  Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington. Mr Wallace said: \u0026ldquoIt made a huge difference \u0026ndash the kids loved seeing them and they were great."},{"url":null,"title":"new-headteacher-wants-to-make-knox-academy-a-flagship-school-for-east-lothian","story":"  Susan Cook took charge at the Haddington school this week after moving from Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Trinity Academy, where she was acting headteacher.  Pupils returned on Wednesday, with Ms Cook planning a series of assemblies to introduce herself to the students.  She said: \u0026ldquoI would like to make Knox Academy a flagship school in East Lothian \u0026ndash Scotland, potentially.  \u0026ldquoI want all young people to leave to a positive destination but be healthy and happy as they move through the school and really enjoy their school experience.  \u0026ldquoI want pupils to enjoy education in the widest sense, not just the curriculum but wider activities, and to develop as rounded individuals when they leave school to meet the demands of an ever-changing society.  Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe staff seem fantastic, a creative group of people. They really are keen for the school to engage with the challenge.  Ms Cook has also vowed not to remain in her office at the school but instead wants to get out and about and speak to the pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoI found when I was at Trinity Academy, the headteacher and the senior leadership team were in the middle of the school. With an open foyer, you saw pupils pass.  \u0026ldquoI think it could be easy to shut the door and stay in the room. That is not what I want to do, I want to get out and about.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot really like sitting about, I want to engage with people. That is the best way to learn what makes the school tick, the young people and the staff tick.

She said: \u0026ldquoI absolutely love the school.  \u0026ldquoLots of people say it about Dunbar, that it is a really special community.  \u0026ldquoThere is really something quite magical about the school and the community.  \u0026ldquoThe youngsters here are just tremendous and the friendliness you get from young people and staff \u0026ndash it is a really caring place.  Currently the school is undergoing a large-scale expansion, which is due to be fully complete in early November.  Ahead of the new term starting, a section of the extension has been opened, which will give access to six new classrooms.  More than \u0026pound10 million is being spent on the extension, which includes a new two-storey L-shaped block to the east side of the school.  It will not only be home to new classrooms but also a home economics department, new library and learning centre with a dedicated IT space, and additional PE changing rooms.  Mrs Slowther, who has previously worked at both Knox Academy in Haddington and Ross High School, Tranent, felt it was a \u0026ldquophenomenally exciting time for the school.  The 36-year-old, who is joined by Ed Offer and Richard Maxton as depute headteachers, as well as Suzanne Hamilton as acting depute headteacher, said staff were taking the school into a new era.  The new headteacher, who was previously a biology teacher, added staff had talked about what they could do \u0026ldquoto preserve what is really special and how we continue delivering absolutely the best education for every young person that comes through our doors.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe call it Sunny Dunny. It is a sunny, cheerful, caring place \u0026ndash within the classrooms, corridors and out in the community.  \u0026ldquoWhen parents come in, they are so friendly and supportive as well.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"whats-on-this-weekend-five-ideas-of-things-to-do-in-east-lothian","story":"  1.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.  The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council (NBCC) contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed. The pipe was clearly visible in the aftermath of storms in December 2010 and it took many, many months before the tides re-covered it with sand."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.  The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.

He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes. He plays sport too, so he was asking about my injury and about judo.  \u0026ldquoI just asked him about Love Island, and what life was like after the villa.  \u0026ldquoHe said that he had a gut feeling he was going to leave, and that they all shared clothes and had a laugh.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.

He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5 (accumulate) this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent (12 per cent more than last year and the highest value in four years).  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"military-exercise-to-take-place-near-north-berwick","story":"  The exercise, run by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), takes place between September 3 and 21 at Gin Head, the former Second World War radar site at Tantallon, to the east of the town.

With the reverberations of a litany of clerical sex crimes casting a shadow over the first papal visit to Ireland in almost 40 years, Francis acknowledged the gravity of what had happened.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the most vulnerable, I cannot fail to acknowledge the grave scandal caused in Ireland by the abuse of young people by members of the church charged with responsibility for their protection and education, he said.  \u0026ldquoThe failure of ecclesiastical authorities \u0026ndash bishops, religious superiors, priests and others \u0026ndash adequately to address these repellent crimes has rightly given rise to outrage and remains a source of pain and shame for the Catholic community.  \u0026ldquoI myself share those sentiments.  On Saturday, the Pope also visited homeless people who receive support from a centre run by the Capuchin Fathers\u0026rsquo religious order.  In his Dublin Castle speech, the pontiff also expressed hope that remaining obstacles to reconciliation in Northern Ireland could be overcome.  Ireland has undergone seismic social changes in the four decades since the last papal visit in 1979, when John Paul II was lauded by a nation shaped by its relationship with an all-powerful Catholic Church.  But the church\u0026rsquos response to clerical sex abuse scandals, most of which emerged years after John Paul II\u0026rsquos visit, have severely damaged trust in the religious institution and seriously weakened its influence on Irish society.  While thousands lined the streets of the capital to catch a glimpse of Francis passing in his famous Popemobile on Saturday afternoon, the crowds were certainly not on the scale witnessed when John Paul II made a similar trip.  And among the well-wishers lining Dublin\u0026rsquos streets there were also protesters, who vented their anger at the pontiff as he drove by."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8434961.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"what-is-the-knock-shrine","story":"  Maria Casey, marketing and communications manager at Knock Shrine, explains the meaning behind the pilgrimage site.  \u0026ldquoKnock Shrine is a special place in Co Mayo in the west of Ireland because of the apparition that took place here in 1879.

The investigation is into two complaints of incidents alleged to have taken place at Bute House, the First Minister\u0026rsquos official residence in 2013.  Ms Sturgeon said she agreed to the procedure covering ministers and former ministers in December 2017 but that while she was aware of the investigation she had no role in it.  Ms Sturgeon said that she was initially made aware of the investigation by Mr Salmond himself.  She said: \u0026ldquoAlthough I have been aware for some time of the fact of the investigation \u0026ndash initially from Alex Salmond \u0026ndash I have had no role in the process, and to have referred to it before now would have compromised the integrity of the internal investigation, which I was not prepared to do.  \u0026ldquoHowever, I was informed by the Permanent Secretary earlier this week that she had completed her investigation and that she intended to make the fact of the complaints public.  \u0026ldquoAlex Salmond is now challenging the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedure in court. The Scottish Government refutes his criticisms of its process and will defend its position vigorously.  \u0026ldquoHowever, this focus on process cannot deflect from the fact that complaints were made that could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.  The First minister said here relationship with Mr Salmond, who she has previously described as a mentor, makes it difficult to deal with but that people must feel able to make complaints.  She added: \u0026ldquoI have been clear on many occasions that all organisations and workplaces must make it possible for people to come forward to report concerns and have confidence that they will be treated seriously.  \u0026ldquoFor that principle to mean anything it cannot be applied selectively. It must be applied without fear or favour, regardless of the identity, seniority or political allegiance of the person involved.  Mr Salmond denied the allegations and was taking action against the Scottish Government claiming he was denied the opportunity to refute them.  He said the claims which date back to 2013 were \u0026ldquopatently ridiculous and said the investigation was \u0026ldquounjust."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-under-pressure-to-suspend-alex-salmond-amid-allegations","story":"  Mr Salmond repeatedly denied criminal behaviour and insisted he has never sexually harassed anyone as he battled to save his reputation following explosive claims dating back to his time as First Minister.  It came as it emerged Ms Sturgeon refused to intervene in the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos internal investigation when Mr Salmond told her about the allegations earlier this year.  She said the claims were \u0026ldquoextremely difficult to come to terms with but could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.  An internal Government probe was launched in January after two staff members complained of sexual misconduct by Mr Salmond at Bute House in December 2013, when he was First Minister.  In an extraordinary day for Scottish politics, Mr Salmond revealed he met Ms Sturgeon three times after being told of the claims, during which he raised concerns about the \u0026ldquofundamentally flawed investigation into his behaviour.  Ms Sturgeon said she had \u0026ldquomade very clear she would not intervene.  The former First Minister is now taking the Scottish Government to court over its handling of the complaints process, and has demanded an inquiry into how details were leaked to a newspaper.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos shadow equalities secretary Monica Lennon said: \u0026ldquoGiven the serious nature of these allegations, it would be appropriate that the SNP suspends Alex Salmond\u0027s membership of the party with immediate effect.  In a statement released on Thursday night, Mr Salmond accused the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, of carrying out a \u0026ldquogrossly unfair investigation into the claims, branding some of them \u0026ldquopatently ridiculous.  But Ms Evans said his statement contained \u0026ldquosignificant inaccuracies. She also revealed Mr Salmond attempted to gag her from publicising the complaints by issuing legal proceedings.  Mr Salmond is now pursuing a judicial review of her probe, and insisted that if he wins \u0026ldquothere will be serious questions to answer at the top of government.  During a lengthy press conference, he refused to detail the nature of the allegations against him, whether he was anticipating more claims or whether complaints had previously been made about his behaviour as First Minister.  He also refused to say whether he had suggested to Ms Sturgeon that the Government\u0026rsquos investigation be dropped, instead answering: \u0026ldquoPrivate conversations as far as I\u0026rsquom concerned are private conversations.  \u0026ldquoWhat I would say is the very legitimate concerns, reservations, arguments about the nature of this, I have made to everybody at every possible opportunity.  Mr Salmond did not rule out suing Ms Evans or the Scottish Government for defamation after the current legal proceedings have finished.  He said he is \u0026ldquono saint and has made \u0026ldquomany mistakes in my life \u0026ndash political and personal, but denied sexual harassment or criminality.  The former politician said his family and friends \u0026ndash including his wife of almost four decades, Moira \u0026ndash had been \u0026ldquoincredibly supportive.  He insisted it was made \u0026ldquoexplicit to him when the Scottish Government launched its probe that it would be \u0026ldquototally confidential. But this was breached, he argued, when Ms Evans told him on Wednesday afternoon that she was making the claims public.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos only through a fair process that you can get a fair result. In the procedure of the Scottish Government, I had no access to evidence, witness statements. I was denied the right to speak to any serving civil servant.  Asked if he thought he would be suspended from the SNP, Mr Salmond said: \u0026ldquoI would advise everybody to suspend judgment until the court can make a judgment.  He said he did his \u0026ldquoabsolute best to cooperate with the civil service investigation, but had only seen a summary of the complaints against him and was not told the identity of the alleged victims.  But he insisted he was not seeking any sympathy. He said: \u0026ldquoIf I lose at the Court of Session then as I said, I\u0026rsquoll have to answer the complaints openly and publicly and I\u0026rsquoll do that as far as I\u0026rsquom able, with confidentiality and all that.  \u0026ldquoBut I don\u0026rsquot expect to lose. I expect to win. And that will have serious implications for the top administrators in the Scottish Government, but it might have beneficial consequences for a better process in the future.  Ms Sturgeon said Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos membership of the SNP would be \u0026ldquoconsidered in the fullness of time as more information became available.  A police spokesman said: \"We are carrying out an assessment of information which we have received and enquiries are at an early stage."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-holds-first-national-assembly-to-debate-new-independence-blueprint","story":"  The national assembly meeting was held in Ayr, South Ayrshire, on Saturday to gather party members\u0027 views on the findings of the Growth Commission, published in May.  Two further national assemblies are due to take place in Aviemore in the Highlands and Edinburgh next month, ahead of the SNP\u0027s autumn conference in October.  SNP depute leader Keith Brown, chair of the assemblies, said: \"I\u0027m delighted that the first national assembly event attracted so many people and generated such a range of positive ideas and contributions on the sustainable growth commission report.  \"This is so valuable as we build a fresh case for an independent Scotland.\"  The Growth Commission, set up by Nicola Sturgeon and chaired by former SNP MSP Andrew Wilson, set out a series of recommendations for the economy in an independent Scotland.  Its proposals include keeping Sterling without a formal currency union after Scotland leaves the UK.  A separate Scottish currency could be set up after a period of about a decade, but only if six key economic tests were met, the commission said.  The move would see the Bank of England continue to set interest rates and other monetary policy in the years after independence.  The commission also said it would take 10 years to get Scotland\u0027s deficit rate under control while an independent Scotland would take up to 25 years to match the economic performance of other small countries such as Denmark, Sweden, Norway and New Zealand.  The First Minister has insisted the report sets out an alternative to Westminster\u0027s \"austerity\" but the document has been criticised by some Yes supporters.  Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland ahead of the meeting in Ayr, Mr Brown said the commission had presented a \"very realistic hard-headed approach\", but he added \"of course it may be the case that members of the party have a different point of view and that\u0027s why we\u0027re having these national assemblies\".  Challenged on some members\u0027 objections to retaining Sterling, Mr Brown added: \"I can say from the meetings I\u0027ve had so far, there are some views along those lines in terms of the currency - people not happy with sticking with the pound for that period of time.  \"But that would be a minority in the discussions I\u0027ve had so far, and we\u0027ll find out what the strength of feeling is (at the national assembly).\""},{"url":null,"title":"vicky-allan-argento-allegations-say-its-time-for-mentoo","story":"  The then 37-year-old had also, it was revealed, paid the actor off to the sum of around \u0026pound300,000. Although she issued a denial that sex had taken place, photographs emerged which appeared to show them lying together.  A story like this was probably bound to hit #MeToo at some point. Indeed, the movement has already had its debate over what our reaction should be if a #MeToo victim looks to also be an abuser, when Junot Diaz, after writing of his childhood abuse, was accused of sexual misconduct himself.  But the impact of the Argento allegations is different \u0026ndash for she has been such a key icon of the movement. An early accuser of Harvey Weinstein, she once threatened other abusers: \u0026ldquoWe know who you are, and we are not going to allow you to get away with it any longer.  Personally, I don\u0026rsquot think this is a bad moment for #MeToo. This is where the movement has to come of age, to acknowledge complexity, take in male survivors, and shift its image away from being a movement for a female celebrity elite. Where it goes from here is dependent on how it frames the problem of Argento, and its ability to remind the world that it is a movement not of flawed and complex leaders, but about principles. That hasn\u0026rsquot happened yet.  What do we do with a problem like Argento? The accusations against her do need to be taken seriously. They\u0026rsquore also a reminder that we need to look at the way women too may abuse their power. She was, notably, his director and co-star when he was seven.  Does that mean I believe Jimmy Bennett and not Asia Argento? I certainly don\u0026rsquot disbelieve him. The #MeToo credo has always been to believe the accuser. That has never, it has seemed to me, been what\u0026rsquos most important. What, above all, we owe victims is not to discredit them.  Yet Argento \u0026ndash unsurprisingly given she is the accused, yet hypocritically given she is #MeToo \u0026ndash has discredited Bennett, impugning him as a grifter, out for the money. It is this that has been hardest to square.  Not only that but, on social media, we see Bennett discredited by the public mob, just as we have seen so many female accusers discredited, including Argento. The tone is not quite the same, but there are similarities. He is cast as a gold-digger, someone who really wanted the sex \u0026ndash for after all what 17-year-old boy, so the story goes, wouldn\u0026rsquot? Stereotypes about young male sexual appetites abound.  What the Asia Argento story is a reminder of is that the question of who is a victim, who is a perpetrator, who is a survivor, who is an abuser of power, isn\u0026rsquot a matter of identity, but of relations. A person can be at one point in their lives a victim, and another an abuser. That\u0026rsquos the case, regardless of whether you are male or female \u0026ndash we all start out as powerless children.  The problem is the #MeToo movement failed, up till now, to embrace male survivors sufficiently. It was always a little \u0026ldquonot you too. There was always, and I was probably guilty of it myself, a tendency to use the word \u0026ldquoher too much, to frame the cause as a female issue.  But it\u0026rsquos possible for a movement like #MeToo to be about both Asia Argento as victim, and also Jimmy Bennett too. It can contain both. Dealing with that, and many other difficult questions, is key to its evolution.  Leave no stone turned ...  ENOUGH. I\u0026rsquom done with my long, adventurous career as an international beach pebble thief. No longer will I collect small cairns for my bathroom shelves. Nor am I going to continue to lead my children into this life of squalid crime. This, by the way, is not merely triggered by last week\u0026rsquos news story of how a man, threatened with prosecution for stealing stones from a Cornish beach had driven back to return them. Nor is it because I\u0026rsquove only just realised that under the Coast Protection Act1949, this is a crime. I actually quit long ago.  I suspect we\u0026rsquove all stone-thieved at some point. I think of it as one of our early instincts \u0026ndash the finding of a really good stone that fits perfectly into the palm of the hand. But, in these acquisitive times, it\u0026rsquos not just one nice stone, it\u0026rsquos a whole pocketful, or a bag, and then it gets out of control and your yard is like a shingle beach.  Now, there\u0026rsquos nothing really wrong with your small home cairn, but we do have a knack for turning beautiful things into stuff. Plus there are hordes of us \u0026ndash tourists, they call us \u0026ndash at it.  The stone that was a thing of beauty on the beach too often becomes a bit of clutter around the house. I know the temptation. I have it every time I visit the beach. Stone gathering is irresistible.  But then I look at my treasured pile and think to myself \u0026ldquobetter just leave it, they look loveliest here."},{"url":null,"title":"stuc-in-firing-line-over-relying-on-snp-government-for-60-of-funding","story":"  Leaked documents show that the STUC, which speaks for nearly 500,000 workers, received around 60 per cent of its income from Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos Government last year.  The \u0026pound2.6 million in public funding far exceeds the sum paid to the STUC in fees from its own members.  Meanwhile, the GMB union, one of the umbrella group\u0026rsquos biggest members, said in a statement that they had raised concerns about \u0026ldquotransparency and accountability in the running of the STUC.  Founded in 1897, the Glasgow-based STUC acts as the voice of the trade union movement and lobbies Government for policy changes. It represents the interests of members in 39 unions and 20 trades union councils, and is financed by affiliation fees.  Although the STUC is not aligned to a political party, the body had a high-profile role promoting devolution in the 1980s and 1990s.  However, senior trade union figures told this newspaper that the STUC, led by general secretary Grahame Smith, was too reliant on the Scottish Government and had lost its way.  The STUC is now facing questions about its relationship with the Government and the financial model on which the organisation is based.  Unlike the TUC \u0026ndash its UK sister organisation \u0026ndash the STUC is under no obligation to make its annual financial statements available outwith affiliated unions.  A spin-off firm, STUC Training Ltd, publishes accounts, but a detailed picture of the income of the body is not in the public domain.  According to documents presented to the annual congress in Aviemore this year, the STUC and its training arm had a combined income of around \u0026pound4.3m in 2017. Of this sum, less than 25 per cent came in the form of affiliation fees from trade unionists.  The biggest chunk of cash, \u0026pound2.3m, was given to STUC Training Ltd by the SNP Government for the \u0026ldquoScottish Union Learning initiative, which promotes skills and lifelong learning. Funds through the scheme are provided to the STUC, which distributes resources for different projects to help union members.  Another budget line also shows that the STUC received \u0026pound324,440 from the Government for the \u0026ldquoUnion Modernisation Fund.  This new pot was announced by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as a way of mitigating what she described as Tory legislation that \u0026ldquothreatens the unions. For every pound received by the STUC in 2017, around 60p came from the SNP Government, whose policies the civic body attempts to influence.  One critic of Smith\u0026rsquos leadership said the STUC had offered occasional criticism of the SNP Government, such as questioning rates relief for small business.  However, Smith is a member of the First Minister\u0026rsquos Standing Council on Europe and he backed the SNP Government position in the row over a Brexit \u0026ldquopower grab of Holyrood powers. The STUC also provided a mild quote in response to the findings of the SNP Growth Commission, a report that was widely criticised by figures on the political Left.  Liberal Democrat MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton said: \u0026ldquoThe trade union movement is a vital part of public life and the defence of workers\u0026rsquo rights. They should always be utterly independent both of management and of Government. So to learn that the STUC gets the majority of funding from the Scottish Government puts that independence into question.  \u0026ldquoThey should be a champion for trade unions and of working people above all things, but many have been concerned that they have seemed to have pulled their punches recently over criticising the SNP Government on things like the austerity proposed by the Growth Commission.  Scottish Tory MSP Bill Bowman said: \u0026ldquoThe STUC is curiously quiet when it comes to criticising the Scottish Government.  \"Perhaps it\u0026rsquos a case of not biting the hand that feeds you.  \u0026ldquoIf the SNP Government is bankrolling the STUC, that explains why the organisation is so reluctant to question SNP decisions. No such problem seems to exist in relation to the UK Government.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a blatant conflict of interest here, and one which raises serious questions about the STUC\u0026rsquos ability to function transparently and responsibly.  A senior trade union figure said: \u0026ldquoThis is a serious situation for the STUC. Relying on external funding from the Scottish Government not only undermines the future sustainability of the organisation, it places a significant question mark over their ability to scrutinise and challenge Scottish Government policy making.  Separately, the STUC also faced criticism after an employment tribunal ruled that a staff member had been victimised by selecting him for redundancy.  The STUC failed to have the ruling overturned in an appeal and is in line for a hefty legal bill.  The Sunday Herald asked some of the STUC\u0026rsquos biggest affiliates for a comment on the tribunal case, but most did not provide a comment.  However, a spokesperson for GMB Scotland, one of the country\u0026rsquos biggest unions, said: \u0026ldquoThe judgment is troubling \u0026ndash victimisation in the workplace isn\u0026rsquot acceptable.  The statement added: \u0026ldquoOn numerous occasions we have raised our concerns about transparency and accountability in the running of the STUC, to defend the jobs and conditions of the staff we represent within the STUC and for the organisation\u0026rsquos ability to campaign effectively on behalf of all its affiliate members in future.  \u0026ldquoGMB Scotland will continue to seek to address those concerns through the internal processes of the STUC.  An STUC spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe funds received by the STUC from the Scottish Government are to fund learning and development projects run by our affiliated unions that provide learning opportunities for over 9,000 trade union members every year.  \u0026ldquoThese projects make a significant contribution to upskilling and reskilling the workforce and to our shared objective with the Scottish Government of achieving a more inclusive economy.  \u0026ldquoThe STUC is not dependent on Scottish Government funding. If this funding was not provided, thousands of low-paid, low-skilled workers would be deprived of the opportunity for personal and professional development.  On the GMB criticism, the spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThere are multiple opportunities available to all of our affiliates to ensure we remain transparent and accountable, principally our Annual Congress which elects and holds to account our General Council on which members of the GMB serve.  \u0026ldquoConcerns raised by the GMB, which align with the specific issues mentioned above, have already been addressed directly with its Scottish secretary."},{"url":null,"title":"just-how-welcome-are-muslims-in-scotland","story":"  In cities like Glasgow, Islam has long been a prominent part of society. Scotland\u0026rsquos first mosque was opened in Glasgow\u0026rsquos Oxford Street in 1944 and Sandymount Cemetery became the first burial site for the interment of Muslims around the same period. Since then, thousands of Muslims from the likes of Pakistan and the Middle East have called Glasgow, and elsewhere in Scotland, home.  Earlier this month, Detective Chief Superintendent Gerry McLean, head of Police Scotland\u0026rsquos organised crime and counterterrorism unit, claimed that Muslims tended to feel more integrated north of the Border than elsewhere in Britain \u0026ndash which was why Scotland had largely avoided any Islamist-inspired terrorist attacks.  Indeed, as London and Manchester have been left reeling from atrocities carried out in the name of Islam in recent years, the last act of (Islamist) terrorism to visit Scottish shores was the attack on Glasgow Airport in 2007. Then, an SUV laden with propane gas cylinders and petrol containers sped towards the airport\u0026rsquos departure hall, but was halted by a concrete pillar at the main entrance. Fortunately, only five bystanders were injured \u0026ndash none seriously.  The 2011 census counted some 77,000 Muslim adherents in Scotland \u0026ndash up from 43,000 in 2001. And, insofar as McLean\u0026rsquos words hold true, generations of Muslims in Scotland can share a story of integration, success and a rejection of Islamist terrorism that has blighted other parts of the UK.  Mohammad Asif arrived in Scotland from the horrors of the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2000 and made Glasgow his home. Asif, who today is chair of the Scottish Afghan Society, told the Sunday Herald he felt \u0026ldquolucky to end up in Scotland. \u0026ldquoYes, initially, there were a lot of problems \u0026ndash people didn\u0026rsquot understand why asylum seekers were coming to their neighbourhood and there was misinformation by the right-wing media, said the 50-year-old. \u0026ldquoBut whichever Scottish Government has been in power \u0026ndash especially the SNP Government \u0026ndash has always been supportive of asylum seekers and refugees.  Asif added that while Conservative MP Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos incendiary remarks about some Muslim women earlier this month caused Westminster to resound to accusations of Islamophobia, Scotland\u0026rsquos political climate has long fostered a greater sense of inclusion for the nation\u0026rsquos Muslims.  \u0026ldquoI saw someone say in England that the moment Boris Johnson opens his mouth, there is a rise in Islamophobia and racism, he said. \u0026ldquoLuckily, in Scotland, we don\u0026rsquot have these sort of politicians.  Miles from Scotland\u0026rsquos central belt, and away from the political fray, evidence of Scotland\u0026rsquos Muslim integration can be found in the Outer Hebrides \u0026ndash or the Western Isles. Here, just a few short months ago, the UK\u0026rsquos northernmost mosque opened in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis to accommodate the area\u0026rsquos tiny Muslim population.  The Sunday Herald caught up with Miriam Amjad, who was born and raised in Stornoway, as she prepared to celebrate Eid. \u0026ldquoThe mosque is a gift \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore so very happy with it, said the 60-year-old, who is the daughter of one of the first Muslim settlers in the Outer Hebrides. \u0026ldquoFrom my own point of view, I\u0026rsquom just delighted we have a little masjid [Arabic for mosque].  For Amjad, the mosque has been a long time coming. She recalled the many meetings and aborted attempts to raise money for a mosque in Stornoway as she was growing up. As she began to lose hope, action was taken that saw the project through to the end. Today, the mosque also serves the small number of Syrian families who have arrived in the Western Isles fleeing their war-torn homeland. While the breakaway Free Church of Scotland (Continuing) objected to the mosque\u0026rsquos establishment, the Western Isles\u0026rsquo long-held Christian tradition saw fit to welcome the masjid \u0026ndash much to Amjad\u0026rsquos delight.  \u0026ldquoThe day of the [mosque\u0026rsquos] opening said it all, stated Amjad, her soft Hebridean lilt belying her Asian background. \u0026ldquoThere just wasn\u0026rsquot any room to stand.  Academic research also gives credibility to a Muslim population at relative ease in Scotland. Stefano Bonino is a postdoctoral research fellow at Italy\u0026rsquos University of Trento, and author of Muslims in Scotland: The Making of Community in a Post-9/11 World (2016).  Bonino told the Sunday Herald that many factors have contributed to a Muslim sense of wellbeing in Scotland, and the country\u0026rsquos status as a low-level target for Islamist terrorists.  These include Scotland\u0026rsquos fairly small Muslim population as compared with England, the limited levels of ethnic segregation and the all-embracing nature of Scottish nationalism, which, unlike English nationalism, has espoused civic values. \u0026ldquoThere is also the division along sectarian lines between Protestants and Catholics \u0026ndash especially in Glasgow, added Bonino.  \u0026ldquoSo, the sectarian issue, in a way, displaced Islamophobia.  Yet, those who contend that Scotland\u0026rsquos tolerant reputation is more illusion than lived reality point to Glasgow\u0026rsquos dark tradition of Protestant-Catholic bigotry \u0026ndash and the nation\u0026rsquos own cases of Islamophobia, which have caused Muslim discontent and prompted integration concerns.  Cases of racial and Islamophobic hate crime, including racist daubing, are not an alien concept in Scotland: in May, a Syrian refugee in Edinburgh was stabbed and nearly killed in a racially-aggravated assault. Two of Scotland\u0026rsquos most prominent Muslim MSPs, Anas Sarwar of Labour, whose father was the first Muslim MP to be elected to the UK Parliament, and Humza Yousaf of the SNP, have also spoken of their own experiences of Islamophobia.  Scotland, say many observers, is not immune to the type of Islamophobic abuse that can lead to widespread Muslim grievance \u0026ndash and a breakdown of inter-community trust. And any notion that the nation\u0026rsquos Muslims were somehow isolated from the fanaticism of Isis was shattered when it was revealed that Aqsa Mahmood had left her Glasgow home at 19 to join the Islamist extremist group in Syria in 2013.  Saleem, 46, a white Scottish convert to Islam from Catholicism, who asked the Sunday Herald to withhold his surname, is from Edinburgh. The retailer, who stated that his experiences as a white male put him in a \u0026ldquoprivileged position, doubted claims that Scotland was somehow more at ease with its Muslim community than anywhere else in the UK. Saleem, who said he had been subjected to an Islamophic attack the one time he ventured out wearing a Muslim skullcap, opined that all today\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoMuslims were [subject to] distortion in the global media picture.  That said, Asif, a longstanding member of Scotland\u0026rsquos Muslim community, has embraced Glasgow. Like most people, he deplores the actions of the Taliban and Isis and the acts of Islamist terrorism perpetrated on British soil, and said that Scotland had given him and his family a home, opportunities \u0026ndash and a settled life. \u0026ldquoScotland is a very positive story for integration, he said. \u0026ldquoFor asylum seekers, refugees \u0026ndash and Muslims.  BOX:\u0026mdash  Terrorist incidents in Britain since 2005 include:  July 7, 2005: An Islamist attack in London sees bombs explode in the city\u0026rsquos transport network. It leaves 52 dead and injures hundreds more.  June 30, 2007: A Jeep is driven into the main terminal building at Glasgow Airport in an attempted Islamist suicide attack. Five people are hurt.

Such as taking a shower: we\u0026rsquore using both water and energy. Or setting off for the morning commute to work: we hope our train will be on time and that we have access to wifi (and coffee) to finish that all-important report we need for a 9am meeting. We are all dependent on services working seamlessly for us to support our busy and complex lives. So when things go wrong, what can we do?  Consumers need to be both aware of their rights and also confident enough to stand up for them. That\u0026rsquos why it\u0026rsquos critical for organisations like Citizens Advice Scotland and our wider CAB network to continue informing people of their rights, to work with public and private industries to represent the best interests of citizens, and where necessary, to push for improvements to the services they rely on.  Earlier this year we surveyed 40 of the companies that provide services across the three big regulated industries in Scotland: water, energy and post. We wanted to identify what frameworks these companies use, beyond claims or \u0026lsquobox ticking\u0026rsquo, to a public commitment to embed the interests of real people at the heart of their policy and practice. Though our findings suggested that some progress has been made towards being focused on what people really need, it was equally clear to us that more needs to be done.  So how do we change this, and ensure that service providers effectively support our busy lives to the standards that we all need?  At Citizens Advice Scotland we use a set of seven, internationally-recognised consumer focused principles (access, choice, safety, information, fairness, representation, redress). They help us assess new and existing policies and practices, and raise anything that may cause problems for consumers. We want to encourage every industry, service and business to use tools like these principles, to move away from thinking ABOUT consumers, and toward thinking LIKE consumers. That\u0026rsquos the real key to making sure services meet the needs of real people in a meaningful way.  Of course we recognise there are limits to a \u0026lsquoone size fits all\u0026rsquo set of principles \u0026ndash the actual frameworks used could be tailored to fit the unique situations and circumstances that characterise each sector. But although these principles aren\u0026rsquot a silver bullet, they are a robust tool that could be essential to improving life for everyone in Scotland.

Most rely on hyperbole and subterfuge. She formed it last March and two months later won a seat on East Ayrshire Council, pledging to clean up Irvine Valley of discarded litter and dog poo. Her slogan was \u0026ldquoVote Sally for a better Valley.  The one-woman party even won more seats, rather seat, than Ukip. Sally may be excellent at getting volunteers to litter pick, but she\u0026rsquos not great on social media, in fact she\u0026rsquos rubbish. Her website was impossible to access when I tried, several times during the week, throwing up a 404 error, whatever that is.  Nonetheless her efforts to clean up her town, Galston, still continue, although it looks like a Sisyphean task, from what I could see. Among the principal litter louts are pupils at Galston Academy who happily discard their crisp and fag packets, drug wraps and other junk as they walk from the town to school.  So bad is it that the council employs two scaffies to follow them every school day picking up their detritus. In these enlightened PC times we can no longer just box their ears.  DUCK ME, IT\u0026rsquoS AN ABOMINATION  Not content with burning down the poor man\u0026rsquos art school, twice, even more horror, contumely, disgrace and pure bad taste has been heaped upon Charles Rennie Mackintosh, this time by Glasgow City Council through its marketing arm Glasgow Life. Behold the Mackintosh Duck, or Quackintosh you might call it, sold at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery, which ought to know better.  This hideous, plastic monstrosity, priced ludicrously at \u0026pound6.99, is a floating, nodding insult to everything Mackintosh believed in, excellence, good design and innovation. This is a crime against art and history.  FLIPPIN\u0026rsquo HECK IT\u0026rsquoS THE REAL THING  Today sees the opening of the World Bog Snorkelling Championships where competitors swim or scrabble, twice, along a 60-yard muddy trench wearing flippers and a snorkel. This sounds exactly like the kind of S\u0026ampM event some unnamed celebrities (you know who you are ...) might enjoy.  International Rocket Week also starts today. Nominate your own contestant. Donald Trump is too easy. And this week marks the 125 anniversary of the invention of Pepsi, a decade and a bit after Coke, and still trying to catch up.  GREAT TOMORROW\u0026rsquoS WORLD FAILURES (1)  The long-running BBC show previewing the devices we\u0026rsquod be using in the future claimed that within a couple of years, and by now, we\u0026rsquod all be wearing paper underwear. That one was a load of pants.  THE GARDEN OF COSMIC DELIGHTS  Sadly I missed the one day a year the Garden of Cosmic Speculation is open. It was at the beginning of May, at Portrack House, near Dumfries. It\u0026rsquos a sculpture garden, the creation, over some 30 acres, of landscape architect and theorist Charles Jenks. From the pictures it looks amazing.  It\u0026rsquos inspired by science and mathematics, with 20 areas laid out as metaphors, such as the DNA garden, Quark Walk, Fractal terrace and Comet Bridge, and as well as the visual feast, apparently all the plants are edible.  The annual opening raises money for Maggie\u0026rsquos Centres, the cancer care charity named after Jencks\u0026rsquo late wife Maggie. Jencks, an American by birth, came up with the theory of post-modernism \u0026ndash no, I missed that too \u0026ndash and has written extensively about it.  The garden is near the place with the shortest place name in Britain, Ae, with around 200 inhabitants. According to one 19th century historian the villagers of Ae were \u0026ldquolong famed for broils, battles and feats of activity. Hopefully it has calmed down.  BRANSON AND THE NEW MEXICO PICKLE  Still on cosmic speculation there\u0026rsquos the sad case of the small New Mexico town of Truth or Consequences and Spaceport America, which was meant to be the base of Richard Branson\u0026rsquos Virgin Galactic \u0026ndash for $250,000 you could take a trip into space with his chief pilot, Helmsdale\u0026rsquos own Dave Mackay \u0026ndash but has turned into a multi-million dollar chimera. What was meant to host a thriving space industry and be a gateway to the stars has turned into a futurist tourist attraction, with a life-size replica of Virgin\u0026rsquos SpaceShipTwo (One was destroyed in the 2014 test flight) near to the company\u0026rsquos empty offices.  It was claimed to be the first purpose-built commercial spaceport on 18,000 acres of desert land, with Virgin the anchor tenant and although there have been some sub-orbital launches the facility is still an expensive white elephant and Branson has not shifted HQ from California.  In 2006, the then New Mexico governor Bill Richardson struck a deal with Branson to build the facility with Virgin Galactic\u0026rsquos headquarters there, which cost the state $220 million in public funds (with further subventions later). The place was meant to deliver $75m in taxes by 2029, but that looks a fond hope.  The wonderfully named Truth or Consequences, from where you travel to the spaceport, is in Sierra County, one of the poorest places in the US with more than one-in-four families below the poverty line. The town changed its name from Hot Springs in 1950, taking its new one, for some unfathomable reason, from a popular radio quiz show after the quizmaster vowed to broadcast once from any place that did. There\u0027s not much more truth to say about it. Bruce Springsteen mentions it in the song Last to Die, and part of an episode of Doctor Who was filmed there.  Virgin pilot Mackay\u0026rsquos ambition to become a spaceman was forged in the north of Scotland as a seven-year-old watching RAF pilots practising low flying over his home in Sutherland (while, no doubt, neighbours were complaining about the racket). He was one of the pilots involved in the fatal SpaceShipOne catastrophe, at the controls of the accompanying mother ship when it broke up in mid-air. Apparently, around 1,000 people, not put off, have signed up for Mackay to pilot them into space (if it ever happens). This clan member is not one of them."},{"url":null,"title":"two-motorbike-collisions-close-roads","story":"  Police shut the stretch of road between Ballinluig and Dunkeld, Perthshire, while they dealt with the incident.

Its proposals include keeping sterling without a formal currency union after Scotland leaves the UK.

These masochists should be warned however \u0026ndash healthypatriot\u0026rsquos pop-ups present breaking news in an eye-catching font so deliberately vulgar it may cause infertility, sparking the evolution of conciousness in individual sperm who refuse to seed a world where such horror exists.  So, hoping to spare myself the butchery of a conventional vasectomy, I valiantly ventured into the article to learn how coconut oil has \u0026ldquoalready helped 47,187 people prevent, stop and reverse their Alzheimer\u0026rsquos and dementia symptoms. Perhaps the medical practitioners who calculated this suspiciously accurate number should also attempt to cure haemorrhoids, as they\u0026rsquore clearly good at pulling things out their a***.  Yet, I\u0026rsquom sold. I\u0026rsquom already online ordering all the coconuts a Tesco delivery guy can carry, confident I\u0026rsquoll forever be able to recall every tedious second of my unremarkable existence. This is because I\u0026rsquove been enchanted by a wee photo of healthierpatriot\u0026rsquos originator, a smiling middle-aged gent with a twinkle in his eye who goes by the solid, honest name of Martin Reilly.  He looks reassuringly trustworthy and professional, the kind of guy you wouldn\u0026rsquot mind telling you to get your affairs in order when the MRI results come through. He boasts that distinctly American jutting masculine jawline, which is perhaps a flattering optical illusion gifted by his strong, dominant nose and thick shock of white hair, artfully swept into a self-consciously unkempt side-shed. In essence, he\u0026rsquos Dick Van Dyke in Diagnosis: Murder.  Further study reveals Reilly\u0026rsquos belief that coconut oil has cost \u0026ldquoBig Pharma \u0026ndash that familiar warcry of every subconscious Scientologist \u0026ndash \u0026ldquotens of thousands of dollars to date, adding the substance has also \u0026ldquoexposed the fact that they have no intention of curing anyone of these devastating brain diseases. Apparently this \u0026ldquobrain food has been shown to reverse memory loss and cure Alzheimer\u0026rsquos in just 30 days, leaving \u0026ldquothe medical community stunned. And, presumably, the \u0026ldquocured praying for death\u0026rsquos sweet embrace to free them from the hell of having a sparkling mind imprisoned inside a dried-up septuagenarian sandbag body.  Yet, despite Reilly suggesting the existence of \u0026ldquostunned doctors, no names are cited and no-one is quoted. He\u0026rsquos not wearing a white coat either in his wee pic, and if we\u0026rsquove learned anything from toothpaste adverts, it\u0026rsquos that folk who hawk health products are legally obliged to don white coats \u0026ndash even if their qualifications come from a drama school rather than a medical one. On his healthierpatriot pop-up, Reilly confidently sports a suave V-neck sweater, the kind of thing David Bowie would have worn to the cricket.  How are we to believe him then? Should we simply be sold by his fatherly, dominant alpha demeanour alone? How can we be sure he even exists and isn\u0026rsquot just a stock image of a well-preserved, white American male?  Well, we google his name of course. And it seems Reilly is indeed a real person, a \u0026ldquoscience coach and writer of various unprovable and unverified theories concerning health and wellbeing. His \u0026ldquoMemory Repair Protocol programme claims to help individuals prevent dementia by using \u0026ldquonatural constituents such as coconut and cocoa. So if you eat enough Bountys it may be possible to recall the bliss of your mother\u0026rsquos womb. A superior advertising tagline to \u0026ldquothe taste of paradise I\u0026rsquom sure you\u0026rsquoll agree.  Reilly then attempts to win our sympathies, stating that he created the \u0026ldquoMemory Repair Protocol programme to treat his own wife\u0026rsquos Alzheimer\u0026rsquos, experimenting with various spices, vegetables, herbs and oily components that seemingly grease the wheels of biological impossibility.  Just when my critical faculties were eventually beginning to kick in, guiding the mouse arrow towards an incredibly small \u0026ldquox in the pop-up\u0026rsquos right hand corner, I found myself again drawn to Martin\u0026rsquos face, his twinky electric blue eyes shooting lasers that were kryptonite to cynicism.  In a desperate attempt to deflect his tractor-beam charisma, what remained of my clinical, objective mind somehow managed to drudge up some half-remembered trivia from the deepest bowels of my memory \u0026ndash a commonly known \u0026ldquofact that coconut oil zealots often employ. The proof of this oil\u0026rsquos powers, they assert, is illustrated by dementia-free indigenous populations in parts of the Philippines, India and Sri Lanka, where diets boast copious amounts of fresh coconut.  Yet, when applying cold logic to this initially intriguing happenstance, their healthy brains make perfect sense \u0026ndash undoubtedly the result of balanced diets that include copious amounts of fish, fruits, and vegetables, all completely free from any questionable chemicals or preservatives. Perhaps it\u0026rsquos no coincidence so many of us fall victim to dementia in the land of the pizza crunchie. On a roll, of course. Unlike Martin Reilly.  POISONOUS OR NOT, IT\u0026rsquoS ALL ACADEMIC  SOME advice: if you\u0026rsquore ever blissfully surfing the interwebs with your kecks down and find your activities interrupted by Martin Reilly\u0026rsquos Rasputiny eyes in an pro-coconut oil pop-up, strengthen your resolve by repeating the words of his nemesis \u0026ndash Harvard scientist Karin Michels \u0026ndash as a protective mantra: \u0026ldquoPure poison, pure poison, pure poison. Just note you may never see your kids again if your partner walks in.  This week, Michels enraged millions of pseudo-nutritionists and fad sheep around the world by emphatically stressing that coconut oil was, indeed, \u0026ldquopure poison and also \u0026ldquoone of the worst foods you can eat. Perhaps she has not yet crossed paths with the humble pizza crunchie. Or experienced this uniquely Scottish delicacy with the obligatory roll and skoosh of tomato sauce on the bottom and curry sauce on top. Wha\u0026rsquos like us?  Michel\u0026rsquos harsh words weren\u0026rsquot just attention-seeking bluster, however \u0026ndash they were fired off with the righteous intent of shaming countless con-artists who profiteer from hope and desperation. It\u0026rsquos a shame she didn\u0026rsquot sign off by clarifying that the dead don\u0026rsquot talk either. Yet, in reaffirming that all scientific evidence for coconut oil\u0026rsquos wondrous properties points to either placebo, divine providence or, simply, people talking p**h, Michels likely now regrets reawakening the somewhat ridiculous debate on the substance\u0026rsquos alleged benefits. Yet, like most myths, we must acknowledge that rumours of its magical properties were indeed borne from a small seed of truth.  Most of us consume oil, be it vegetable, sunflower, olive or, if your doctor legally prescribes it of course, cannabis. One special component of coconut oil is caprylic acid \u0026ndash which the body breaks down into \u0026ldquoketone bodies for cells to feed upon. Similar to Lucozade, compliments and MDMA, our brains really like these ketone bodies, and draw a considerable amount of energy from them.  Brain scans of people suffering from dementia show, logically, that affected areas use less energy. Coconut worshippers often work under the pseudo-scientific presumption that ketone bodies can give the brain the extra energy it needs to function \u0026ldquoproperly. However, the vast majority of neuroscientists, including Michels, dismiss this argument \u0026ndash countering simply that dementia-effected cells are either dead or dying. Unless you\u0026rsquore Kriss Akabusi, whom scientists believe has the highest-ever recorded levels of energy in a human and will never suffer from dementia or even die.  For the rest of us, ingestion of coconut oil has not once been scientifically observed to help diabetes, cancer, heart disease, chronic fatigue, Crohn\u0026rsquos disease, IBS, cancer, thyroid issues or any other condition which a new breed of snake oil salesmen claim are \u0026ldquocurable.  Selling a health product that has no positive effect is bad enough, but is coconut oil actually \u0026ldquopoison? Well, it\u0026rsquos certainly no worse then sugar or ciggies.  Michels\u0026rsquo main concern is the product\u0026rsquos gargantuan dollop of saturated fat, which in excess amounts has been linked to obesity and other serious health conditions. Yet, recent research has highlighted other factors such as genetics, lifestyle and smoking as more likely to increase cardiac risk than sat fat. Still, if you enjoy a fag as you wait for your chips to fry in coconut oil, perhaps it\u0026rsquos best to get your affairs in order now before an MRI scan confirms what you already know."},{"url":null,"title":"brewdog told to pay sacked worker 12k","story":"        A former employee of Ellon-based brewers, BrewDog, has won his employment tribunal case after being sacked because he was losing his eyesight!                The company, renowned for brewing oddly-named beers, are based just outside the town in a purpose-built brewery which also serves at its headquarters.

The company’s response was to suspend him from his post in order to explore options, but then later sacked him, despite them having been advised by medical experts on the condition, that with some suitable adjustments to his working conditions, he could continue to be a valuable employee.        The employment tribunal which heard the case has now issued its ruling that BrewDog unlawfully discriminated against Mr Ross and treated him unfavourably because of his condition.The company, which has been valued at £1.8bn were told to pay compensation to Mr Ross in the sum of £12,052.New legislation which passed into law in 2015 prevented the tribunal from ordering that BrewDog staff undergo further equality training.A spokesman for the company said: “This was a really difficult situation for every member of our team involved in it, and clearly for the Tribunal panel too as their decision on the outcome was split.                                                                                                         “We worked with James in order to find a suitable alternative role within the business where his safety would not be compromised, but James wanted to keep his packaging role. “We ended up in a position where we had to balance James’ wishes with the best interests of the team around him, and while we regret that an agreement couldn’t be reached, we have a moral responsibility to prioritise the safety of our team. “We wish James all the best in his new role and his upcoming studies.”RNIB Scotland, which supports blind and partially sighted people, said: “Many employers still assume this group would be difficult or even impossible to employ.                                                                                                        “We know of journalists, teachers, bankers and physicists working in Scotland with sight loss.“It’s about encouraging employers to consider what people can do, not what they can’t.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"housing development for inverurie site","story":"        A new  housing development may be about to get underway in Inverurie following a recommendation to grant planning approval for a new development by CALA Homes.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Sunday 26 Aug 2018 7:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau (CAB), stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Sunday 26 Aug 2018 7:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Jobs boost for AMTE Power in Thurso","story":"THE number of staff at a Thurso business is to increase by 25 per cent over the next year following a partnership deal with a British technology company.The workforce at AMTE Power Ltd, based at Thurso Business Park, is expected to rise from 32 to 40 following the deal with QinetiQ whose headquarters are in Farnborough in Hampshire.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald (vice-chairman), Catherine Patterson (secretary) and Garance Warburton (treasurer).Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Sunday 26 Aug 2018 7:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people. These include social work, police, education, the Scottish Children\u0026rsquos Reporter Administration and Children\u0026rsquos Hearings Scotland.No new panel member begins sitting on hearings without a thorough training being delivered beforehand. For any new Caithness trainees, the training takes place in Inverness.Panel member and trainer Christine Stone said: \u0026ldquoIt has been a great privilege to serve as a volunteer on the Children\u0026rsquos Panel for over 18 years and there are others residing within Caithness who have served for more than 20 years. Caithness Children\u0026rsquos Panel volunteers come from a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences \u0026ndash all walks of life make for a good blend.\u0026ldquoThe panel is always in need of new volunteers and, to that end, we are inviting any interested persons to our open evening, to take place at 7pm at the Children\u0026rsquos Panel Office, 23 Swanson Street, Thurso, on Tuesday, August 28. Please do consider coming along!\u0026ldquoThis is an information evening, where an overview of the voluntary work will be given, which will be followed by a question-and-answer session.\u0026ldquoThis is a great opportunity to find out more and to see if this is for you. Being a panel member is hugely rewarding \u0026ndash it is a great privilege to be able to come alongside families, young people and children in crisis and help them move forward constructively to a better future.\u0026ldquoIf you are interested in applying to become a panel member, please feel free to contact me for any further information. Also, you can check out the Children\u0026rsquos Panel website where you will find more information which should help you decide if volunteering for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel is really for you.Sunday 26 Aug 2018 7:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August 25, 2018 at 5:48 pmRoad closures are in place on the B9057 at Sandwick Hall crossroads whilst police deal with a road traffic collision which occurred earlier today.

No personal information will be gathered as part of this.Evidence suggests that across Scotland more than a quarter of people in education have struggled at some point in the previous year to access sanitary products with some girls and young women having missed school or skipped classes because they didn’t have access to products.The Scottish Government, local authorities and the university and college sectors have therefore committed to providing free access to sanitary products in all schools, colleges and universities in Scotland beginning from the new academic term.Further information can be found at  www.young.scot/periods.\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Accompanied by a support boat, Mr Cameron, 40, reached the shore on the other side, near Duncansby Head, sometime just before 8.20pm tonight.Mr Cameron decided to take on the seven-mile swim across the Firth in memory of his girlfriend Ena Brown, who died suddenly earlier this year. Money raised through the challenge will be going to the Kirkwall Maternity Ward, where Ena had worked.Speaking tonight, Monday, following the swim, he said: \u0026#8220It was a grind, I was swimming for over four hours and I never stopped for one second, I just ploughed on the whole way.\u0026#8220It was quite choppy to start with but it got better as I went on. Things eased off after about an hour or so. I knew I had it in me, I was just worried about the conditions changing and having to pull the plug, so I couldn\u0026#8217t relax during the swim. I went through all sorts of emotions \u0026#8211 I was confident and I had moments of doubt.\u0026#8220That last hour was a real grind, I must confess. I could see Duncansby Head in the foreground and I didn\u0026#8217t think I had long to go, but I was scared to ask. I had thought I had about 15 minutes to go, but I had an hour-and-a-half to go. It was real tough going.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220I\u0026#8217ve done marathons, I\u0026#8217ve won Scottish championship surfing titles, but that\u0026#8217s the toughest thing I\u0026#8217ve done.Asked how he felt following the swim, he replied: \u0026#8220I feel a big weight off my shoulders. If this hadn\u0026#8217t happened this week we would have been looking at next summer. I feel I\u0026#8217ve achieved something, I know this has been done before once or twice before, but this is something I will remember for the rest of my life. It\u0026#8217s very rewarding.

Indeed, the evidence suggests that the capital grants previously available have made a real and positive impact.“Everyone agrees that encouraging new blood into farming is vitally important, including here in Orkney. At a time of real uncertainty for the sector, there is a need for the government to help provide what stability it can.“It is all the more surprising therefore that the minister has chosen to take this decision now.  I have written to Mr Ewing, who is due to visit Orkney next month, asking for a reassurance that the government does not intend to walk away from supporting new entrants and ensuring agriculture in Scotland has a bright future.”   \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Made with footage culled from up to 240 cameras that captured both the initial launch and the nine-day mission that followed, the film is a vital scientific document, a portrait of late \u0026#821760s America and a visually cogent exploration of man\u0026#8217s place in the universe.With an original score by Charles Morrow and a commanding narration by Laurence Luckinbill, the documentary won a special award at the Cannes Film Festival. However, for the next few decades, it was practically forgotten even the original printing elements were lost.Christopher Riley is a film producer, director and writer specialising in science, engineering and history. His work has been celebrated by BAFTA, the US Television Academy, the Royal Television Society, the Sundance Institute and the Grierson Trust.He is a regular contributor to  newspaper and presents science documentaries for BBC Radio 4. In 2007 he tracked down Theo Kamecke — who was working as a sculptor in upstate New York — and found that he held the only remaining 35mm print. Working closely with Theo, Moonwalk One was re-mastered, combining a unique 35mm director’s cut with newly transferred 16mm NASA flight film media, to create a new HD digital master of the film.This will be the first chance to see the new high-definition Blu-ray version of the film which is due to be released next year.Moonwalk One: The Director\u0026#8217s Cut is on at West Side Cinema, Stromness Town Hall, Saturday, September 8 at 7.45pm.

For an entry form, please go to www.rewdt.org. Alternatively, entry forms can be picked up in Trek and Travel and Cycle Orkney in Kirkwall, or entrants can also come along on the day and register before the race.This year’s lap will once again start at the pier and the race will be anti-clockwise around the island, finishing by Trumland House.Another run and walk is set to be held in Westray, with the biannual Bisgeos 12-mile run/walk.The 12-mile run/walk starts from Rapness Terminal at 10am, while a one-mile run and walk will take place from Quoys, Westside from 11am. A three-mile event will set off from Roadsmire, Westside at 11.30am. Registration closes 15 minutes prior to start times.Orkney Rowing Club will also be holding a yoal regatta on SaturdaySix races are set to be held, with boats in the water by 11.30am at the Burray Slip.

All races are to be held over a distance of approximately 1km.In football, a defining fixture at the top of the Orkney Cheese \u0026#8216A\u0026#8217 League will take place on Saturday night.Second hosts first, as Stromness welcome Thorfinn to the Market Green for the 6.30pm kick-off.A draw or win for Thorfinn would secure the title for the greens, while Stromness have to win to keep their hopes alive.On Sunday, Firth host Sandwick at 3pm and Stenness welcome Stromness Burgh to Harray at 6pm, in the semi-finals of the Thornley Binders Cup.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It consists of a retail box of fresh fish, sent directly to consumers all over the UK within hours of being landed. Fishbox now boasts in excess of 2000 subscribers with 100 new customers signing up every month.Mr Houston told the North Star: \"These are very exciting times for us. We will leave the Inverness premises on August 24. We have simply outgrown the premises and all of Coast \u0026amp Glen will relocate to Alness.\u0026nbsp We currently have 14 staff, plus four staff we have taken on from Summer Isles and are recruiting a further eight staff.

He went on to buy a small 21ft fishing boat, teaching himself from YouTube and Google. He decided to start selling his own catch and found the demand was so high he started selling from other boats. With the high demand from restaurants for a wider variety of products, Coast \u0026amp Glen was born.He said: \"I have always thought it\u0026rsquos very important to support the local community with jobs. It would be much easier for us to send fish to Glasgow to get processed just like majority of the salmon companies do and the whisky companies do for the bottling of their whisky, but that would have an impact on the area I was born and brought up in.\"This was the reason that I put a lot of time pressure on the people involved in the transition of the purchase of Summer Isles Foods.\"Sunday 26 Aug 2018 7:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Good Energy, based in Wiltshire, has more than 250,000 customers across the UK, adding to the 2 million-plus customers already served by SMS.             Under the terms of the agreement, SMS will supply domestic smart meters as part of the UK government’s rollout programme, which requires that domestic energy supply companies provide their customers with a smart meter to use in their homes and small businesses by 2020.SMS will provide new “SMETS 2” smart meters to monitor energy usage, which have a user-friendly advantage over the previous SMETS 1 model, as they allow customers to switch suppliers without changing meters. The majority of smart meters soon to be installed under the main phase of the government’s rollout scheme will be SMETS 2.  Alan Foy, chief executive officer at SMS, which is quoted on the alternative investment market (AIM), said: “We are delighted to be working with Good Energy as their exclusive supplier, one of the UK’s leading suppliers of energy from renewable sources, in the rollout of their smart meter programme. “Good Energy have over 250,000 customers across the UK, SMS is well positioned to support them with the smart meter rollout given our strong track record for customer services and asset ownership and management.”            John Maltby, Good Energy chairman, said the partnership would lead to a good user experience for the supplier’s customers.

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

But fate is a fickle mistress and so late on Thursday it emerged her friend and mentor, Alex Salmond, was at the centre of two allegations of sexual harassment/assault examined by civil servants operating under the new rules on complaints against ex-ministers. These allegations had been passed on to the police.            The following morning, Sturgeon faced the unenviable prospect of publicly responding to a situation which has the potential to rip the SNP apart. The pressure must have been immense. Sturgeon’s friendship with Salmond is close and long-standing they stood side by side throughout the referendum campaign, although the relationship appears to have frayed over the past year.             With a survey suggesting one in five people in Holyrood have experienced sexual harassment or sexist behaviour, however, it was crucial the First Minister put the rights of the women to have their complaints rigorously investigated above personal loyalty. As someone who has trumpeted her support for gender equality in the workplace near the top of her agenda, anything short of an explicit endorsement of permanent secretary Leslie Evans’ actions would have been judged as hypocrisy.In the event, Sturgeon, though clearly perturbed, rose to the occasion. “I have been clear... that all organisations and workplaces must make it possible for people to come forward to report concerns and have confidence that they will be treated seriously,” she said. “For that principle to mean anything it cannot be applied selectively. It must be applied without fear or favour, regardless of the identity, seniority or political allegiance of the person involved.”Her determination not to waver in the face of Salmond’s anger and the spectre of a court case was significant for several reasons. Earlier in the week, the revelation that actor Asia Argento, one of the first women to accuse Harvey Weinstein of assault, was alleged to have slept with an underage boy, prompted a mini backlash against #MeToo. With some critics exploiting Argento’s behaviour to undermine the campaign, it was good to hear a political leader reassert the importance of creating a culture of accountability. The application of the updated procedure, with the claims investigated by the civil service and not the party, and Sturgeon keeping herself at a distance, also marked a step change from the chaos that characterised the investigation into former childcare and early years minister, Mark McDonald, less than a year ago. The circus that surrounded his return to Holyrood as an independent, during which women at the centre of the investigation were effectively erased, created a climate unconducive to future reporting the way these allegations have been handled may start to repair the damage.            Not that everyone was so keen on the new approach. Salmond, who vociferously denies the allegations, initially tried to gag Evans as she prepared to make them public. He dropped those proceedings, but is now seeking a judicial review over the handling of the complaints. He argues the procedures should not have been applied retrospectively (he had been out of office for three years by the time they were made) and that the investigation itself was carried out unfairly.Salmond is, of course, as entitled as everyone else to the presumption of innocence, but his attempts to put obstacles in the way of due process is not a good look for any politician who wants to be seen as an ally to women. Nor is the frankly bizarre suggestion that resolving the matter by conciliation, mediation or legal arbitration would have been in “everybody’s best interests, particularly those of the two complainants”. Does Salmond really believe these women are incapable of judging such matters for themselves?Outside Holyrood, there were fringe elements on both sides of the divide whose respect for due process was lacking. Some Unionists revisited the old Solero ice lolly photograph and hinted that he always seemed the type. Some Yessers insisted the allegations were part of a vast conspiracy cooked up to discredit the party and the independence movement.Particularly worrying was the denunciation of the complainers as false accusers, with some on Facebook going so far as to suggest, again without producing any evidence, that one of them had been involved in the setting up of the new procedures.            Such behaviour lends weight to the belief, prominent among feminists, that parts of the Yes movement are infected with a misogyny that is swept under the carpet in the pursuit of independence. We recently witnessed the invective unleashed on SNP councillor Rhiannon Spear after she asked why all three speakers at a “BBC bias” protest were men. Imagine what the women at the centre of this investigation would have to endure if their identities came into the public domain. This is especially pertinent when you consider some of the unedifying coverage yesterday. Phrases such as “sex pest” and “boozy bedroom encounter” trivialised the claims while the focus on what all this meant for Salmond was retrogressive.What Sturgeon has done is to distance herself and the SNP from the impulse to put party unity and independence above all else, and to stress the gravity of the situation. This is not to say she doesn’t have questions to answer. The most obvious is the one Scottish Labour has been asking: why hasn’t Salmond been suspended from the SNP just as McDonald was after his accusers came forward? In an interview with the BBC, Sturgeon implied it was because this investigation was not carried out by the party and so the party was not yet privy to its findings. But if there is enough substance to merit a report to the police, then it’s difficult to see why Salmond’s treatment should differ substantially from McDonald’s.More questions will follow if the judicial review finds the investigation was improperly conducted, although it is difficult to see how this would impact on the criminal inquiry which has already been set in motion and will surely now run its course.Life will get even tougher if it turns out the First Minister was aware of any other claims of inappropriate behaviour involving Salmond before he informed her of these ones. But, as playwright and director David Greig said, how we respond to this situation will define our political culture for the future whether or not there is independence.             “No more throwing women under the bus for Indy, for socialism, for art or any other supposed higher goal,” he tweeted.Sturgeon has set the right tone. For the moment, at least, she is leading by example."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4789811.1535224996!/image/image.jpg","title":"euan mccolm call out the nats for brexit double standard","story":"        Consumed by the certainty of the zealot, former first minister Alex Salmond spent much of the 2014 independence referendum campaign loudly denouncing anyone who dared suggest that breaking up the United Kingdom might come at a cost to Scotland as a scaremonger.                The very idea that a Yes vote would be anything but the key to unlock the gate preventing access to a land of milk and honey was all part of Project Fear in fact, went the Salmond spiel, a No vote would be catastrophic. Only independence could save the country.            In the end, a majority of Scots refused to be “charmed” by Salmond, who became increasingly ratty as polling day approached and has spent much of the past four years refighting old battles with those – Treasury officials, the BBC, anyone who ever looked at him funny – he blames for his failure to lead Yes to victory.            The truth is that Salmond lost, fair and square. His campaign was full of enticing promises but bereft of detail. The former first minister failed to persuade Scots that leaping into the dark with him was worth the risk because he couldn’t provide plausible answers to the most basic questions on currency and the economy.The Salmond mantra – proudly repeated by his successor, Nicola Sturgeon, and other senior SNP figures – was that the best people to make decisions affecting Scotland were people living in Scotland. Only by unlocking this power, could the country truly thrive.Two years after Salmond failed to persuade Scots to take back control, Ukip’s Nigel Farage used an almost identical approach to help win victory for the Leave campaign in the EU referendum. At times, a note-for-note cover version of Salmond’s indy song, Farage’s argument – that the best people to make decisions affecting the UK were people living in the UK – was a success.So why do we continue to put up with the myth that supporters of Scottish independence and supporters of leaving the EU are fundamentally different?Scottish Brexit Minister Mike Russell last week warned that Scotland faced a “nightmare” if the UK government failed to strike a deal with the EU the damage to business, services and the economy would be disastrous.            And it’s entirely likely – since 62 per cent of Scots wished the UK to remain in the EU – that he will have enjoyed the support of many of those listening.In the absence of anything vaguely resembling opposition from the Labour Party, the SNP has filled the void where an anti-Brexit party should be.But that doesn’t make the nationalists’ case any more coherent.If it is reckless to break up a partnership with the EU, with all of the implications that move has for trade and the economy, why is it not reckless to break up a partnership with England, with which Scotland does most of its business?            And how on earth can anyone take seriously the SNP’s claim that only independence can “save” Scotland from the pain of Brexit?The former SNP MP, Jim Sillars, is that rarest of beasts – a pro-independence Eurosceptic. His position involves the unfashionable application of logic: if Scotland should be a “sovereign nation” then breaking all unions – not just the one with the English (or the Westminsters as we are now obliged to call them) – is necessary.Sillars’ position makes sense. It may not be appealing to those who believe in partnerships but it is intellectually coherent.This is much more than can be said for the position advanced by Sturgeon, Russell and others on the SNP front bench.As Brexit looms, the Scottish nationalists will ratchet up the message that a second independence referendum is necessary. They will insist that Scotland can escape the Brexit “nightmare” if only the people choose to break up the UK.            We should treat these claims with the utmost scepticism.How, exactly, would entering into another break-up ameliorate the damage caused by this one? Surely, the risk of a Yes vote any time soon is that a bad situation is made worse.Even Russell, not a man in possession of one of the finer minds in contemporary politics, must surely know that arguing what Scotland needs now is to be even further isolated is nonsense.Identity politics – so terribly popular right now – allows for people to hold entirely contradictory views at the same time. A Scottish nationalist, certain that theirs is the politics of hope, of unlocking potential, can quite happily believe that it is essential to have a formal union with countries on mainland Europe while it’s equally essential that links with England are broken. Surely the time to stop indulging this sort of nonsense has long passed?By all means, be pro-independence, but don’t try to kid yourself letting power reside in Brussels is somehow different to letting it reside in Westminster.The Leave campaign got away with quite a lot in 2016. They lied and bluffed and cheated their way to victory. In 2014, the Yes campaign – just as full of nonsensical claims, hyperbolic warnings and promises to take back power from the establishment – wasn’t so lucky.It’s been two years since the EU referendum and the SNP has been allowed – thanks to Brexit chaos in both the Conservative and Labour Parties – to proclaim its contradictory positions on independence with few questions asked. But this particular emperor has no clothes. A politician arguing that the uncertainty created by leaving the EU is bad but that the uncertainty created by leaving the UK would represent an opportunity is guilty of placing ideology above reason.The UK’s departure from the EU is to be hugely regretted. It will, I fear, be proved an act of national self-harm.Responding to the instability created by Brexit by arguing for the break-up of the UK – with all of the uncertainties such a decision would create – simply doesn’t make sense and we should stop pretending that it does."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4789888.1535231211!/image/image.jpg","title":"fresh calls for sturgeon to suspend salmond over allegations","story":"        The SNP is under renewed pressure to suspend Alex Salmond from the party after details of the accusations against him were leaked to the media.                Salmond denies any wrongdoing. The former First Minister has been accused of inappropriate behaviour in December 2013 by two Scottish government employees.            READ MORE: Woman alleges Alex Salmond touched her breasts and bottomIn one of the allegations reported to the government, one woman is said to have repeatedly asked  Salmond to stop touching her in an encounter in the bedroom at the First Minister’s official Edinburgh residence, Bute House.            The woman has alleged multiple instances of unwanted sexual attention during Salmond’s time in office, according to the Daily Record, which claims to have seen wording from her complaint.She alleges that following an official engagement in December 2013 where the First Minister had been drinking alcohol, the pair found themselves alone.She claims Salmond instructed her to move from a public area to the bedroom, and repeatedly offered her alcohol, despite her refusals.He then told her to get on the bed before lying on top of her, kissing her and touching her breasts and bottom through her clothes, according to the report in the Daily Record.An investigation into the two allegations by the Scottish Government permanent secretary Leslie Evans has concluded, and details have been passed to Police Scotland.             Salmond is mounting a legal challenge against the government’s handling of the complaints, claiming its procedures are “unjust”.A fresh statement from Salmond issued yesterday said: “As Mr Salmond made very clear yesterday when he spoke to all media outlets, he intends to make no further comment on these matters until his petition for judicial review is heard in the Court of Session.“This is done on legal advice and in the context that he refutes these complaints of impropriety and absolutely denies any suggestion of criminality.”Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said Sturgeon should suspend Salmond from the SNP immediately.            “Not to do so will send the wrong message to members in her party and the people of Scotland,” she said.“People who experience harassment should be able to come forward in the knowledge there is a safe environment to do so and that the workplace they are in treats their complaint robustly.“The SNP must do all it can to give complainants the support they need whoever the alleged perpetrator is and make clear that there is safe space for any other survivors to come forward.“The First Minister has been too slow to act on these shocking allegations. “Nicola Sturgeon must take action and she must do it now.”            Scottish Conservative MSP Annie Wells said: “We must respect the women who complained and allow due and fair process to continue so that the facts can be brought out.“However, these revelations do raise questions about the way this matter was treated when it is alleged to have taken place, and these also need to be answered.She added: “We need to see full transparency from the SNP and the Scottish Government.”Leslie Evans, Permanent Secretary at the Scottish Government, said the two complaints were raised in January and Salmond was notified in March about an investigation. She intended to make a statement regarding the complaints this week but the move was halted after the former first minister initiated legal proceedings.Sturgeon said she first heard about the investigation from Salmond in April and had no role in the complaints process.A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “For legal reasons, the Scottish Government cannot comment on the nature of the complaints.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.

LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nSunday 26 Aug 2018 7:43 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117085.jpg","title":"Dalwhinnie makeover starts to take shape","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nDALWHINNIE is on the verge of a major makeover at its southern entrance.\nFor too long dogged by a disused, overgrown compound and a rusting old water treatment works, villagers are now beginning to hope that things could change dramatically over the next few months.\nAll being well, they heard on Tuesday, a \u0026pound2.3 million upgrade by Scottish Water could get under way in the new year which would leave the village with a new treatment works by this time next year.\n\"There\u0027s a long way to go,\" said the north\u0027s corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel when the Strathy met with an SW team in the village hall, \"but we\u0027re hopeful that all the many stages will be gone through on schedule.\n\"We are having to consult with a lot of different individuals and organisations \u0026ndash not least the national park authority, the Highland Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and landowners \u0026ndash but this is work which will have to be done on behalf of the community.\n\"Quite simply the current system has reached its sell-by date.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/HOUSING-KYLE-1.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary (better known as ‘Nana’) Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018.

The onset of the Tory Brexit, backed by the DUP, also represents an attack on the rights of people in the north. \nThe main speaker at the end of the commemoration at the Square in Dungannon will be former Sinn Féin MLA Mitchel McLaughlin. \nSpeaking ahead of Saturday\u0027s march, the former Northern Assembly Speaker called for a huge turnout. \"Let\u0027s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0027s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said. \nThe parade will begin in Coalisland at 3pm on Saturday and make its way to Dungannon. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

It is only the second visit by a Pope to Ireland and has generated huge interest, particularly in recent weeks and days. \n\"Hundreds of thousands of people from right across the island are expected to travel to Dublin and Knock for the Papal events and countless more will be watching the events in the media. \n\n\"While for many this will be an occasion of celebration, for a significant group in our society it will also be a very difficult and challenging time. \n\"Many Irish people have suffered and have been deeply hurt by the abuses of the church over many decades, particularly the victims and survivors of child sex abuse and those who suffered in industrial schools, mother and baby homes and the Magdalene laundries. \n\"Many of them will have a very different view of this visit and I am very conscious of their views and acknowledge how difficult it will be for them,\" he said. \nConor Murphy said the Papal visit provides an opportunity for the Catholic church authorities to address the issue of abuse. \n\"For decades the Catholic church sought to cover up the horrendous abuse and this only compounded the hurt and suffering of victims and survivors. \n\"Hopefully this visit will provide an opportunity for that deep hurt to be acknowledged by the church hierarchy. But more than that, it is an opportunity to do something about it and that opportunity should be grasped. \n\"While the letter from Pope Francis acknowledged that hurt and suffering, it needs to be followed with more than words action is required,\" he said. \nThe former minister said the Catholic church needs to cooperate with investigations into abuse and address the legacy of abuse by providing redress to victims. \n\"This issue is not going away. While I acknowledge that the Pope will meet a number of victims and survivors of clerical abuse and it is important that he hears and listens to their stories, more is needed. The Vatican must release any and all files it holds that would help investigations and inquiries into abuse by priests and religious in Ireland and it must also commit itself to providing redress, including financial redress to victims of abuse north and south,\" he said. \n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27464  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nThe first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades.\nToday, 24th August, marks the 50th anniversary of the first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon in County Tyrone. \nThe Brantry Republican Club, led by Annie Mary Gildernew, had campaigned against the lack of council housing in the area. \n spoke exclusively to Colm Gildernew, Sinn Féin MLA for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and grandson of Annie Mary or better known as ‘Nana’ Gildernew, about the first civil rights march and events leading to it.\n“Fifty years ago, on the 12th of October 1967, Dungannon District Council convened its monthly meeting.  \n“One of the decisions they were about to take would reverberate across decades and bring the northern Unionist state to its knees and, some argue, ultimately led to its demise as a one party Orange state.\n“The Brantry Sinn Fein Republican Club, under the leadership of Annie Mary Gildernew (my Grandmother) had been trying to secure housing in the local area for nationalist families. \n“Dungannon Council refused point blank to build social housing in the Brantry area as this would also provide local nationalists with votes as well as housing.  \nInstead they agreed to build 15 houses in the then predominantly unionist village of Caledon and stated they would allocate these homes on the basis of half to unionists and half to nationalist families to ease the housing crisis.\n“At the council meeting this deal was reneged upon Unionist Councillor William Scott simply presented a list of 15 names which he had decided would be housed, no debate, no discussion, no democracy.\n“The Brantry Republican Club met immediately to assess their next move.  It was decided that they were left with no alternative but to take immediate and direct action.  \n“At 2am, on Friday the 13th of October members of the Gildernew, Goodfellow and McKenna families supported by the Brantry Republican club went to Caledon and took possession of two of the newly allocated homes, (numbers 9 and 11 Kinnard Park, Caledon) including a three bedroom house which had been allocated to a single 19-year-old woman who worked for a Unionist election candidate.  \n“In May 1968, following a 6 month series of court action and coercion, the State’s patience gave way a force of policemen, led by the brother of the young single girl who had been allocated the house, evicted Nana Gildernew, her daughter Mary Theresa Goodfellow with a three-month old baby and two other small children, and her daughter in law Geraldine Gildernew, expecting me at the time and with two young children.  They were forcibly dragged from the house under the gaze of the world’s press. \n“This led to the organisation of the first Civil Rights March from Coalisland to Dungannon was 24th of August to protest the eviction. The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north. This could have a chilling impact on rights and representation in the six counties,\" he concluded.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8610896.1535013057!/image/image.jpg","title":"10 new jobs set to be created with the opening of intersport in antrim","story":"\nGlobal sports retailer, Intersport is set to open a new store at The Junction in Antrim, creating up to 10 new jobs. \n\n                \nIntersport has announced a significant £250,000 investment at the retail and leisure park, which will see the global brand open its doors in September, occupying a 5,600 sq ft unit next to Tom Tailor and O’Briens.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe new store is part of an ongoing £30 million redevelopment plan at the Antrim-based shopping centre and follows recent developments including the construction of a new McDonald’s restaurant and the arrival of the Beauty Outlet, the UK’s fastest growing beauty retailer. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIntersport is one of the world’s largest sports retailers and innovators in Sportswear, with over 5,500 stores, 220 of which are located in the UK. \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe brand prides itself on providing active wear for all ages and abilities, from beginners to athletes, and will house an array of popular sporting brands including Adidas, Under Armour, Puma, Canterbury, ProTouch and Speedo.\n\n Alastair Coulson, Managing Director for Lotus Property said: “The arrival of Intersport is a welcome addition to the centre and further complements our growing portfolio of retail and leisure brands.\n\n“Building on other recent developments, including the arrival of The Beauty Outlet and the commencement of building work for McDonald’s, this marks another important milestone in our £30m Master Plan for The Junction.” \n\nPadraic McKeever, Managing Director of Sports Merchandising Ireland, which holds the Intersport franchise, added: “This latest store opening at The Junction is an exciting moment for Intersport. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The Intersport mission is to inspire and connect with the everyday athlete through sport and we can’t wait to work with the team at The Junction to spread this message to the people of Antrim and beyond.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try { _402_Show() } catch(e) {}    \n"},{"url":null,"title":"a level success at slemish college","story":"\nSlemish College is celebrating A Level exams success with 97% of students achieving three A Levels, with 83% of grades were at C or above. \n\n                \nThere were some outstanding individual achievements and over a third of grades were A or A*.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe majority of A levels subjects achieved 100% A*-C including Art, Hospitality and Catering, Business Studies, Further Maths,  Computing, Chemistry, Biology, English Literature, Health and Social Care, Media Studies, Physics, Environmental Technology, Sport, and Construction.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nActing Principal Mr Michael Bennett said: “All our students should feel very proud of their endeavours and we particularly want to thank our A2 students for all that they have contributed to Slemish College. \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“We wish you well in future endeavours and know you will achieve amazing things.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie. A remote service after Friday\u0027s first two stages would work for everyone.

And it’s an ideal venue to host birthday parties and school or group outings.”\n\nAir-tastic currently has two trampoline parks, located in Bangor and Cork, with a number of other Air-tastic trampoline parks planned to open in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in due course. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor further information on Air-tastic and the Craigavon trampoline park opening visit www.air-tastic or search Air-tastic Craigavon on Facebook.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602227.1534344744!/image/image.jpg","title":"can you help a history project","story":"\nDid you ever work in the old Mayfair manufacturing company in Portadown? If so, then Mayfair Business Centre would like to hear from you.  \n\n                \nThe present day Mayfair Business Centre is inviting former workers who were employed at the sewing factory to discuss their memories and experiences of working there. This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols","story":"\nThe Education Authority (EA) has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland return to school in the coming days.\n\n                \nA spokesperson for the EA offered the assurance in response to media coverage revealing that the authority had considered removing “lollipop men and women” in a bid to save money.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA letter obtained by BBC News NI revealed that the EA faces an estimated funding gap of £58 million in 2018/19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt highlights a number of “difficult choices” the authority is faced with in order to cut costs, including the possible removal of school crossing patrols, withdrawing uniform allowances and making compulsory redundancies in schools.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAccording to the BBC, EA board members regarded the possibility of scrapping school crossing patrols – and other potentially controversial savings measures – as “unpalatable” and decided that any decision to make such cuts should be down to the Department of Education.\n\nThe letter also suggests that “traffic control measures” are not the EA’s responsibility, but that of the Department for Infrastructure and the

for school crossing patrols in the current financial year.”\n\nManned crossings are seen as a vital for the safety of children crossing busy roads, and the DUP’s education spokesman said any move to remove lollipop men and women would be “unacceptable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“While undoubtedly the Education Authority and the department have to explore every option to live within budget, this idea cannot be regarded as a serious suggestion and it is clear that the members of the Education Authority would reject any attempt to propose it,” said Peter Weir MLA.\n\n“The safety of our children must be paramount, and there is no need to remove the current process for assessing individual placements of lollipop people provision.”\n\nThe Strangford MLA continued: “This bizarre suggestion does however highlight two key issues. Firstly, the extent to which education is effectively subsidising other elements of government particularly on road safety and transport and there needs to be a debate about where financial responsibility is borne. \n\n“Secondly, it further shines a light on the heavy pressures facing education in Northern Ireland, and the need for strategic changes and reform which need commitment on an Executive-wide basis, which again highlights the damage being done by a single party putting their narrow interests ahead of proper decision making and the restoration of government.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602298.1534346604!/image/image.jpg","title":"fifty years on from first civil rights march","story":"\nOn August 24, 1968, Northern Ireland\u0026#8217s first civil rights march took place between Coalisland and Dungannon. \n\n                \nOn the march were teachers, students and politicians who all wanted the same thing, equality and civil rights.

This is the first time the event has been staged in Ireland.\nPope Francis will arrive in Dublin on Saturday, almost 40 years since Pope John Paul II came and addressed the faithful at capacity Masses in Drogheda, Knock and Phoenix Park. Pope Francis’ first engagement will be meeting President Michael D Higgins before visiting St Mary’s Pro-Cathedral and then the Capuchin Day Centre, which provides hot meals, clothing and showers for the city’s homeless. Pope Francis will then preside at the Festival of Families in Croke Park.\nHis visit will conclude on Sunday with a closing Mass at Phoenix Park. An estimated 500,000 people are expected to attend with thousands more watching the live footage from around the world.\nRector of Clonard Monastery Fr Noel Kehoe said that the parish is running a bus to the weekend events in Dublin “on Friday” and that he will be staying “to attend both the festival of Families and attend the Papal Mass”.\nParish Manager at St Oliver Plunkett Parish Glen Phillips told the Andersonstown News that Pope Francis’ visit had created “such a buzz within the parish”.\n“We have a coach leaving tomorrow (Thursday) so that parishioners can attend the WMOF Congress in the RDS.\n“A number of families from the parish will also be attending the Festival of Families in Croke Park on Saturday and we are also running a coach to the Papal Mass in Phoenix Park on Sunday.\n “There is such a buzz around the parish as the Papal visit approaches. Many older parishioners remember Pope John Paul II’s visit and many young parishioners were brought up on stories about it. Pope Francis is re-invigorating the Church and many parishioners want to be part of that and show support for him,” he said.\nSt John’s Church was proudly displaying its bunting and Papal flags as parishioners filed out from Mass on Wednesday morning. Parish Manager Conor Neeson explained how some of the decorations had stood the test of time and dated back to John Paul II’s visit.\n“We will have a number of buses on from Friday morning taking parishioners down to Dublin for the Pope’s visit. As part of the Falls Road Pastoral Community, parishioners from Corpus Christi, St John’s, St Mary’s, St Paul’s and St Peter’s Cathedral will all be travelling this weekend. There is a great sense of occasion and I’ll be staying behind to organise the parish hall for the Mass on Sunday as we will be screening it live,” he said.\nChair of the Pastoral Council Annette Hinchcliffe said she will be attending the Mass along with her teenage children and had also been part of history when she travelled down on the train to see John Paul II say Mass in 1979.\n“Many of our elderly population in the parish would have loved to have attended the Mass on Sunday but a lot of the instructions about once people get off their buses is the walk to Phoenix Park which is a possible three miles. We thought it would be nice to bring everyone together to give them a flavour of the day so that they wouldn’t just be watching it in the house. Our parishioners will have an opportunity to come to the parish centre to watch the Mass and be with the other people in their parish,” she said.\nParishioner Frances McEvoy told us: “I’m going down today (Wednesday) for the different discussions and events that are taking place over the next couple of days each day ending with a Mass and I’m looking forward to enjoying the weekend celebrations as well.\n“I was in Phoenix Park whenever John Paul II came and I think this Pope has the same charisma. I think he will be very welcomed despite all that is going on at the minute.\n“It’s very exciting. I was in Rome before Christmas staying with friends and I was at one of his meetings, when he meets the people on a Wednesday. The atmosphere when he walks in is just incredible. There is definitely  something about him. I think despite in terms of some of the negative publicly there has been around the visit he will speak to the people and he speaks from his heart,” she said.\nAt an extremely busy The Holy Shop in city centre’s Chapel Lane sales assistants Maura McShane and Teresa Nolan told us how there had been “great interest” in their Pope Francis memorabilia ahead of the highly anticipated visit.\n“We have rosary beads, candles, framed photos of Pope Francis and prayer cards all to mark his visit for the World Meeting of Families,” explained Teresa. “He is a very popular Pope and the amount of our customers going this weekend to see him is unreal,” she said.\nMaura said that many people were calling in since staff created their window display and there was a real “excitement” with people ahead of the weekend.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"all the traffic and travel details ahead of the popes visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They had everything they wanted.\" \n\nMr Currie was brought up in Coalisland, an overwhelmingly nationalist town. \n\nHe was elected as a Nationalist MP for East Tyrone from 1964 until 1972, and was one of the founders of the SDLP.\n\nHe moved to the Republic in 1989 and was Fine Gael TD for Dublin West.\n\nIn June 1968 Mr Currie and others occupied a house in Caledon, Co Tyrone, in protest at the discriminatory allocation of houses by the local council. \n\nWhen he saw a 19-year-old girl \"who happened to be a Protestant and a unionist\" and \"worked at a unionist politician\u0027s solicitor\u0027s office\" being allocated a home ahead of 269 others on the waiting list, he said he felt compelled to take action. \n\n\"I just felt it was unfair, unjust, intolerable and something had to be done, and I did it,\" he said. \n\nMr Currie said he made the decision to organise the march after taking part in the protests against the housing situation, hoping the event would be similar to those witnessed in the southern states of the United States. Two months after that march, another civil rights protest ended in violent scenes when police clashed with protesters in Londonderry. \n\nMr Currie said organisers had actually been disappointed with the numbers that turned out for the march, which had been banned, yet he said it has since become one of the catalysts for the entire civil rights movement here. \n\n\"The RUC acted absolutely stupidly and in front of the television cameras, particularly RTE, they ran awry, they ran mad and it was on the television and was seen around the world and that really effectively gave the boost which became the very successful civil rights movement,\" he said. \n\nThe former TD said he regretted the loss of lives during the Troubles that ensued afterwards. \n\n\"It wasn\u0027t inevitable that it would happen,\" he said, insisting non-violence was at the heart of the civil rights movement. It was very unfortunate and was not inevitable. But I wish it hadn\u0027t happened.\"\n\nMr Currie added: \"The civil rights campaign was an extremely successful organisation and it actually changed the whole political scene as far as Northern Ireland was concerned, and of course I don\u0027t regret that.\" \n\nHe criticised the current power-sharing impasse at Stormont. He said it was a \"totally hypocritical situation\" that elected representatives were being paid when the Assembly was not sitting. \n\nVeteran DUP man Nelson McCausland has a very different interpretation of the civil rights movement. \n\nThe former Stormont minister said: \"It may be the anniversary of the first civil rights march but he said it was certainly not their first appearance on the streets in that they had been out in Easter in 1968 against the banning of the republican Easter Rising parade. \n\n\"That in a sense was part of the problem, that right from the start the civil rights movement was so closely aligned with Irish nationalism and republicanism.\" \n\nHe said the movement was \"never going to be a place that was welcoming to unionists\".\n\nHe added: \"The tragedy is that it led on eventually to a situation which broke out into violence that led to more than 3,000 people dead.\" \n\nThe former MLA claimed that there are a lot of inaccuracies when it came to the housing statistics from the time.\n\n\"Much of what was put forward as fact to justify claims of discrimination was actually manipulated,\" he claimed. \n\nHe said there were some examples where there was an \"unbalance\" but he maintained that overall there was a \"fairly reasonable\" spread of council housing going to Catholic and Protestants at the time. \n\n\"It\u0027s not the picture that was portrayed at the time,\" he said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"eleanors the one for gareth after he pops the question at kodaline gig","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It turns out he\u0027d gone to Custom House Square to make sure everything was going to go as he planned.\"\n\nIt\u0027s been two years, three months and four days since the couple first met at the Balmoral Show in May 2016, and they clicked shortly afterwards when they were paired up with a restaurant voucher during a charity \u0027Take Me Out\u0027 night in Strabane.\n\n\"He\u0027s never been the sort of person to do stunts like this,\" said Eleanor. \"He works on the family dairy farm with his brothers so it was very unexpected.\n\n\"It took a lot of convincing for me to get to the concert, but my best friend Rachel Nelson from Ballyclare was in on this from the start and persuaded me I had to go with her. She was the only other person he\u0027d told.\n\n\"Gareth was frantically texting at the start of the concert. I wondered who he was sending messages to but Rachel told me not to be so nosy.\n\n\"Then they told me I\u0027d won a competition to go back stage so I was lined up there with Gareth at the side of the stage as the band started to play \u0027The One\u0027.\n\n\"It turns out he\u0027d gone to buy the engagement ring that morning and had everything planned.

We would remind all our customers that opening a manhole and putting anything down it is forbidden. By doing this, you are obstructing a working sewer which is designed to take waste away from homes. Incidents like this cause out of sewer flooding and require valuable time and resources to resolve,\" she said.\n\nShe urged people to dispose of their fat, oil and grease properly. \n\n“While most homes and businesses use grease traps and bin their waste correctly, those that don’t, contributed to a massive fatberg in the sewers around the area,\" Mrs McCullagh said\n\n“We would appeal to all our customers, especially food outlets, to dispose of their fat, oil and grease appropriately. For householders, let it cool and then put it into the bin. Alternatively, pour it into a disposable container and take it to your local oil bank.\n\n“Businesses also risk blocking their own drainage systems, which results in extra costs being incurred in clean-up efforts. These fat blockages can not only result in out of sewer flooding, but odour problems and the risk of rat infestations both near and beyond your premises. Ways to dispose of FOG include fitting a grease trap, using an enzyme dosing system or recycling it.\"\n\nMrs McCullagh said the fatberg was having a negative affect on the whole community.\n\n“We have all seen the disgusting effects of an overflowing manhole in the street and no one wants to see or smell it (not even us!) but the reality is, it happens regularly at a cost of millions to NI Water each year,\" he said.\n\n“We all have the power to stop it. In the last ten years, NI Water has spent over £1.5 billion investing in water and wastewater infrastructure but no amount of investment will completely stop blocked pipes if people continue to flush wipes (including flushable), sanitary items and cotton buds down the toilet.”\n\nShe urged people to properly dispose of sanitary products.\n\n“According to recent research carried out by Water UK, 93% of the material causing sewer blockages was made up of wipes - including a high proportion of baby wipes - which are not designed to be flushed. Less than 1% of the domestic waste in the blockages was identified as made up of products which are designed to be flushed, such as toilet paper.\n\n“Customer awareness and behaviour change is the only real way to address sewer misuse it’s simple really, don’t flush anything other than paper, poo and pee.\n\n“Visit \nwww.niwater\n for further information.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new mural celebrating 100 years of raf unveiled","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It really is the missing piece in our Poppy Trail, as we already have Army and Navy-related artworks along the Road, remembering the hundreds of men from South Belfast who fought in World War One.”\n\nRAF historian Pete Bleakley has a personal, as well as professional stake in the Northern Ireland RAF100 Mural, as his paternal grandfather Robert joined the fledging RAF in 1918 and flew in the latter stages of the war.\n\n“My main area of expertise is World War Two RAF, but I’ve been enjoying the research for this World War One project, as it has given me an insight into what my grandfather went through, at a time when aviation - which was still really in its infancy - was greatly accelerated by the demands of air reconnaissance and combat over France,” he said.\n\nThe mural project, which has been over two years in development and has included an educational visit for local primary school children to RAF Aldergrove, has been managed throughout by Belfast-based Wing Commander Tara Scott. \n\n“From the Royal Air Force perspective, we wanted to have a lasting monument which reflected our one hundred years presence in Northern Ireland, and we feel the South Belfast mural is both informative and commemorative, and it is a good fit with the existing Poppy Trail murals, which recall the service and sacrifice of local people during the First World War,” Mrs Scott said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland man has whata boutye eyelid tatoo removed year on from benidorm stag","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Dr Donal McKeown, a laser specialist, read Steven\u0027s story online, and offered his expertise in tattoo removal.\n\nA year on, the results have been well worth the wait.\n\n\"In all my 25 years of removing tattoos, I\u0027ve seen them on every other part of the body but never on the upper eyelids,\" said Dr McKeown, who is based on Belfast\u0027s Antrim Road. \n\n\"I\u0027ve even removed them from the inside of the mouth, but Steven\u0027s case was unique, and quite difficult. I had to proceed very cautiously, with the laser down at low levels.\"\n\nSteven, from Tullycarnet, was in Spain as part of a 15-strong group celebrating his cousin James\u0027s upcoming marriage, when he drunkenly decided to get the €22 (£20) \u0027whata boutye\u0027 tattoo.\n\nA year and a half on, he is thrilled to be finally free of his daft eyelid doodles.\n\n\"The laser was worse pain than the tattoos but it was definitely worth it,\" he said. \n\n\"Dr McKeown is brilliant, spot-on. I thought I\u0027d have these things for life, but he knew exactly what to do. My mother and Tommy\u0027s mother weren\u0027t too impressed when they saw them and I took an awful lot of slagging, but thankfully, that\u0027s all died down now. You\u0027d really have to look closely to see any trace of them.\"\n\nSteven and his stag party pals had been in a Benidorm bar all afternoon when Steven decided to add the \u0027whata boutye\u0027 tattoo to his collection, which includes inking on his backside.\n\n\"When we came out of the bar, they all went for a walk down to the beach and I just ducked out and walked until I found the tattoo parlour,\" he recalled. \"I told them what I wanted and that was that.\n\n\"The fella wanted €60 (£54) for it but I only had €22, so that\u0027s what I gave him. It was probably a good job, because a more expensive tattoo would have been harder to remove.\"\n\nSteven had flown to Benidorm from Belfast for a three-night stay and admitted he \u0027lost count\u0027 of how much he had to drink before going under the needle.\n\nSteven is single, but can now use his brown eyes to woo the girls, instead of scaring them off.\n\n\"I think I\u0027ll have a better chance with them now,\" he said. \"And I\u0027ll not be getting inked again in a hurry, I\u0027ll tell you that.\"\n\nOver the last 18 months, he has undergone more than a dozen laser treatments on a bi-monthly basis, with dramatic results. The tattoo on his left eye is 95% gone the other is 97%, according to Dr McKeown.\n\n\"The laser breaks up the ink into very small particles and the body\u0027s own natural defence system removes it from the body,\" he explained. \"Steven has been a very good patient. \n\n\"I was concerned he\u0027d be prone to swelling and bruising at the start, as we were dealing with very delicate skin, but he tolerated the treatments well.\n\n\"Fortunately, Steven\u0027s tattoo was in a blue-black ink, which is easier to remove than other colours. I once had a patient with spider\u0027s web tattoo all over one side of his face - he was lucky it was done in the same sort of blue-black ink that can be broken down.\"\n\nA former west Belfast GP, Dr McKeown has removed hundreds of tattoos, including paramilitary slogans and insignia, over the last two decades.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37247553.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/pope_ireland_010.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts pope visit and local events set to cause disruption","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Irish dancing, classical music, children’s choirs as well as testimonies given by families from across the globe.\n\nIn turn Ireland welcomed a different pontiff to 1979, with Pope Francis opening his address to the Festival of Families in Dublin by saying “Dia Daoibh” – Irish for good evening.\n\nIn a light-hearted moment during proceedings, Francis consented to a selfie with a teenager from the Travelling community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis speaks to the audience at Croke Park stadium in Dublin (Brian Lawless/PA)\n\n\n\n\nCroke Park stadium was packed with an estimated 82,500 people on Saturday night for the event at which Pope Francis was the star, but he was not the only draw as country stars Daniel O’Donnell and Nathan Carter thrilled the crowd with their performances.\n\nPope Francis received an enthusiastic welcome as he arrived in the stadium and then did a lap of the pitch floor in a golf buggy, closely flanked by his security team.\n\nMembers of the audience rose to their feet, and some even stood on their chairs, for a better look as he passed giving smiles and waves.\n\nWhen the Pope took his seat, Cardinal Kevin Farrell offered him the traditional Irish greeting of a thousand welcomes.\n\nThe pontiff smiled as a group of children performed an Irish dance in front of him, and he exchanged a few words with the youngsters before 500 other children from dance schools around Ireland treated him to a performance of Riverdance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stadium was packed with tens of thousands of people (WMOF18/PA)\n\n\n\n\nCo Donegal crooner O’Donnell was next on stage and brought many in the audience to their feet and dancing with a rendition of Let Your Love Flow.\n\nThere were also powerful testimonies from a number of families, including Azeez Al-Kanah who recollected fleeing their home in Iraq after Islamic State invaded the village.\n\nThere were also strong words from Missy Collins of the Pavee Point Traveller group, who told the pontiff of the struggle of the Travellers for recognition and the value her community places on the importance of family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColourful performers entertained the crowds, and the Pope, during the event (WMOF18/PA)\n\n\n\n\nMore than 2,000 singers, dancers and performers took part in the festival, which organisers described as a “once-in-a-lifetime theatrical experience”, and it ran an hour over the scheduled finishing time of 8.30pm.\n\nDuring his address, Pope Francis paid tribute to all those who took part.\n\nAnd as he neared the conclusion of the first day of his two-day visit to Ireland, during which he also met President Michael D Higgins and survivors of clerical abuse amid a packed itinerary, he admitted he was tired.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed top 10 baby names

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein boycott of westminster would make it difficult to impose direct rule","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We are saying that, insofar as it lies within our powers, we will take steps to ensure trade flows freely - what we can\u0027t do is speak for the Government in Ireland about what they would do in the event of a no deal.\"\n\nBrian McGrath, vice president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce and chief executive of Foyle Port, said: \"The engagement gave us the chance to impress upon the Minister the uniqueness of the area and the importance of the City Deal for the region in creating prosperity for the next 20 years. \n\n\"The City Deal offers a positive and sustained opportunity for economic and social development and we look forward to the Minister relaying those messages back to his cabinet colleagues before the next Budget.\"\n\nPSNI Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin met Mr Lidington during his visit to the police headquarters.\n\nHe later tweeted: \"Thanks to Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington for visiting @PoliceServiceNI Headquarters to discuss policing in Northern Ireland and Brexit. Grateful he took the time to visit both our PSNI and RUC Gardens of Remembrance.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500000 expected to attend outdoor mass with","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

decision to address the dark legacy of abuse in a speech in Dublin Castle drew praise in some quarters, but others criticised Francis for not saying enough or offering a public apology.\n\nWith the reverberations of a litany of clerical sex crimes casting a shadow over the first papal visit to Ireland in almost 40 years, Francis acknowledged the gravity of what had happened.\n\n“With regard to the most vulnerable, I cannot fail to acknowledge the grave scandal caused in Ireland by the abuse of young people by members of the church charged with responsibility for their protection and education,” he said.\n\n“The failure of ecclesiastical authorities – bishops, religious superiors, priests and others – adequately to address these repellent crimes has rightly given rise to outrage and remains a source of pain and shame for the Catholic community.\n\n“I myself share those sentiments.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis shakes hands with Br Kevin Crowley (WMOF18/Maxwell/PA)\n\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, the Pope also visited homeless people who receive support from a centre run by the Capuchin Fathers’ religious order.\n\nIn his Dublin Castle speech, the pontiff also expressed hope that remaining obstacles to reconciliation in Northern Ireland could be overcome.\n\nIreland has undergone seismic social changes in the four decades since the last papal visit in 1979, when John Paul II was lauded by a nation shaped by its relationship with an all-powerful Catholic Church.\n\nBut the church’s response to clerical sex abuse scandals, most of which emerged years after John Paul II’s visit, have severely damaged trust in the religious institution and seriously weakened its influence on Irish society.\n\nWhile thousands lined the streets of the capital to catch a glimpse of Francis passing in his famous Popemobile on Saturday afternoon, the crowds were certainly not on the scale witnessed when John Paul II made a similar trip.\n\nAnd among the well-wishers lining Dublin’s streets there were also protesters, who vented their anger at the pontiff as he drove by.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"pope calls for revolution of love across globe","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo

He asked that we pray for him.\n\n“He was very humble. His speech was awe-inspiring and he was very calm and modest and we absorbed every word that he said.”\n\nHer new husband said it was a “great privilege” to welcome Pope Francis to the cathedral.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancis leads prayers at St Mary’s Pro-Cathedral (WMOF18/PA)\n\n\n\n\nHe added: “We were also given the great honour of having a conversation with him and he was able to bless the two of us and give us a gift.\n\n“I think his speech was very personal, he told two anecdotes from his past. One about how when he was a five-year-old, he walked in on his parents embracing.\n\n“You can tell, in terms of the theme of the week, that family is very important to him. It was a lovely story and he really highlighted how parents can instil in their children the importance of faith.\n\n“He was very humble and relaxed in the chapel and he got a great reception.\n\n“He also gave us a blessing as a married couple.”\n\nPeadar and Ciara Kelly, from Co Roscommon and Tralee respectively, got married two months ago.\n\nCiara described how the “special service” meant a lot to them, and she shared the piece of advice he passed on.\n\n“He said not to go to bed on an argument, which I think is very true,” she said.\n\n“He stood very close to us and it was a great privilege and honour to be part of it.”\n\nPeadar added: “I thought he was very down to earth, he spoke about faith and keeping our faith and kept stressing that it all starts in the home.\n\n“He also said that if we have kids to make sure we bring faith and courage into their lives.”\n\nAs the Pope left the cathedral, he shook hands with those who had gathered for the event.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say august","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

New Zealand, were given the old fishing boat to change up their enclosure and keep them interested in their surroundings.\n\nThe pair were brought to the zoo to be rehabilitated but couldn’t be

obstacle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeper Odin Neil even donned his diving gear to teach them how to swim through it.\n\nThe zoo said: “It’s important that we enhance their behaviours and environments, encouraging them to act as they would in the wild.\n\n“This can mean making them forage for their food, taking them for walks, changing up their environment, and giving them toys and puzzles that encourage them to play, think and use their strength.”\n\nThe zoo said its keepers are always looking for new ways to enhance their animals’ lives with new objects, textures and

But while those rules remain the accepted British conventions, they remain just that: convention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dave Thompson/PA)\n\n\n\n\nDenis Hurley is the original founder of squadnumbers, a website dedicated entirely to the digits players have worn for almost a century. And while there are historical guidelines for the numbers certain players should and shouldn’t wear, the modern game offers a lot of wiggle room.\n\n“For years (right-back) Glen Johnson had been wearing number eight at Stoke, while (centre-back) William Gallas came in straight after Dennis Bergkamp and wore the number 10 at Arsenal,” said Hurley. “It is strange to see someone not conforming to the accepted system.”\n\nMany positions these days are more fluid, with ever-evolving formations creating new roles. But even so, some rules remain unbreakable in the eyes of fans.\n\n“Number nine playing somewhere other than centre-forward looks wrong,” said Hurley. “I remember when Paul Ince was with Middlesbrough he wore number nine as a defensive midfielder.\n\n“I don’t mind maybe as much if it’s a striker who has morphed into an attacking midfielder, but number nine really has to be the central striker.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(PA)\n\n\n\n\nBut it’s not just numbers one to 11 that players can choose from. These days, depending on the league you play in, the higher numbers are available, and one bugbear in particular of Hurley’s is the move from a lower number to a higher one.\n\n“I noticed the other day Alvaro Morata has moved from nine to 29 for Chelsea this season because he had twins born on July 29,” said Denis.\n\n“Furthermore, when Luke Shaw moved to Manchester United he was given number three, and it seemed like, here’s the left-back for United and England for the next 15 years.\n\n“The following season Tom Cleverly left, and Shaw opted to move from three to 23. For me, as a traditionalist players should always aspire to wear a 1-11 number, but you have to accept that that’s not always the case nowadays.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Gareth Fuller/PA)\n\n\n\n\nOf course, at least in those situations the numbers are still being worn. One well-observed tradition at some clubs is to retire the numbers of legendary players, such as Paolo Maldini’s number three shirt at AC Milan. Hurley thinks that’s a counter productive measure to take.\n\n“Effectively it’s the club saying: ‘We’ll never have a player ever again who’s worthy enough to wear this number,’ rather than saying: ‘We will have players good enough, and maybe even better players, and let’s bestow this great number upon them.\u0027” said Hurley.\n\n“In Spain they have a one-to-25 rule. You pick a 25-man squad and you number them one to 25 so there’s no wiggle room for retiring numbers.\n\n“Number 10 at Barcelona was Rivaldo, then Ronaldinho, and now Lionel Messi. It’s handed down from one star to the next. You give the younger guys something to aspire to.\n\n“Some players do find it too heavy a burden, and I suppose that just shows that even though it’s just a shape on your back, there is more to it. It does carry meaning.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Nick Potts/PA)\n\n\n\n\nAsk football fans all over the world what they would change about the game, and they’d likely give you a different answer wherever you went. But for a squad number enthusiast, what would they change about the numbers on the back of the top?\n\n“If I was in charge of the Premier League I would try to put in a one-to-25 rule like Spain,” said Hurley. “It’s better wanting to wear 20 all the time than wanting to wear 46.\n\n“You could be stricter and insist a number three has to be a left back and a number seven has to be a right winger, but I suppose that would probably be going too far.”\n\n\nTo read more on the intricacies of the world of football squad numbers, click \nhere\n.\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"zimbabwe opposition leader rejects ruling upholding election result","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But Mr Chamisa now alleges “a new persecution” after a deadly crackdown on the opposition.\n\nThe 40-year-old opposition leader again said he won the election and that the southern African nation needs fundamental reforms that cannot be resolved by five more years of “vacant leadership”.\n\nMr Mnangagwa, 75, a former Mugabe enforcer who has tried to restyle himself as a reformer, appealed for calm after the court ruling and in a Twitter post he told Mr Chamisa “my door is open and my arms are outstretched”.\n\nZimbabwe’s electoral commission had declared Mr Mnangagwa the winner of the July 30 ballot with 50.8% of the vote. It later revised it to 50.6%, citing an “error” but arguing it was not significant enough to invalidate the win.\n\nIt said Mr Chamisa received 44.3%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmerson Mnangagwa will be inaugurated as Zimbabwe’s president on Sunday (Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi/AP)\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, final reports are pending from dozens of Western election observers invited to the country for the first time in nearly two decades.\n\nThey noted few issues on election day but expressed concern over “excessive use of force” that followed. Six people were killed two days after the vote when the military swept into the capital Harare to disperse protests.\n\nMr Mnangagwa has said an inquiry would begin after his inauguration.\n\nA new statement by the joint mission of the US-based International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute noted the “acts of repression” against the opposition and said it was up to the people of Zimbabwe “to weigh the court’s ruling in light of the overall electoral process to determine the credibility of the election”.\n\nThe statement concluded: “Zimbabwe has not yet demonstrated that it has established a tolerant, democratic culture that enables the conduct of elections in which parties are treated equitably and citizens can cast their vote freely.” A final report is yet to come.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"city derry airport celebrate ryanairs new derry edinburgh route free flight giveaway","story":"\nCity of Derry Airport is offering its customers the chance to win one pair of return Ryanair flights to Edinburgh on their social media channels. \n\nThe lucky winner (and their travel partner) will enjoy an enchanting city break where they can explore the rich culture of the Scottish capital.\n\nTour the famous Castle, visit Edinburgh Dungeon, shop ‘til you drop for Christmas on Princes Street or soak up the fun in the cosy restaurants and bars.

If not, then they will fail to absorb and highlight, the true spirit of \u002768.”\n\nMr McKinney questioned why an application for the parade was put forward as early as March and whether Sinn Féin felt major civil rights\u0027 concerns, ‘not least a non-functioning government resulting in adverse social consequences, were irrelevant and had no great immediacy?’\n\nHe pointed to the significance of that date in Derry and the north’s history which is recognised by lowly-paid, unemployed, homeless and the disenfranchised as a ‘a turning point for radical political, social and economic reforms in Northern Ireland.’\n\n“October 5th 1968,” he explained, “is a date linked to an era of hope when pro-democracy citizens banded together to achieve equality for all sections of our population, following the examples of Gandhi and Dr. Martin L. King. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027244566\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\n“If this historic analysis is distorted by sectarianism it will transpire that there are no limits on what this organisation would do to \u0027legitimize\u0027 themselves.\n\n“The NICRA was a non-party political cross-community organisation which gave the people of Northern Ireland an aspiration that radical change was possible. It created a vehicle whereby all were enabled to participate in a non-violent manner.\n\n“It seems blatantly partisan for one political group, rather than adopting a broad-front approach to contemporary issues, to proceed with a demonstration that suggests an opportunistic attempt to usurp the date and message of NICRA in 1968.\n\n“If that is the case, as many former campaigners and others from a wide range of backgrounds believe, then they should be ashamed of distorting a seminal moment in the history of this place to attract short-sighted populist gain via unpredictable media attention, alongside the inherent dangers, e.g. uncontrollable violent elements.”\n\nIn response Sinn Féin provided a statement from Tyrone MP Francie Molloy who said the party ‘were and remain’ at the forefront of civil rights and social justice campaigns. \n\nHe commented: “Fifty years ago, likeminded people from all communities, including republicans – outraged by the routine injustice and sectarianism of the six county state - came together to form the Civil Rights movement.\n\n“To mark the 50th anniversary of the civil rights march in Derry, Sinn Féin have organised a commemorative march from Duke Street to Guildhall Square, along the original planned route of the march. \n\n“Republicans were to the fore of and remain to the fore of civil rights and social justice campaigns. We would welcome anyone who feels the same to join us.”\n\nSurviving leaders and supporters of the original march were said to have met last November in Belfast City Hall where they decided on a programme of events.\n\nIt is noteworthy, Mr McKinney said, that \u002768 veterans at the initial meeting unanimously voted down a public commemorative demonstration ‘to avoid what may have been interpreted as a coat-trailing exercise’ thereby avoiding any possible violence on the streets. \n\n“It was agreed that such incidents would be highly injurious to the civil rights\u0027 cause, with resultant harmful images of our struggling city and general population, via regional and global media,” he said.\n\nA three-day programme of events will run at the Guildhall from October 4-7 to mark the international Civil Rights Festival, commemorating the 50th Anniversary of Duke Street Civil Rights March, which will see the Irish President Michael D Higgins make a keynote address.\n\nThe event was launched by 50th Anniversary Civil Rights Commemoration Committee last week, and will explore the civil rights\u0027 legacy through documentation, conferences, films and other educational activities.\n\n\nABOVE - Aidan McKinney, far right, pictured with some of the key figures of the Civil Rights Movement with then then President Mary McAleese during her visit to the Guildhall in Derry to mark the 40th anniversary in October 2008.
