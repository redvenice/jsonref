This photograph was taken by Gijsbert Hanekroot, the Netherlands\u0027 premier rock photographer at the time, who said that Bowie was his favourite musician to work with. On one occasion in 1971, Hankeroot told of how he bumped into Bowie in a canteen while he was working on lyrics for Ziggy Stardust and asked his opinion on one of the lines          Bob Dylan photographed at Madison Square Garden in New York, 1974. Hankeroot managed to inset himself in the midst of a heady time in both music and culture, living the rockstar lifestyle by proxy as he flew all over the world to photograph its biggest stars. \u0027We saw The Eagles in London, Paul McCartney in south of France, Bob Dylan in New York and the Stones in Hamburg. We visited London every two months. It was the most natural thing in the world,\u0027 he said          John Lennon and Yoko Ono photographed in Selfridges on Oxford Street in 1971. Hankeroot was best-known for working in low-light settings, such as concert halls and music venues, so this is one of his rarer daylight shots. He used darkroom techniques that lent a grainy texture to the pictures he took, which is particularly visible on the faces of his subjects          Keith Richards, of the Rolling Stones, smoke a cigarette somewhere in Belgium, 1976. Hankeroot was recognised for his talent in his own time, working for Dutch magazine Oort, but he left the field of music photography in the 80s and his work has gone ingored. But he is now opening a new show in Hong Kong to display a retrospective of his works          Lou Reed lights a cigarette in Amsterdam, 1972. Hankeroot liked to spend as much time as possible with his subjects, staying the full length of their set if they were playing, or \u0027until the subject was bored of me\u0027, if they were in a studio. \u0027That\u0027s the moment that he or she would stop acting or posing, those often became the best pictures,\u0027 he said  Neil Young slumps on a sofa in his hotel  in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1976 (left) while Patti Smith poses during a photo shoot in Amsterdam, exact date unknown (right). Hankeroot tried to embody the same spirit of reinvention and innovation that the musicians put into their songs in his photography, searching for new way to capture and define the seminal decade in art          Leonard Cohen, photographed on a cobbled street among pigeons, somewhere in Amsterdam in 1974.  Hankeroot was deeply embedded in the musical culture of the 1970s, by the time the following decade rolled around he decided to pursue \u0027other adventures\u0027, and now works mostly as a street photographer and documentary-maker          Frank Zappa photographed in Amsterdam in 1972. Though Hankeroot was born in Brussels, in neighbouring Belgium, he grew up in the Netherlands where he was given his first camera aged 13. At 16 he dropped out of school to pursue photography full-time and got an internship with Philip Mechanicus, where he learned to take portraits          Bryan Ferry at the Amstel Hotel in Amsterdam, 1976. At the time, Ferry had just released Let\u0027s Stick Together, his first solo album since Roxy Music disbanded for the first time earlier the same year. He would release In Your Mind the following year and The Bride Stripped Bare the year after that before Roxy Music reformed          Photographers crowd around Mick Jagger, who is behind the camera in the shot, as they try to get a picture of him in Hamburg, Germany, in 1970          Hankeroot began digitising his archives years ago which led to the publication of Abba...

It really isn’t’: Gary Lineker...Share this article    Missing soccer star Emiliano Sala booked his own \u0027risky\u0027 private flight across the English Channel after turning down a commercial flight from Cardiff City, it was revealed today.The £15million player was offered a flight from bosses at new club Cardiff City but wanted to make his own travel arrangements from his former club in Nantes.City chairman Mehmet Dalman (pictured) said they were \u0027still praying\u0027 for positive news but are devastated after Sala\u0027s plane disappeared on Monday night.Sala, 28, was due to join his teammates in South Wales yesterday morning for training but never arrived after his 460-mile journey from Nantes to Cardiff Airport.The plane disappeared over the Channel Islands and search teams have found no sign of a wreckage or survivors.But Mr Dalman said Sala the flight on the Piper Malibu plane - which experts described as \u0027risky\u0027 - was not booked by the club.Mr Dalman said: \u0027We spoke to the player and asked him if he wanted us to make arrangements for his flight which, quite frankly, would have been commercial. He declined and made his own arrangements.\u0027I can\u0027t tell you who arranged the flight because I don\u0027t know at this stage - but it certainly wasn\u0027t Cardiff City.\u0027He revealed that Cardiff\u0027s hard man manager Neil Warnock was \u0027in a state of shock\u0027 after hearing the news.                                                    The model was born in the Tres de Febrero area of the Argentine capital Buenos Aires and is believed to have been going out with the footballer for a few months last year. Reports in their home country suggest they may even have been engaged before they split up. Guernsey Police said today they are \u0027prioritising\u0027 the theory that the new £15million Cardiff City player and the pilot made it out of the wreckage found floating in the Channel last night.They are also working on three other possibilities - that the plane was grounded on dry land either in the Channel Islands or France, the pilot and Sala were picked up by a passing ship or they are dead in the water.It came as aviation experts claimed that the Piper Malibu plane that Sala was travelling in had a \u0027questionable\u0027 safety record with 55 fatal crashes including 24 since 2000.Former pilot Alastair Rosenschein said the plane may have become iced-up in the Arctic blast currently sweeping across northern Europe including the UK and France.He said: \u0027It\u0027s already a fairly risky crossing to do in a single engine aircraft, especially in winter and definitely at night. There are icing problems too. It\u0027s a strange thing to do though to go and fly over water with one engine at night in winter because if your engine goes you\u0027re going in the water\u0027. French media had reported pilot David Henderson, 60, was flying the missing Piper Malibu PA-46, which disappeared near the Channel Islands on Monday night.Mr Henderson later took to Facebook to confirm he was alive and well and it is unknown who was flying the missing PA-46.But in 2015, Mr Henderson appeared in a BBC video about his life as a transatlantic pilot and described the dangers of flying a Piper Malibu.In fact, Mr Henderson told how he would always wear a neoprene wetsuit and packed a life raft in the back to give him \u00276 or 7 or 8 hours survivability\u0027 in case he ditched into the Atlantic.He is filmed sitting in the cockpit of a plane - serial number N264DB - the same as that of the missing flight, according to reports on the Aviation Safety Network Wiki page.According to South Wales Aviation Group that same plane - a 1984 Piper serial number N264DB - took off from Rhoose, near Cardiff, on Saturday destined for Guernsey, presumed to be en route to France.Speaking to the BBC in 2015, Mr Henderson described the potential problems with the plane.\u0027One of the problems we can encounter is that ice can build up on the surfaces of the aircraft,\u0027 Mr Henderson explains.\u0027On the propeller and the wings and if it gets too great the aeroplane would ultimately stop flying.\u0027And the only way in most of the aeroplanes we fly to get rid of ice is to descend into warmer air and the ice will dissipate\u0027.

I\u0027m going to Cardiff now, crazy, and tomorrow we get going.

It is expected to resume today at first light.In a statement Guernsey Police said: \u0027During the course of the 15-hour search, which used multiple air and sea assets from the Channel Islands, UK and France, a number of floating objects have been seen in the water. \u0027We have been unable to confirm whether any of these are from the missing aircraft.\u0027We have found no signs of those on board.

And without a secure and confident capital base, a bank cannot conduct its business with any confidence.\u0027It was this confidence that had evaporated in the banking sector in 2007 and 2008.\u0027In June 2008 - so, getting to the early summer of that year - there was a significant need to increase the capital base at Barclays.\u0027  Thomas Kalaris and Richard Boath are also facing fraud charges and are seen arriving at Southwark Crown Court today By autumn of 2008, the need to increase capital was being imposed by the Government, Mr Brown told the court.  \u0027Some United Kingdom banks had been forced into Government hands, as a Government bailout was all that they could turn to,\u0027 he said. \u0027Those at the top of Barclays were very anxious to avoid accepting Government money, thereby placing itself under greater Government control and scrutiny.\u0027It is no exaggeration to say that Barclays\u0027 future as an independent bank was in jeopardy in September and October of 2008.\u0027He said the board, which included Varley, was \u0027determined to avoid taking Government funds, convinced that doing so would render Barclays restricted in its flexibility and constrained by Government policy\u0027.Mr Brown said the further investment in the bank was to be achieved through \u0027capital raisings\u0027, a process which involved shares and other financial instruments in the bank being sold to an investor or investors at a particular price per share.He added: \u0027As is normal in such capital raisings, the investors were to be paid a fee for making their investments.\u0027In the capital raisings we are concerned with in this case, all investors are paid at the same percentage commission fee for their investment.\u0027The overall figures involved are very considerable indeed as you might expect.\u0027In June 2008, the capital raising undertaken by Barclays secured £4.4 billion.          Varley (right) leaving Southwark Crown Court on January 14 \u0027In October 2008, when further shoring up of Barclays\u0027 capital ratios was imposed upon it, it raised a total of £6.8 billion.\u0027As we shall see, during these capital raisings, the Qataris in particular - through the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and Qatar Holding - the Qataris made what were very substantial investments in Barclays to shore up their capital base: approximately £1.9 billion in June 2008 and £2.05 billion in November 2008 when the Qatari money was essential.\u0027Those within the bank at that time commented that without it the consequences would be dire - for the bank and personally.\u0027Mr Brown told the jury that when a capital raising of this type takes place, there is an obligation on a bank to tell the shareholders, the investors and the wider market what has taken place.\u0027As all those involved in transactions of this nature know, there is a legal requirement that the information published by Barclays in this case is honest and accurate. That will be no surprise to you of course.\u0027It ensures that there is transparency and that existing investors, prospective investors and the wider market are properly informed about what has happened.\u0027All experienced bankers know about the fundamental principles attaching to the contents of such public-facing documents, not least that they must contain the truth and must not mislead.\u0027In this case, in addition to the amounts which Barclays revealed that it was paying to the investors in the public-facing documents, additional commission fees for investing were paid to the Qataris ... that were not paid to other investors and were not revealed.\u0027It is the hiding of these additional commission fees which lies at the heart of this case and the conspiracies alleged against the defendants, disguising and hiding extra fees to the tune, ultimately, of a total of nearly a third of a billion pounds, £322 million.\u0027Mr Brown said the commission fees were hidden in two agreements described as Advisory Service Agreements (ASAs).He said: \u0027The evidence demonstrates that the Qataris drove a hard bargain.\u0027Mr Brown explained that they received more than double the commission fee of other investors in the bank.The court heard that when a capital raising takes place the bank is obliged to tell shareholders, investors and the wider market.He explained this process of \u0027disclosure\u0027 is made through public documents, the key one being a Prospectus.He said: \u0027The Prospectuses contained statements as to the amounts of fees and commissions being paid to investors, and the overall costs of the capital raisings, which took no account of the fees payable under the ASAs. Public announcements made by Barclays were to the same effect.\u0027Likewise, Subscription Agreements made between Barclays, and the Qataris and other key investors in both capital raisings referred only to the disclosed fees and commissions and contained warranties to the effect that there were no other fees or commissions payable by Barclays in connection with the investments being made.\u0027Say the prosecution, in respect of the Qatari investment, that was plainly a lie.\u0027Mr Brown said the Prosecution claims that each of the defendants entered into the agreements alleged against them with the intention that one or more of their number would make the false representation that the only fees payable to the Qataris for their investments were the fees disclosed in the Prospectuses and Subscription Agreements.          The accusations of wrongdoing at Barclays date to around the time of the financial crisis  \u0027What matters is whether that each of the iniduals entered into the criminal agreement with the intent that the offence of fraud by false representations would be committed by one or more of their number.\u0027As a matter of law, once they had entered into that agreement, that criminal agreement, the offence is complete. Nothing in fact need be done in pursuit of that agreement,\u0027 he said.Mr Brown added that in this case the agreement was brought into effect because the false representations were made to the other investors. \u0027The evidence demonstrates that each of the iniduals joined in the conspiracies alleged against them and when they did, they intended that the offences of fraud by false representations would be made by one or more of the conspirators,\u0027 he said.Mr Brown told the jury: \u0027The conspiracies to make false representations were entered into with the intention that by making the false representations, the conspirators would make gain for themselves or another, cause loss to another or at the very least, expose another to the risk of loss.\u0027What that means on the facts of this case is that the conspirators intended, principally, that Barclays would gain by the making of the false representations.\u0027Barclays would gain because it would secure the Qatari investment, on the terms demanded by the Qataris, without revealing the true position to other investors and the wider market.\u0027He said this meant that Barclays would gain by avoiding paying others at the same rate.\u0027By depriving the other investors of knowing the truth, at the very least it exposed those other investors to a risk of loss.\u0027Had they known about the true position, contrary to the intention of the conspirators, the other investors may not have chosen to invest at all, or, more likely, would have demanded the same terms as the Qataris.\u0027By making the false representations, hiding the true position, they denied the other investors the opportunity to make that decision for themselves.\u0027That, at the very least, say the Crown, exposed them to the risk of loss.\u0027The loss being that they invested in Barclays when they may not have chosen to do so, or not on the terms that they did, had they known the true position,\u0027 he said.Mr Brown said the bank also stood to gain by \u0027avoiding looking weak to the market by for example having to pay all investors at the higher rate, and it would gain by securing the capital raisings as a whole\u0027.The defendants themselves also had personal motivations, namely their jobs and potentially \u0027very large bonuses\u0027, the court heard.The jury was told: \u0027The security of their jobs and the very large bonuses that they might receive in addition to their salaries were in jeopardy if the future and the security of the bank was in doubt, or placed in the hands of the UK Government.\u0027Varley, 62, of west London, Jenkins, 63, of Malibu, California, Boath, 60, of Henley-on-Thames, and Kalaris, 63, of south-west London, are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation in relation to Barclays\u0027 June 2008 capital raising.Varley and Jenkins are charged with a second count of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation in relation to Barclays\u0027 October 2008 capital raising.Jenkins is a former executive chairman of investment banking and investment management in the Middle East and North Africa, Barclays Capital.Boath is former Barclays Capital head of European Financial Institutions Group.Kalaris is former chief executive of Barclays wealth management. The four men deny the charges against them."},{"url":null,"title":"Theresa Mays deal acceptable Brexit outcome voters","story":"    Research by Number Cruncher Politics found Theresa May\u0027s prosed Brexit deal was the least isive for votersMeanwhile, no-deal Brexit was backed by 45 per cent and unacceptable to 39 per cent. But by contrast.

Did I sense any regret about the situation he’d left behind? Not really’ This picture has actually lost me a few jobs. Plus I think I might even have lost a flat because of it. I was looking at a property and was chatting to the estate agent and told them that I’d recently shot David Cameron. We put an offer in – for the asking price – but it was turned down. So yes, I do suspect people don’t like David Cameron.But when you shoot someone like Cameron, though, you have to remain neutral. If you turn up thinking too many things then you’ll inevitably forget something, or position the lighting wrong, and the subject will get irritated. You have to go in with clarity. Whether you’re a former prime minister or a bus driver, I’ll always have the same clarity of thought.The photograph came about as part of a project I was working on, aiming to capture interesting faces in the style of artists such as Holbein and Caravaggio. It took place in Cameron’s office, almost exactly one year after his resignation. My degree is in medieval history, and so shooting people who are part of our history like this gives me an excuse to touch history.He arrived in his gym clothing, which was rather funny, and he was worried he looked a bit pasty. I explained my ideas, and about how I wanted to capture this sort of meditative statesman feeling. I wanted a sense of looking backwards at the current political situation.I was worried that Cameron might be a difficult person to photograph, but as a sitter he proved to be a darling. He had a lot of patience. You have to separate politics from the person, and he was a charming chap.I knew the public would be wondering, what is he thinking? That’s why I wanted him in this pose, shot in profile. There are no other pictures of Cameron like this – the others normally capture the signature “call me Dave” look. But now he’s not in power he can afford to show more emotion and try different poses.I do think the contemplation was genuine. I’ve worked with a lot of actors in Los Angeles so I know what faking it looks like. I’ve also worked with many politicians, both Conservative and Labour, and when I ask for a certain look, some of them can turn around instantly with that expression. But David seemed to me a genuine guy, a family man, who had a real sense of the seriousness of office. Did I sense any regret about the situation he’d left behind? Not really.However, I never mentioned the B-word during the half hour we had for the sitting. I decided that wouldn’t have been a good idea. But he seemed very happy to talk about other things throughout his career. He told me that the most interesting place he’d visited was Libya after Gaddafi.I was inspired by Sir James Guthrie, the realist painter who depicted a lot of politicians straight after the first world war. They’d experienced all that horror and history, and he captured that moment. Backdrops are important for me. Guthrie painted in a muddy brown, suggestive of the trenches. I went with a fading blue backdrop. You can interpret that as the European flag fading away, or simply as the blue of Conservatism.I’m a realist photographer so I like to capture everything – the grey hairs, blotchy skin, all the details and lines. I want to say – this was the true image of David Cameron at this moment in history.He’s not the first leader I’ve photographed – I did John Major back in 2017 for another project. When I went to shoot him there was a sense of betrayal there. It was in his mouth, in his breath. But with David there was not that sense. He was energetic, almost raring to go. There was a restlessness I could really sense. I think he wants to return after this Brexit situation is resolved. I think he’ll be back.Born: Chester, 1982.Training: King’s College London.Influences: Caravaggio, Titian, Ribera, HolbeinHigh point: ‘Sir Patrick Stewart portrait sitting, New York.’Low point: ‘Not picking up a camera after I graduated.’Top tip: ‘Direction, direction, direction: break the ice with your subjects.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5db7d3c5eab855f127b143508de873833b882b8f/0_0_2255_2550/master/2255.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=1c01946982f1bbc92aeea116bf3d5f50","title":"patisserie valerie cafes shut old compton street london","story":"Chain’s original outlet in London’s Soho among those closed at cost of 920 jobsThe administrators running the collapsed Patisserie Valerie have said they are “hopeful of a positive outcome” for the remains of the business even though 71 outlets – including the cafe chain’s original outlet – closed on Wednesday with the loss of 920 jobs.Patisserie Valerie on Old Compton Street in London, which has been trading since the 1940s, closed on Tuesday night, along with 51 of the chain’s other outlets including concessions in Debenhams and Next.

In one extreme case, an Africa-based thinktank questioned whether the link between cancer and smoking “was yet to be empirically established”, before backing away from the claim.Patricio Marquez, lead specialist on health global practice at the World Bank, said such activity could impact public health efforts. The thinktanks “have created an arsenal of evidence in order to influence policy-making and decision-making”, he said.In this network more than a fifth either argued against controls in some way, took industry donations, or both. Additionally:At least 53 free-market thinktanks accepted donations from major tobacco companies, according to tobacco companies documents and disclosures made to the . When asked, most thinktanks declined or failed to respond to requests to disclose donors.At least 25 free-market thinktanks opposed tobacco taxes, arguing they were “ineffective”, regressive or increased smuggling. In some cases, anti-tax campaigns are extensive, even though experts said taxes “are widely recognised as the most effective means” to reduce smoking.At least 30 free-market thinktanks were among 47 signatories to a letter from thinktanks to the WHO opposing plain packaging in 2016. And at least 14 free-market thinktanks wrote to the FDA in support of a Philip Morris International application to sell its IQOS devices in the US.Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco (BAT), Japan Tobacco, Altria and Reynolds American all have donated to free-market thinktanks analyzed by the . In responses from manufacturers, they strongly disputed any suggestion donations could influence thinktank output.Some of the thinktanks are highly influential in their countries and well-connected, and some have received funding from diplomatic outposts. In the US, the Heritage Foundation, Cato Institute and Americans for Tax Reform all accepted donations from the tobacco industry and went on to comment on tobacco policy. In the UK, the Adam Smith Institute and the Institute of Economic Affairs did the same.For example, the Heritage Foundation accepted donations from US Marlboro maker Altria in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016. In 2018, a Heritage scholar testified before the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in favor of the new Philip Morris International product IQOS, which heats but does not burn tobacco, arguing it had an “impressive track record”.In responses to questions from the , the thinktanks said they are fiercely independent, unswayed by any donations, and they argue pro-business, low regulation and taxation positions as part of a broader free market philosophy. Some said they were not against all tobacco controls, hailed the rise of e-cigarettes in wealthier markets and said they were against “regressive” taxation on cigarettes they said hurts those on low incomes.Thinktanks exist to influence policy, often through policy guidance seen as independent of the interests of business and politics. Unlike lobbyists, thinktanks are not obligated to disclose their funding. However, the thinktank world has come under scrutiny in recent years, as donations from foreign governments and corporations came to light. In some cases, thinktanks appeared to operate like an echo chamber, with organizations within the network supporting one another’s research to reach similar conclusions.Plain packaging laws remove advertising from cigarette packs to encourage smokers to quit and deter young people from picking up the habit. The laws are part of a broader movement worldwide to control tobacco use.Australia first enacted plain packaging in 2012, and immediately found itself in the crosshairs of the tobacco industry, which argued plain packaging violated international trade agreements, infringed on commercial speech and are ineffective at reducing smoking. This  analysis shows tobacco companies also funded free-market thinktanks, many of which opposed plain packaging.Tobacco taxes increase the price of cigarettes, meant to encourage smokers to quit and make cigarettes unaffordable to young people. Taxes are the most effective, yet least utilized, tobacco control tool. The biggest hurdle to enacting taxes, experts say, is the tobacco industry’s well-funded opposition.In Montana alone, on America’s rural western plains, cigarette manufacturers spent nearly $85 for every smoker in the state to convince voters not to increase taxes by $2 a pack. The cigarette makers’ campaign succeeded, even though the money would have paid for healthcare for the poor and disabled.Cigarette makers argue tobacco taxes fuel black market smuggling and counterfeit production. In turn, cigarette companies and their allies say increased tobacco taxes cause violence, revenue loss and lead to more harmful cigarettes. Tobacco control experts have found companies exaggerate smuggling evidence, and groups such as the Fraser Institute often echo those concerns.In one study example, an International Agency for Research in Cancer expert panel found tax avoidance does not wipe out the public health benefits of increased tobacco taxes. In another example, researchers from the International Union Against Cancer suggested “tobacco manufacturers are the chief beneficiaries of smuggling”.Clean indoor air laws ban smoking inside, because secondhand smoke can cause smoking-related illnesses. Tobacco companies oppose these laws on the grounds they negatively impact businesses, infringe on inidual rights and are based on junk science.Although thousands of bars, restaurants and workplaces ban smoking indoors in the US and Europe, many developing countries have not yet enacted these measures.  found several thinktanks used these arguments to oppose clean indoor air laws in places such as Ghana and Hong Kong.“Freedom of speech needs to be respected as long as everything is transparent,” said Marquez. “In that way, everybody is aware who you are representing. In the same way we do when we receive grants.”Free-market thinktanks took positions aligned with the tobacco industry in countries including the US, UK, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Georgia, Ireland, Spain, Serbia, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Honduras, Venezuela, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Ghana, South Africa, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.In Ghana, the executive director of a free-market thinktank argued in 2013 that the link between cancer and smoking “was yet to be empirically established”, a claim the organization backed away from when questioned by the . The group was also part of an organized group which opposed plain packaging. In filings to the WHO, Ghana’s health department said civil society groups cited the thinktank as one which “fronts for the tobacco industry”. The group told the  it accepted donations from the tobacco industry about four years ago.In Malaysia, a free-market thinktank called the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs (Ideas) argued against plain packaging and a proposed tobacco tax hike. The tax hike ultimately failed, as members of government cited concerns pushed by the thinktank about growth in smuggling. Public health experts said tobacco companies exaggerate the link between illicit trade and tobacco taxes. The thinktank disclosed in annual financials it received donations from the tobacco industry. Ideas said it follows “a strict policy of editorial independence” and that it did not consider its reliance on tobacco-funded research relevant.In Chile, a thinktank argued against new smoking restrictions, including an indoor smoking ban. Local journalists later obtained leaked documents which revealed the group was funded in part by BAT. BAT told the  it funded the organization by buying reports, which any company can do.Not all of the groups in the network that the  analyzed are active in tobacco policy, and some have done so in isolated instances. Some thinktanks issue policy papers around climate change skepticism, private education, pharmaceutical patent protections, energy deregulation and other conservative causes. In India, the  found one thinktank that made statements aligned with public health experts’ proposals for tobacco control.Atlas Network promotes its 475 “partner” thinktanks around the world, publicising campaigns and events on various issues, and providing some of this network with awards, grants and training.The bulk of Atlas’s work is unrelated to tobacco policy – in December 2018, for instance, the group promoted an American college student fighting to distribute the US constitution in Spanish and criticized a retail tax in Slovakia.It has, however, taken donations from tobacco firms in recent years and historically, and some Atlas partner thinktanks which have received grants have supported issues helpful to cigarette manufacturers. Some have also themselves taken tobacco industry donations.Atlas was founded in 1981 by Sir Antony Fisher, a British entrepreneur who found success factory farming chickens in the 1950s. Fisher then helped found the Institute for Economic Affairs, and went on to found Atlas Network. Since, Atlas worked to foster free-market thinktanks around the world on various issues, including promoting events by partner thinktanks.Like some of the thinktanks it supports, Atlas Network has history with the tobacco industry. Most thinktanks which received funding in the 1990s were “collaborators on public relations strategies or as allies in countering tobacco control efforts”, Smith said.In the 1990s, Philip Morris gave Atlas $275,000 for “ongoing activities”, and another $475,000 to Atlas for “tobacco issues management”. In 2001, Atlas Network received $75,000 from Philip Morris 2001, all according to the University of Bath database TobaccoTactics and documents obtained through tobacco litigation.Recently, Atlas Network accepted donations from British American Tobacco in 2015 and 2016, and from JTI-Macdonald Corp, Japan Tobacco’s Canadian subsidiary, in 2016. Its 2017 annual report showed no tobacco company contributions. has reached out to Atlas Network multiple times for comment, but received no response.In December, Atlas Network promoted on its website the opening of a branch of the Consumer Choice Center in Brazil, which Atlas said had opened in response to the Brazilian congress calling for plain packaging of cigarette packs.In another example, Atlas Network donated to the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs in Malaysia, which opposed plain packaging there. At the same time, the Malaysian thinktank was funded by local subsidiaries of Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco.Atlas Network accepted donations from BAT in 2015 and 2016, and from JTI-Macdonald Corp, Japan Tobacco’s Canadian subsidiary, in 2016. Its 2017 annual report showed no tobacco company contributions.“We definitely see there’s a growth of thinktanks in the developing world,” said Julia Smith, a research associate at Simon Fraser University in Canada who studies tobacco control and industry interference.Other researchers, such as Nobel prize-winning economist George Akerlof, said the growth of thinktanks aligned with the tobacco industry in the developing world “is exactly in line with what we would have expected” given the decline in smoking in the west. has contacted Atlas Network multiple times for comment but received no response.Researchers who study tobacco industry influence said organizations on both ends of the political spectrum have accepted tobacco donations, including civil rights groups and art organizations in the US.However, experts in tobacco influence said tobacco companies have recently favored libertarian and free market organizations, especially since the emergence of the American Tea Party movement about a decade ago.In most cases, the  relied on tobacco companies to disclose donations to thinktanks, rather than by the thinktanks themselves. Thinktanks are not obligated to disclose donors in the US, or in most countries around the world. Atlas Network voluntarily discloses names of donors, but not the amount of their donations.Manufacturers denied there was anything problematic about the behavior of thinktanks backing positions helpful to the industry. Altria, Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco (BAT), RJ Reynolds and Japan Tobacco International all donated to free-market thinktanks in the last decade.Philip Morris International told the  “ideas are not for sale”, a sentiment echoed by other tobacco companies. “We have worked, and will continue to work, with carefully selected organizations around the world who share our desire to promote policies that produce meaningful public health improvements,” PMI, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, said. “It is absolutely ridiculous to imply that supporting an organization would result in a group taking action they otherwise would fundamentally oppose.“Claims that our contributions to organizations committed to advancing positive change in public health create a conflict of interest cannot withstand any reasonable scrutiny, are irrational, and wrong,” the company said.Japan Tobacco International said: “Various groups across the world share our view that any regulation, tobacco-related or not, if untested and unproven, could have seriously negative knock-on effects.”The company continued: “It is clear to everyone that there are health risks associated with smoking – we are fully transparent about this. And, as such, it is important that tobacco products are regulated.”BAT told the : “Like many other companies, we support like-minded organisations on issues that are important to our business and our consumers.“We believe publicly elected officials should be allowed to hear all sides of any debate when formulating policy and should be trusted to make informed decisions once they have heard and considered all the arguments,” the company said.Altria, the US maker of Marlboro cigarettes and donor to dozens of North American thinktanks, said: “Like most major corporations, Altria and its companies support and are members of policy-oriented organizations focused on issues that affect our business.“These organizations, which include trade associations and other membership organizations, engage in activities such as educational initiatives, professional development and training, public policy research and outreach, and direct or grassroots lobbying,” the company said. “We develop and maintain partnerships with third-party organizations on issues important to our companies and that independently research, communicate and advocate on those issues.”Reynolds American Incorporated did not respond to  requests for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3adf5aa4ddd3c6d0eef8b221b20692dd9997a14b/0_8_2449_1469/master/2449.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88e48bcf9e1dff0b8aafcc9c4c1f8549","title":"which is the worlds most lgbt friendly city","story":"Even when cities seem progressive on the surface, the lived experience of members of the LGBT community can tell a dramatically different storyAmid a mass of colour and pounding Latin rhythms, revellers at this year’s Bogotá Pride march waved banners stating “not one step back”. They were among tens of thousands who took to the streets to celebrate and support Colombia’s LGBT community.Many annual Pride marches that were once solemn protests against repression have become celebrations of now-existing rights or progress, reflecting the strength of LGBT communities. In Bogotá, for example, the capital of a macho and socially conservative country, there has been surprising progress in LGBT rights.In March, Angélica Lozano Correa, a former member of the Bogotá city council, became the first openly LGBT person to be elected to the country’s Senate. In 2016 the country’s government passed laws allowing same-sex couples to adopt and marry, and the previous year it granted transgender people the right to change their identity on official government documents – policies which have allowed more equality and openness.But while these laws and political representation might suggest Bogotá is “friendly” and tolerant of the LGBT community, the issue is not clear-cut. This year’s Bogotá Pride march was marked by an undertone of resistance to and fear of the right-wing government of the new president, Ivan Duque.Duque openly opposes the LGBT-inclusive peace agreement his predecessor, Juan Manuel Santos, signed with leftist rebels Farc in 2016. Activists claim he is also against same-sex marriage and adoption rights.“Although the government promised there would be no setbacks to LGBT rights, the appointment of several anti-LGBT officials, cuts in resources for public policies and the continued strengthening of radical religious movements that promote hate speech and misinformation against the LGBT population are worrying,” says Marcela Sánchez, director of Colombia Diversa, a leading LGBT rights organisation.Indeed, determining a city’s attitude towards the LGBT community is complex. Studies that try to do this often look at political or legal metrics such as freedom to marry, or laws protecting against discrimination.Equaldex, a collaborative knowledge base for the global LGBT movement that maps the legality of homosexuality, identifies a number of factors including freedom to change gender and to adopt – although it hasn’t ranked countries or cities in order of best to worst.An index from the Human Rights Campaign looks at municipal services, law enforcement and the city leadership’s public position on equality across the US.Seventy-eight out of 506 US cities had a “perfect score” of 100, for reasons such as introducing trans-inclusive health benefits to city employees, as in Brookings, South Dakota. Birmingham, Alabama, obtained a full score for passing comprehensive nondiscrimination ordinances, along with other cities such as Cleveland in Ohio, a state that had previously prohibited same-sex marriage and civil unions.However, the Human Rights Campaign clearly states its index does not and cannot reflect a city’s friendliness.Other global surveys have tried to assess friendliness by covering public attitudes, access to nightlife and personal safety. A 2017 survey by the housing website Nestpick ranked the best LGBT cities by asking thousands of people how friendly they felt their city was based on safety and nightlife. Madrid, Amsterdam and Toronto came out as the top three.Arguably the size of the LGBT population in urban areas could reflect the level of friendliness, as “many LGBTI folk head to cities from rural areas because of the promise of a freer, more tolerant life there,” says André du Plessis, executive director of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association.But even when cities seem progressive on the surface, the lived experience of members of the LGBT community can tell a dramatically different story.Brazil’s second-largest city, Rio de Janeiro, has been branding itself as an LGBT tourist destination for years. It has made huge efforts in providing anti-bullying projects aimed at students, and has outlawed discrimination in nightclubs. However, the last year has seen record numbers of violent attacks against the queer community.And with a newly elected far-right government, there are fears it could get worse.Conversely, in some countries with backward and dangerous attitudes to the LGBT community, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, discreet but vibrant underground scenes can thrive. This is even the case in Russia, where activists say two people were killed last week and nearly 40 detained, as part of a new homophobic crackdown by police in the Chechnya region.“You’ll find a gay scene in many places that may surprise you,” says Ed Salvato, an LGBT travel expert. “Some places like Moscow and St Petersburghave vibrant gay communities, despite the homophobic laws there.”In Dublin, an exciting scene exploded out of a staunchly Catholic country.“Dublin is like gay Disneyland now, and that wasn’t the case 20 or 30 years ago,” says Prof Andrew Reynolds, founder of the University of North Carolina’s LGBTQ Representation and Rights Research Initiative.“With the last couple of referendums, Ireland and Dublin have embraced their new presentation as an inclusive, progressive and loving place.”He says: “They went to Australia. They went to America. Now they’ve come home.”The political glass ceiling has broken for many LGBT people across the world, which inevitably has ripple effects on the community. Minneapolis made US history last year by electing Andrea Jenkins, the first openly trans woman of colour to office in 2017. The gay stronghold of Palm Springs, California, has elected an entire city council that identifies as LGBT. And in November, Jared Polis became the first openly gay man to be elected as a US state governor.In Poland, one of Europe’s most Catholic and conservative countries, voters in the small city of Slupsk this year elected a gay atheist mayor, Robert Biedron. Just a few years ago, Biedron was attacked on the streets of his city because of his sexuality.In Kathmandu, Nepal, Sunil Pant became Asia’s first openly gay federal-level elected official in 2008, resulting in a spate of public scrutiny.“I think that the spinoff is that Kathmandu is a lot more gay-friendly than it was before,” says Reynolds. “Whilst it is not perfect by any stretch, like Bogotá, it is a place now that I feel like is much more friendly and accepting – and that’s obviously coming from a place where the Hindu religion was not helpful before.”As the most direct representatives of citizens, city officials are uniquely positioned to understand and address the needs of their communities, says Xavier Persad of the Human Rights Campaign, pointing to “the need to provide for one’s family without the fear of being fired, to secure housing without the fear of eviction, and to participate in community life”.“When cities enact LGBTQ-inclusive protections,” he adds, “they send a clear message that they value and welcome everyone, attracting the country’s top talent and spurring economic growth.”Ultimately, even the most progressive laws and equal representation at political levels do not necessarily reflect the efficiency of enforcement, or indeed capture the lived experience of discrimination and fear many LGBT people face every day.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04dc981106ad569046908624ba8a4897e7139225/182_274_2970_1781/master/2970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcd0c5fe1093cdcb3291d007a187a02f","title":"irish readers citizens assembly worked brexit","story":"Ireland’s assembly of 99 citizens found consensus on emotive issues – a model readers think could help the Brexit processWhile the Brexit debacle rumbles ever on, several outcomes are on the table, including the possibility of a second referendum. Some, including this newspaper, have suggested that if a second referendum were to happen, a way forward could be for the UK to follow the model adopted by Ireland to try and break the stalemate over an emotive issue that had dogged its politics for decades: abortion.We wanted to find out from Irish citizens why they felt the assembly helped to bring about consensus. Here’s what some of them said.Dee, works in education, County Louth Abortion has long been considered politically toxic in Ireland, with our elected representatives loth to touch it in case it alienated their constituents and risked their political careers. The Citizens’ Assembly took the debate out of this realm of fearful self-interested calculation and into a forum where evidence and experience could take centre stage. Interest in the workings of the assembly meant that the media could report on this evidence, leading to a better-informed public and lessening the hysteria that circulates around debates based on dogma. It led to a growing realisation that the 8th amendment affected people in a wide variety of ways even during wanted pregnancies, and revealed the chilling effect it had on medical professionals’ ability to provide necessary healthcare. The members of the assembly were faced with expert testimony on medical and legal matters but also testimony from their fellow citizens whose lives were deeply impacted by the 8th.It meant that there was a long lead-in to the referendum during which debate was reasoned and detailed, before the inevitable agitation of the campaign itself. The fact that it was citizens who recommended the terms of the referendum and informed the proposed legislation introduced greater clarity, and meant voters did not just have to trust politicians since a representative body of their fellow citizens had carefully reflected on the matter and recommended these changes following significant education and deep reflection on the situation. I think the success of the Citizens’ Assembly is evidenced by the fact that the proportion in favour of repeal mirrored so closely the final vote.I was initially very sceptical. The previous discussions on abortion were rife with emotion, and the country was very ided. I was dreading the decisive nature of what I thought was a cop-out. However, I was completely wrong. Issues were discussed logically and with complete transparency and fairness. The result was a revelation in many ways. The extreme for and against arguments were shown to be just that: extreme arguments. The plain, simple facts were what mattered and brought logic to an apparently intractable issue.It is an unbeatable process. I think it would have helped the whole Brexit process had it been followed. However, Ireland had to go through years of hell to finally use it. A shame that our friends and neighbours did not follow it, but then a nation has to have its own learning curve.The Citizens’ Assembly meant the discussion about our abortion laws was led by the people rather than politicians. It’s interesting to see international interest in it, as at the time a lot of people felt it was set up as a way of kicking the can down the road. An awful lot of people against the 8th amendment were calling for the assembly to be scrapped and wanted an immediate referendum. The sentiment was understandable but I personally felt it would have been incredibly irresponsible and undemocratic to hold a referendum on revoking the 8th amendment without having proposed legislation as to what would go in its place. It is absolutely critical that people understand what it is they are voting for.Crucially, a citizens’ assembly is non-partisan and so it creates a people-led discussion and understanding of an issue. I think this also helps create a debate that isn’t dominated by black-and-white mantras from political parties but a more nuanced discussion of the issue in question. Furthermore, politics can feel far removed from the average person and so the discussion and findings can feel far more relatable.There was no trouble accessing the assembly findings as every time they met, the national TV channel, the newspapers and online-only news forums comprehensively reported the assembly’s activities. Unless you chose to stick your head in the clouds, you could not avoid hearing or reading about the assembly. This was not done in an overbearing way, as initially the assembly met once a month, so you were content to tune in to update yourself. I feel this was very important for people who never would have considered voting in favour of abortion. It motivated young people to vote for a subject very important to them, and opened up debate among people in general. The greatest thing the assembly did was get balanced and truthful information out among the people of Ireland.A citizens’ assembly has revealed itself to me to be a vital tool in a democracy – it takes the debating of a contentious issue right back down into the hands of people on the electoral roll. This is great as our politicians are so often tied into a certain viewpoint based on political agenda, party politics or personal gain. I feel a citizens’ assembly would be a very helpful tool in the Brexit dilemma.The assembly facilitated the presentation of a whole range of views and insights on the topic. The media coverage of presentations triggered a lot of discussion. Expert input at the forum informed public opinion and thus facilitated greater understanding of the issues at play in crisis pregnancies. For many, the revelation that abortion pills could be bought on the internet was a game changer. Clearly, women taking such pills without medical supervision are seriously imperilled. The realisation that abortion was already reasonably prevalent in our society led people to see that it is best for society to accept its reality and provide for safe provision under medical care.The Citizens’ Assembly, with due thanks to its chair, provided a forum where the real story was told. The broad spectrum of experience, case histories and moral viewpoints was set out for evaluation and consideration. Misrepresentation was not an option, for proponents or opponents. There was no “bluster bus”. If there is a second Brexit referendum, it should be preceded by a citizens’ assembly, chaired by an experienced judge and supported by an expert team of fact checkers.It felt very democratic. All sides were addressed. It very much helped me – not to decide as I already knew how I was voting, but to listen, understand and develop empathy for those who planned to vote the other way. The issue was a very complex and isive one, and the Citizens’ Assembly helped the issue be seen from all sides. This is not a simple issue of right or wrong. Interpersonal discussions on the issue often became emotional, leading to them becoming deadlocked. The Citizens’ Assembly kept information flowing whether we liked to hear it or not. The fact that it was made up entirely of my peers, and that through the assembly we the voters were exposed to the thoughts and opinions of experts from both sides, very much helped to establish a belief that this was a vote of the people and that we were being given all the information available in order to make up our minds. We weren’t being preached at or lied to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5df1e31a742f2ff4affa3d1d68022bfcc4737924/0_406_2334_1400/master/2334.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99412970024d14295e6785ec1530d3ed","title":"for the eu to prosper britain must leave","story":"The UK’s failure to understand the give and take required means this relationship was always doomedUntil recently I was a committed remainer and wedded to the belief that the best way out of this Brexit mess for the EU was simply to try to ensure it didn’t happen. But the events of the past month illustrate why there is, rightly, a growing mood in Brussels for a completely different outcome: for the EU to prosper, Britain must leave.The rationale is simple, Brexit is – either now or in the not-so-distant future – inevitable. That is because Britain continues to demand impossible conditions for its membership of the community-based, compromise-led, multinational organisation the modern EU represents. Even in trying to exit, Britain is still arguing about “red lines” of its own making. This approach would only amplify if it somehow ended up remaining a member.  Britain already enjoys a privileged position in the EU, much to the chagrin of many other member states. Opt-outs from the euro, the Schengen agreement on passport-free travel, the charter of fundamental rights and on any European legislation related to freedom, justice and security have all been negotiated by successive British prime ministers.European diplomats are exasperated at how this situation is still portrayed in Britain as the creep of an EU super-state. The Luxembourg prime minister, Xavier Bettel, put it best when he said the British “were in with a lot of opt-outs, now they are out and want a lot of opt-ins”. This situation is untenable for the future cohesiveness of the EU it slows decision making, makes the setting of meaningful objectives difficult to achieve and acts as a brake on meaningful reform.From a historical and political economy perspective, Brexit is an inevitability. Since Margaret Thatcher’s famous Bruges speech of 1988, where she set out a vision of a Europe based on “willing cooperation between sovereign states”, Britain and the EU have been like a married couple living increasingly separate lives. And the fault here is shared. Britain – most noticeably under Labour from 1997 to 2010 – lived the myth that the UK could have its EU membership but stand aloof from its development. Brussels refused to acknowledge that all the real love had long since passed.British attitudes towards the Irish border question are a good example of the UK misunderstanding the EU at a most fundamental level. The backstop, which is designed to prevent the reimposition of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, is neither about trapping the UK in a permanent arrangement nor seeking to break it up. The widespread British view of the backstop shows a deep distrust of EU institutions and their role in protecting the interests of member states and maintaining a level playing field.Another example is Britain’s famous “rebate” from its budget contributions to the EU. Were Brexit somehow to be reversed, there would be no support among other member states for these rebates to continue. Although unreported in Britain, the current negotiations in Brussels for the next budgetary period (2021-27) are progressing at pace. The shortfall (€12bn-15bn) caused by Britain’s exit will be met with higher contributions from other member states. Much more money will be allocated to emerging priority areas such as border control, research and development and climate change.Britain never understood that contributing to the EU’s budget is not a commercial transaction, it is about investing in peace, stability and growth right on your doorstep. The fact is, without Britain, the internal functioning of the EU, including agreeing what to spend money on, becomes easier.But here lies the crux of the problem for Britain. The sovereignty-sharing, legalistic model of integration embodied by the EU only succeeds because member states see the bigger, sometimes almost incalculable, benefits of membership. Raging arguments over migration, Russia and populism may be a feature of European council summits in Brussels. The European commission might take Hungary or Poland to task over reforms which threaten democracy. But none of these debates question the wider integrity of the EU project.Britain today – from the gleaming towers of the City of London to the rusting coalfields of the Welsh valleys – is a microcosm of the challenges facing all post-colonial powers. But while France and Germany see European integration as the mechanism to secure peace and maximise their global role, Britain’s failing relationship with the EU shows that it is still searching for the right expression of its place in the world.The future remains to be written, but for Britain and Europe one solution is obvious: a no-blame orce followed by respect and friendship. After all, families are complicated, friends with benefits less so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83f4f05d04e47699104a49cb58021828ccb27772/0_280_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27400fe854052542dafbd3a4b61a2ea2","title":"general election unlikely theresa may brexit","story":"And yet. May’s Brexit deal has suffered the biggest defeat in the history of British democracy. If she halved the margin of defeat in another vote, it would still find a place in the five worst parliamentary routs. How on earth is she supposed to turn a 230-vote deficit into a victory of at least one, in a matter of weeks? She won’t get a meaningful concession on the backstop from the EU: how will she get the DUP, all the hard Brexiteers of the Tory ERG and Tory remainers on side? Jacob Rees-Mogg is showing signs of surrender to May, but a hardcore would not follow him. If she is expecting mass Labour defections to back her deal, disappointment beckons. May is in an impossible situation of her own making.What of the other options? Even if the Labour leadership instructed its MPs to back a second referendum – which would immediately trigger mass resignations from its frontbench – many in leave seats would refuse to do so, as would the vast majority of Tory MPs. The numbers simply aren’t there and indeed as pre-eminent British psephologist John Curtice points out, there is no public clamour for another vote. “No deal” is not going to happen – May would face resignations, even Tory MPs abandoning the whip, if she seriously attempted it – and next week, Yvette Cooper’s amendment to block it is likely to pass.So what’s left? In our tumultuous times, things can change dramatically: perhaps parliamentary arithmetic will swing dramatically behind May, perhaps a surge in support of a second referendum will happen, perhaps a majority of MPs will somehow back a sensible compromise such as Norway plus. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.On Brexit, Labour will face unprecedented strains on its electoral coalition. It needs to avoid disillusionment leading to abstention or substantial defection among passionate remainers but the electoral reality is that most of the Tory-held seats it needs to win voted leave. One possibility is that Labour commits to renegotiate a deal and hold a referendum on its terms, with a free vote offered to Labour ministers and MPs, just as Harold Wilson did in 1975. The other is simply to pledge to renegotiate a softer Brexit. Both have their risks.Labour will have to put pressure on broadcasters not to frame the election as being about Brexit and nothing else. Even May, upon becoming prime minister, accepted that “burning injustices” led to the referendum result. Austerity, the fall in living standards, the housing crisis, struggling public services: all must be central to the debate, not just talk of customs unions and tariff-free access. After all, the next government may last for five years: it would be a travesty not to debate the full gamut of policy.Corbynism’s success depends on being seen as an insurgent movement: Labour should be brave about picking fights with vested interests. Tory threats of Labour “chaos” will look absurd after the post-2015 turmoil, and with May dangling “no deal” as a serious prospect in an election campaign, Labour will have political space to be even bolder than last time. YouGov is alone in showing Labour significantly behind: the party should embrace such polls, casting itself as the underdog.A viral social media campaign – so critical to bypassing a hostile media in 2017 – will be even more sophisticated this time around. On the ground, Momentum is already making plans for what it believes could be the biggest mobilisation of activists in the history of British democracy. Labour’s new community organising unit, led by London Citizens veteran Dan Firth, has given organising training to hundreds of activists in key marginals, built big campaign teams for prospective Labour candidates, and focused on embedding the party in previously neglected communities. An election will put this strategy to its ultimate test.Sure, it may not happen. The fact that a senior Tory figure is leaking the party’s poor electoral prospects may be an attempt to scare backbenchers into voting for May’s deal or it may be a sign that they fear she is going to roll the dice. Civil servants are certainly getting ready for a snap poll. Labour, and more importantly its supporters, must do so too. This could be the historic election that ends a generation of Thatcherite dogma, and builds an entirely new social model based on public ownership, workers’ rights, state investment and progressive taxation. They had better be prepared."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d49484aa9df3182d2f5607897d97dd607db14f7d/0_876_4291_2574/master/4291.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fbc90ea32c3f0836550e6b1070ece58","title":"heresy workspaces churches trendy pod","story":"Walking through Camden Town in north London recently – a place whose countercultural relevance dwindled sometime between the Libertines’ first and second albums – I came across a building labelled WORK.LIFE, plus the slogan, “Because life’s too short”.It seemed to symbolise everything that the late cultural theorist Mark Fisher meant when he coined the phrase “boring dystopia”. WORK.LIFE is one of those hubs for freelancers, or “digital nomads” – a handy phrase if that green juice cleanse isn’t providing the quite the level of purging that your body desires. Don’t flush yet, though, there’s more: “Nestled in one of London’s most iconic postcodes, there’s plenty of creative spirit here as well as a punk-rock approach to business.”“We believe that work doesn’t have to feel like work,” the website smarms on. “In fact, we think you can blend your work with your life to create a lifestyle you love – all the time, not just outside the 9-5.”There will be those of you who, much like myself, see this patter as a prime example of the capitalist colonisation of leisure time. Little by little, and facilitated by technology, the lines between work and play have become blurred. Social media encourages users to promote themselves as though they are products. So why not live, work and socialise in the same space too? Many of us are disturbed by these developments. Other ways of living, where the terms “work” and “life” are separated by canyons of empty white space, have much more appeal.But we social revolutionaries are old hat. These hubs for digital nomads are popping up everywhere in our cities, and now the Church of England wants some of the action. The Times reports that it is to offer desks to young professionals, not to mention on-site gyms, as part of a £35m drive to attract younger congregation members. Focusing on areas with large student populations, these churches will offer a range of trendy services, with Stockton-on-Tees even appointing a “social media pastor”.I should probably say here that I am not religious, and tend to view the attempt to modernise on the part of most religions as fatally incompatible with the whole worshipping-a-fictitious sky-god-who-tells-us-women-and-gay-people-are-inferior thing. Introduce a guitar into the proceedings, and I’m the first one calling for the last judgment. I don’t care if the whole world turns into a Hieronymus Bosch painting, I’ll even lead the procession into the demon’s cavernous, gaping mouth provided I don’t have to listen to Christian rock. And that’s before we get to the archbishop of Canterbury’s “speaking in tongues” revelation.Then again, I grew up having my tarot cards read, several people in my family are Buddhist, and I’m pretty sure I once saw a ghost, so each to their own. Leaving theology aside for a moment (cracked that one, lads), it’s the religious co-opting of the capitalist work ethic that gives me pause. With Protestantism, you could argue that the two things are natural bedfellows. And yet, before we had community hubs we had … churches. The original hubs. Fuse the two, and to where departeth the soul?Churches are supposed to be places of refuge for the poor and dispossessed, not workspaces for every AirPod-wearing, kombucha-drinking, laptop-tapping, hashtagging social media manager trying to make it as an influencer on the side. These people don’t need help, but those struggling under austerity desperately do. The commitment that those in the church have shown towards highlighting the evils of that economic policy has made me feel more favourable towards the institution than free wifi ever could. The church’s night shelters and soup kitchens, its mother and baby groups and food banks – these are the community services that bring people together.Workspaces where people sit on their laptops, atomised and alienated from one another are 10 a penny. Why offer more of the same? Shouldn’t religious buildings be places of refuge from the treadmill? Will those kinds of people really see such a backdrop as part of their “personal brand”? Besides, ecclesiastical buildings will require the kind of fan heater that dwarfs the one currently at my feet.Perhaps I am idealising the role of the church because I have had little contact with it. Yet aspects of it have personal resonance. My grandmother was born into a Salvation Army home, and until his death my grandfather made regular donations, which I have tried to continue. And on a recent visit to Chester Cathedral last month, I found myself unexpectedly moved. They were holding a Christmas tree festival. As we walked through the nave admiring the clerestory windows and the corbels and whatnot (who doesn’t love a bit of perpendicular Gothic?), a choir were practising for an imminent wedding, and the clear, bright soprano notes were floating up into air. I stopped to examine a tree festooned with paper stars. On each star, a message to someone whom the writer had lost. “Missing you, Mum, particularly at Christmas.” I had to walk away.Thankfully, the moment was swiftly undermined by another tree, decorated to promote a local accountancy firm, with envelopes proclaiming “Santa’s tax return”. I may have hooted, my tears vanishing, but I know which tree I preferred. Leave the work stuff to the minimalist nomad hubs. Concentrate on the stuff of life (and death).

Mistry believes that postgraduate researchers need to be able to share experiences and support each other to stay healthy. “Isolation is one of the main issues that affect students’ mental wellbeing,” she says. “Developing a community with good support mechanisms and access to mental health practitioners is key.”Undergraduates’ wellbeing has grabbed headlines, but the experiences of postgraduates – researchers in particular – are not so often considered. Some feel isolated, according to research published this year by Vitae and the Institute for Employment Studies (IES).“They might suffer anxiety about whether they deserve their place at university,” says Sally Wilson, who led IES’s contribution to the research. “Postgraduates can feel as though they are in a vacuum. They don’t know how to structure their time. Many felt they didn’t get support from their supervisor.”Taught students tend to fare better than researchers – they enjoy more structure and contact, says Sian Duffin, student support manager at Arden University. But she believes anxiety is on the rise. “The pressure to gain distinction grades is immense,” she says. “Fear of failure can lead to perfectionism, anxiety and depression.”Younger postgraduates who’ve come straight from undergraduate study might suffer from burnout, particularly if they performed well in their first degree. “Expectations can feel impossible to sustain. The feeling of ‘not good enough’ can erode confidence and self-esteem.”With more postgraduates forced to live at home, universities are losing what psychologist and author Audrey Tang calls “that campus feel”. Staff at Brunel University, where she runs mindfulness sessions for postgraduates, try to intercept students before they hit crisis point and require help from counsellors – whose services are nearly always overbooked at many institutions.Since the summer, 17 universities have won up to £150,000 each (totalling £1.5m) from the Office for Students to target postgraduate wellbeing. Some, such as the University of Manchester and University of Sussex, are linking with NHS services and training both staff and students. Leeds Beckett and Portsmouth are investing in initiatives to change attitudes and awareness of mental health. Derby and the University of the West of England are developing web-based resources and apps to help students connect with each other and help intervene early. “These are early projects,” says Wilson. “They’re trying to understand exactly what is needed – it’s not one size fits all.”If students do slip through the net, it’s important emergency provision doesn’t depend on a single staff member, says Clare Dickens, mental health and wellbeing coordinator at the University of Wolverhampton, where the award-winning “three minutes to save a life” suicide prevention scheme is being rolled out.Nearly 450 student union officers and staff – from caretakers to academic staff and the vice-chancellor – have been trained in how to recognise and act on early warning signs. “It’s not helpful just to tell students to go and seek help,” says Dickens. “If someone is in obvious emotional pain, then literally a few minutes of your time could save them. You haven’t got to sit there for three hours – that’s not your job. But we must respond with compassion.”As a postgraduate, you will have many demands on your time. But if you don’t stay healthy, or work too long on autopilot, you might lose attention to detail, miss opportunities and burn out personally and professionally. If the world around you is not going to slow down, says psychologist Dr Audrey Tang, who wrote The Leader’s Guide to Mindfulness, you’ll need to find a way to manage.Looking after yourself, she says, is not unnecessary or indulgent: if you’re physically, emotionally and mentally healthy, you’ll perform better for yourself and others.Set “office hours” and don’t engage in work-related matters after a certain time (as much as teaching requirements allow).Fresh air and time away from your work always does you good. A daily walk – maybe with a friend or family – will re-energise you.Yoga, tai chi and other relaxation therapies can clear the mind. Just 30 minutes exercise three times a week has been proved to lift mood.Make sure you take a proper lunch break – that means physically stepping away from where you’re working.Break down tasks – completing achievable goals will give you a sense of satisfaction. Identify mood patterns and try to plan your day to suit these.Go to social and wellbeing events on offer. “Attend any extra seminars, lectures and events in your field – you can build common ground. It’s a boost for academic and pastoral wellbeing,” says former postgraduate Philippa Bunch.Don’t be afraid to reach out and ask for help, companionship or just a chat.If you feel lonely or anxious in new social situations, take it slowly – or try a class where you can immerse yourself in the activity, rather than focus on needing to speak to people straight away.In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org.

It is predicted to achieve just a third of the 800m hoped-for extra cycling trips by 2025, with much of that predicted growth restricted to London.Rachel White of Sustrans said that when it came to active travel, “we’re doing something wrong”, while Joe Irving of Living Streets called the government’s walking targets “unambitious, conservative and cautious”, citing its ambition that people should conduct one stage of a journey on foot 300 times a year, or less than once a day. This could include walking 10 seconds to a bus stop.Roger Geffen of Cycling UK said: “It’s not about putting bike lanes in where there’s a bit of spare money and a bit of spare space – there needs to be a dense network of routes.”Geffen said that because active travel was funded from various pots, “we don’t know how much money is being spent on cycling, and we don’t know how well it’s being spent”.We know cycling is an efficient, healthy and cheap means of transport, while lessons from countries such as Denmark on the benefits of decent funding and long-term planning of dense cycle networks are readily available. We know dangerous driving and air pollution from cars kill tens of thousands a year. We know developers fail on pledges to deliver cycling, walking and public transport promises, leaving communities over-reliant on cars.We have a cycling minister in Jesse Norman who “gets” active travel and has helped drive a Highway Code review and funding for police operations and driver training, among other things.The CWIS has moved us forward a little, for the first time requiring government to set aside funding for cycling and answer to parliament on its policies, but it is a first step.As the transport committee chair, Lilian Greenwood, said, although cycling’s benefits include improving congestion, air quality, carbon emissions and physical and mental health, when it comes to government policy “clearly there’s a concern there isn’t sufficient ambition and funding and certainly that funding isn’t guaranteed for a long enough period”. She added: “It’s moving in the right direction but there’s quite a long way to go.”The government’s local cycling and walking investment plans would be a good place to start local authorities have been encouraged to draw up long-term active travel infrastructure plans but there is no money to implement them. “There is a real risk these become documents that sit on a shelf gathering dust,” said White.“We know the importance of political leadership,” Greenwood said.She said “great cycling cities” such as Amsterdam and Copenhagen “haven’t always been that way. They took a decision they wanted their city to be different and they acted on it.” As has Manchester, where big cycling and walking plans are afoot under its cycling and walking commissioner, Chris Boardman.Meanwhile, parliamentarians could look outside their windows and witness first-hand the simple brilliance of the humble cycle and the difference good infrastructure can make. The evidence is clear – now they just have to fund it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71f117c7034e051ef4b7e91775b4ce9b8c4aeca0/0_2748_3024_1815/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a8e58ef4ee02c51718276c792121d9","title":"how to survive this bleakest of winters stomp about in chunky boots","story":"There’s nothing like a big pair of boots to make you raise your fist to the sky and say: screw you, world. And what do you know, they’re back in fashionUgh January. How am I supposed to get through this hellish month? Tanya, by emailTwo words, Tanya: chunky boots. If the 1990s was the decade that the phrase “fuck-me shoes” was coined, we are now very much in the era of “fuck-you boots”, the bigger and stompier the better. Because, let’s be honest, that is pretty much the mood we are all in these days, and all this energy has to go somewhere, and surely it is better siphoning it down to your feet than spewing it all over social media. After all, what would make you feel better in the morning – waking up exhausted because you stayed up until 2am fighting about Trump with a stranger on Facebook, or waking up happily refreshed, slipping on a pair of chunky ankle boots and stomping out the door?I have loved chunky boots since I was 14 and bought my first pair of DMs from Shellys on Kensington High Street. Not a confident teenager by nature, I realised my boots gave me that confidence you can’t walk in DM’s apologetically – you can only march defiantly, and it felt freaking great. As soon as I had paid for them, I marched straight across the road to the much-missed Kensington Market, a place I had always feared as being way too cool for me, largely because it wasn’t Kookai. I headed straight to the body-piercing booth and demanded that the punk who worked there pierce my ears. Five times: three in one ear, two in the other. And for added measure, I got my belly button done, too. OK, so it turned out the punk wasn’t that great at piercing, and to this day I have a weird grey lump in my earlobe caused by a bit of nickel that broke off from the back of an earring, mid-pierce, and I nearly passed out in pain when he drove a literal wooden stake through my tummy to pierce it. But still, as I left Ken Market that day, my ears nearly bleeding off my head, barely able to see straight because of the pain, but my feet still stomping, I had never felt so cool in my life. And the truth is, I was never that cool again.So I was delighted when my esteemed colleague Scarlett Conlon wrote on these pages at the end of last year that chunky boots are back this season, because it meant the stores would be full of chunky boots, and I would have more chance of finding my perfect pair. And over Christmas, find them I did. Part-ski boot, part-hiking boot, they are so chunky and stompy I gain at least three jolts of testosterone every time I put them on, and I love it. I wear them with shorts and tights, with miniskirts, with party dresses. I would wear them to bed but I would probably end up accidentally assaulting myself. They are the kind of boots that make you want to put on your headphones, turn up World Destruction by Time Zone and raise your fist to the sky. And really, that is all I have ever wanted from a pair of shoes.Part of being a grownup means accepting other people think differently from you, and I have slowly learned to recognise that not everyone feels the same way as me – about everything, but also about shoes, and that women who claim to love high heels (the polar opposite to stompy boots) aren’t just lying to make themselves sound glamorous. They really mean it. In this month’s Vogue, fashion editor Sophia Neophitou describes in genuinely fascinating detail her lifelong obsession with high heels, and how they made her feel “empowered”, even though “in a heel, you are always looking for danger areas – cobbles, paving stone cracks, grates – and conscious of where you are planting each foot”. Now, I try to be understanding, but, seriously, who has the time for this any more? Not even Sophia, who has had to switch to flats after an accident, and has discovered: “Now, I’m able to get up and out.”Damn right, and with stompy boots you get up and out even more quickly and with more energy. That is why I genuinely believe shoes are a feminist issue – women need shoes that give them energy and leave their minds free to dismantle the patriarchy, not worry about cobblestones. It is a dark and cold world out there at the moment, people, but don’t fear it: stomp on it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud.

How very wrong. At the age of 88 – and in a not dissimilar role – he is back with formidable chutzpah, directing himself, with the crinkly-eyed grimace even more emphatically weaponised.It’s a watchable movie, loosely based on a true story there’s a nice storytelling swing to it and Eastwood is frankly far more interesting than Robert Redford was in his recent swansong. Not that this is necessarily Clint’s own acting swansong, not by any means. In old age, he has incidentally developed a walk as distinctive as John Wayne’s. His bare forearms in a short-sleeved shirt are now disconcertingly long, and have a kind of slow menacing waggle, moving in tandem with his legs as he lopes to and from the car.Eastwood plays Earl Stone, a cantankerous old geezer and prizewinning horticulturalist who has neglected his family all his life. When competition from the internet undermines his flower trade, Earl desperately needs cash and by accident falls into the highly lucrative business of running cocaine for the Mexican cartels. An old white guy in his rickety old pickup is never suspected by the cops – who are on permanent red alert for Latino-looking males. There’s an interesting scene when a panicky and entirely innocent man in this category is pulled over the police and he stammeringly tells them that this is the most dangerous five minutes of his life.Clint’s Earl is in many ways quite outrageous and it is difficult to tell how deliberate this is. He is a genial, adorable racist and sexist who tells a black family they are “negroes” and smilingly submits to their polite correction. Yet more jaw-dropping is the fact that Eastwood awards himself two scenes in which his character gets it on with two prostitutes at once. We cut away from the gruesome action reasonably tactfully, but in each case the aftermath scene makes it clear that things have gone perfectly satisfactorily.Elsewhere, Laurence Fishburne, Bradley Cooper and Michael Peña play cops whose characters and scenes are pretty perfunctorily written. It’s a sentimental tale of hokum, carried by Eastwood’s star quality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eb2c16460dd4ad04fecdf77405eeba4c2041ca2/0_197_5912_3547/master/5912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42ac74b9a998746909f2f2ccb555d7f3","title":"emiliano sala search resumes for lost plane carrying cardiff player","story":"Operation fails to spot any sign of plane as pilot reported to be experienced flyer named Dave IbbotsonPolice searching for the footballer Emiliano Sala will consider calling off the operation later on Wednesday having failed to find any sign of the aircraft he was travelling in after scouring 280 sq miles of the Channel.In a lunchtime update, Guernsey police said “multiple aircraft” had been involved in the search operation over five hours on Wednesday but “no trace” of the missing light aircraft had been found.They added: “A decision whether to continue will be taken later today.”Earlier, rescuers said they were basing the operation on the premise that Sala made it into a life raft after the plane he was in disappeared over the sea.The pilot of the plane is reported to be Dave Ibbotson, an experienced flyer and member of the British Parachute Association, from the small Lincolnshire town of Crowle, near Scunthorpe.Debra Middleton, the mayor of Crowle and Ealand, said Ibbotson was “very well known and very well liked” and that residents were hoping desperately for a positive outcome. Councillors were told about the plane going missing at a meeting on Tuesday night, she said.“I don’t know him personally but I know of him and everybody speaks very highly of him,” Middleton told the . “A lot of people know him. He’s a local in the village, he’s been here a long time, and he’s very well known and very well liked throughout the community. We all really do feel for his family. Everybody’s listening to the news and hoping everything’s OK.”Sala’s travel arrangements are understood to have been organised by the football agent Willie MacKay, who was reportedly involved in the Argentinian footballer’s transfer from the French side Nantes to Cardiff City. Asked to confirm whether he was involved arranging in Sala’s travel, MacKay told the  he could not discuss the matter.L’Équipe reported that the head of the rescue operation said if Sala and the pilot had landed on water and made it on to a life raft, there was still a chance they could be alive. “Nobody here, including me, is giving up. We are determined to find the two men alive,” the newspaper quoted Capt David Barker as saying.Guernsey police said they were working on four possibilities:The police added: “Our search area is prioritised on the life raft option. More updates as information becomes available.”A spokesperson for the force said: “There are currently three planes and one helicopter in the air. We are also reviewing satellite imagery and mobile phone data to see if they can be of any assistance in the search. So far today nothing spotted can be attributed to the missing plane.”The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch said the plane was unlikely to have been fitted with a flight recorder, or black box. A vital tool for crash investigators, they are mandatory on airliners and business jets, but not on light aircraft such as the Piper PA-46 Malibu that Sala was travelling in. It is a legal requirement for European aircraft to carry an emergency transmitter to aid search and rescue operations.The AAIB said it was working closely with authorities in the US, France and Argentina. A spokesman said: “We will be gathering all the available evidence to conduct a thorough investigation. However, if the aircraft is not found it is likely to limit the scope of the investigation.”The remarks came as Sala’s former girlfriend Berenice Schkair, 27, made an emotional appeal on social media, writing: “I want to wake up and all of this to be a lie. Please investigate because I cannot believe this accident. Don’t suspend the search for bad weather when you only just found objects floating. I need to read that you have shown up.”She added: “Emi, my heart is broken. I still cannot understand it. I’m destroyed, I feel pain, fear, anger and impotence for not being able to do anything. I know you’re strong. We are waiting for you.”In a separate post, Buenos Aires-born Schkair wrote: “Investigate the football mafia because I don’t believe this was an accident.”When asked by the Argentinian media outlet Infobae for a comment, she said: “The only thing I want is for him to show up. Out of respect for the family I prefer to wait, I’m going to say what I need to say in a few days.” The aircraft, carrying Sala and the pilot, disappeared off Alderney on Monday night. The 28-year-old footballer reportedly sent a voicemail message to his father saying he was frightened the plane was about to break up.He was flying to Wales from Nantes after signing for Cardiff City for a club record fee of £13m.In a transcript of the call, quoted by the Mirror, he said: “I’m here on a plane that looks like it’s about to fall apart, and I’m going to Cardiff … If in an hour and a half you have no news from me, I don’t know if they are going to send someone to look for me because they cannot find me, but you know … Dad, how scared am I!”The search and rescue operation, which included help from the Channel Islands, UK and France, was suspended for the day at 5pm on Tuesday.According to Guernsey police, the Piper PA-46 took off at 7.15pm on Monday and was flying at an altitude of 5,000ft (1,500 metres). On passing Guernsey it “requested descent”, but Jersey air traffic control lost contact with it while it was flying at 2,300ft.After a 15-hour search from rescue teams, which covered an area of 1,155 sq miles (2,990 sq km), police said “a number of floating objects” had been seen in the water, but they were unable to confirm whether any were from the missing aircraft.Earlier on Tuesday, Cardiff City’s executive director, Ken Choo, expressed his shock and distress at the news. Choo described Sala as a “great person” and said he had been “so happy” to sign for Cardiff.The club chairman, Mehmet Dalman, told BBC Radio Wales: “We spoke to the player and asked him if he wanted us to make arrangements for his flight, which would have been commercial. He declined and made his own arrangements. I can’t tell you who arranged the flight because I don’t know at this stage, but it certainly wasn’t Cardiff City.”Investigators say the pilot had checked in with air traffic control in Nantes and Brest, then was transferred to London. He had requested to descend to 5,000ft. Last readings show the plane was flying at 2,300 feet, it was reported.Dalman said the club’s manager, Neil Warnock, was “in a state of shock”. He said: “Neil is human and he’s affected as much as we all are. We need to get on and do the right things but at the moment there’s a vacuum of information – it’s very unsettling.”Dalman said the reaction from the football world and beyond had been overwhelming, adding: “I even had a text message from a prime minister to wish us well.”He added: “Cardiff City will be involved with the investigation. We won’t leave a single stone unturned until we have all the facts … It’s a tragedy that I have never faced before. It has affected the club enormously. Our hearts go out to his family, especially those very far away. It’s a distressing time. We feel very saddened by it.” Hundreds of fans, many in tears, gathered in Nantes city centre on Tuesday evening for an emotional tribute to the missing player. Many laid bouquets of yellow flowers – Nantes are known as the Canaries because of their bright yellow kit – and chanted Sala’s name.Nantes FC said in a statement the tribute was “a spontaneous initiative by fans … The club thanks its supporters and the entire football family for the numerous expressions of support.” The message concluded: “#PrayForSala.”The Fulham manager, Claudio Ranieri, who was at Nantes last season, said he was “devastated”. “Emiliano was a marvellous person, a fighter. The football world is united in hoping for positive news. I pray for Emiliano and his family,” he tweeted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a125b6c2aae5838f307b88a18ae705ed8e151730/305_0_3977_2386/master/3977.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db8c0d6059a27a2edeaf5ae111d24e27","title":"frenkie de jong barcelona transfer news ajax","story":"Ajax midfielder Frenkie de Jong will join Barcelona this summer on a five-year contract for €75m (£65.3m), the La Liga club have announced.“FC Barcelona and Ajax have reached an agreement for the transfer of midfielder Frenkie de Jong, who will be joining the Catalan club from 1 July 2019,” a statement on the club’s website read.“The cost of the transfer operation is €75m, plus a further €11m in variables.

Higuaín’s arrival on loan from Juventus, a deal which should be announced on Wednesday afternoon after he flew to London to sign, may help but the player failed to complete the paperwork by the midday deadline to feature against Spurs.Yet, with the situation at Chelsea clearly on edge after a fourth defeat in 11 Premier League matches, Sarri’s decision to question Hazard’s leadership qualities felt untimely. The uncertainty over the 28-year-old’s contractual situation has been a recurring theme to date this season, with Real Madrid’s interest omnipresent. But, even when thrust into an uncomfortable No 9 role, he has contributed significantly in terms of goals and assists under the Italian’s stewardship.Sarri had referenced Cesar Azpilicueta, who currently wears the armband in the absence of the out of favour Gary Cahill, and David Luiz as “players with the characteristics to be leaders‚“ who could “help all the other players to get the right mentality”. Asked whether Hazard, who has captained Belgium 28 times and led them to third in last summer’s World Cup, also boasts such qualities, he said: “I don’t know in this moment ... in this moment, he’s more an inidual player than a leader. He is very important for us, of course, because he is a great player. He always can win the match in two minutes. Sometimes in one minute. But, at the moment, he’s not a leader. He’s a great player. One of the best in the world.“I think he said that coaches told him that he needs to do more. I think he has to do more. Because the potential is higher than the performances. He has to respect first of all himself. He has to do more. You know very well that Eden, at the moment, is a wonderful player. But he’s an inidual player. He’s an instinctive player. For him, it’s very difficult to play only in one position. He likes very much to go to the ball, in the direction of the ball. He wants the ball at his feet. So it’s very difficult for him to play as a striker, but also as a winger. We have to organise the other 10 players in the defensive phase because he needs to play everywhere on the pitch.”Hazard had given an interview to France Football in midweek in which he admitted to having frustrated all the coaches with whom he has worked. Asked if Sarri counted himself in their number, the Italian added with a chuckle: “Sometimes. I prefer him when he speaks with his feet.”Higuaín should be in attendance at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea attempt to overturn a 1-0 deficit from the first leg, and could make his debut in Sunday’s FA Cup fourth round tie against Sheffield Wednesday.“We need to react on the pitch. The rest is nothing. We discussed with the players how to try to improve the approach, the motivation, the determination. And so we are trying to change something in training, in pre-match, in everything. But I think we all have to react on the pitch. We needed to discuss our problems. The first step, if I want to improve, is to accept the mistakes. Otherwise it’s impossible to improve. It was a normal discussion for improving.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a46c005e15ef22bd23f8dc2278056d310ceb053/0_263_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2b2303856cda19295a99d9c1f7cb35f","title":"the fiver tin pot burton manchester city","story":"Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!It’s one of the banner occasions in the football calendar: the semi-finals of England’s secondary knockout competition, Tin Pot! There have been some memorable ties down the years. The Fiver recalls Chelsea beating Wycombe Wanderers 4-0. One time, West Brom saw off Carlisle 4-1. And there was that season Manchester City battered West Ham 9-0 on aggregate. But anyway, those memorable ties we were talking about. Well, we vaguely remember fourth-tier Bradford City humiliating five-time winners Aston Villa. The Arsenal-Tottenham stramash in 1987 was fairly epic. And … erm … actually, sod it, that’ll do. QED!Sadly, looking at the state of this year’s second legs, it doesn’t look as though either of the ties will end up in the pantheon alongside Bradford-Villa, Arsenal-Spurs and that time treble-chasing Liverpool scored 78 own goals against QPR. You see, Thursday night’s match is to be contested between a knackered Tottenham squad stretched beyond breaking point and with hamstrings to match, and a bunch of lads from Chelsea who even their own manager freely admits can’t be bothered. We’ll be looking forward to that one, then (and you can thank us for tempting fate when it ends 6-6). As for Wednesday’s return between Burton Albion and Manchester City, well for goodness’ sake.Burton are, of course, a mere nine goals adrift after the first leg at the Etihad degenerated into dismal farce. It’s not going too far out on a limb to say the Brewers aren’t going to turn this one around. Yet if ancient history is any guide, it could be closer than some people think. On Boxing Day 1894, City travelled to Burton Wanderers in the old Second Division and went down 8-0, still a club-record defeat. Three months later, City beat Lincoln 11-3, setting their league record for most goals scored and developing a habit for glorious unpredictability from the get-go.Anyway, Burton Wanderers merged with Burton Swifts to become Burton United, Burton United merged with Burton All Saints to become Burton Town, and Burton Town were folded into a new entity called Burton Albion after the war. And here we are now! Hey, so you don’t think the modern Burton could draw on the precedent set by their illustrious predecessors and make this a contest, do you? No, of course you don’t.Join Scott Murray for room-temperature Carling Cup action in Burton 1-3 Manchester City (1-12 agg).David Squires drills down into Unai Emery and Mesut Özil’s relationship, with predictably enjoyable results.“Re: Tuesday’s Quote of the Day.

I would trundle along with my parents to our local Presbyterian church near Leeds. The minister always wore a large black flowing gown and spoke to us all from ‘on high’ in his pulpit. I genuinely thought he was this God fellow I had heard so much about. Anyway, one morning after church, we attended a coffee morning held in the neighbouring church hall. The minister moved through the gathered flock shaking hands and chatting amiably. Being about three feet tall, I cried out to my father: ‘Lift me up! I want to see God!’ Sweet smiles all around.

What’s behind the obsessive pursuit of a flawless look?People used to call Anika the Snap Queen. Between the ages of 19 and 21, she was “obsessed with Snapchat, to the point where I had 4,000 followers”. At the peak of her “tragic” behaviour, she reckons now – a year after quitting the image-sharing app – she was taking 25 selfies a day.She liked the sense of having a platform, she says, with the average selfie getting 300 replies. “It was like, ‘Oh my God, I’m so popular – I’ve gotta show my face.’” But the filters were also part of the appeal. The Londoner had long been insecure about the slight bump in her nose. Snapchat’s fun effects, which let you embellish your selfies with dog ears, flower crowns and the like, would also erase the bump entirely. “I’d think, ‘I’d like to look how I look with this filter that makes my nose look slimmer.’”Socialising in the real world, she would choose her seat to avoid being seen in profile. She recognises that this was irrational – “but it happens. I feel like we’re in a world where a lot of people are seen to be perfect, and so we try and reach that peak.”Sometimes her followers would suggest meeting in person. “Then it would be like, ‘I have to look like my selfie.’” It was around this time, the height of her Snapchat obsession, that Anika started contacting cosmetic doctors on Instagram.The phenomenon of people requesting procedures to resemble their digital image has been referred to – sometimes flippantly, sometimes as a harbinger of end times – as “Snapchat dysmorphia”. The term was coined by the cosmetic doctor Tijion Esho, founder of the Esho clinics in London and Newcastle. He had noticed that where patients had once brought in pictures of celebrities with their ideal nose or jaw, they were now pointing to photos of themselves.While some used their selfies – typically edited with Snapchat or the airbrushing app Facetune – as a guide, others would say, “‘I want to actually look like this’, with the large eyes and the pixel-perfect skin,” says Esho. “And that’s an unrealistic, unattainable thing.”A recent report in the US medical journal JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery suggested that filtered images’ “blurring the line of reality and fantasy” could be triggering body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), a mental health condition where people become fixated on imagined defects in their appearance. Like Esho, Dr Wassim Taktouk uses non-surgical, non-permanent “injectables” such as Botox and dermal fillers to enlarge lips or smooth a bumpy nose. He recalls a client coming to see him in his cream-carpeted Kensington clinic, upset after a date made through an app had gone south. “When she’d met the man, he had been quite disparaging: ‘You don’t look anything like your picture.’”The woman showed Taktouk the heavily filtered image on her profile and said: “I want to look like that.” It was flawless, he says – “without a single marking of a normal human face”. He told her he couldn’t help. “If that’s the picture you’re going to put out of yourself, you’re setting yourself up for disappointment.”Why do we take so many photos of ourselves? A 2017 study into “selfitis”, as the obsessive taking of selfies has been called, found a range of motivations, from seeking social status to shaking off depressive thoughts and – of course – capturing a memorable moment. Another study suggested that selfies served “a private and internal purpose”, with the majority never shared with anyone or posted anywhere – terabytes, even petabytes of photographs never to be seen by anyone other than their subject.With so much of life now lived online, from dating to job-hunting, recent, quality images of yourself are also a necessity – it is no wonder that Facetune (Apple’s most popular paid-for app of 2017) and the free follow-up Facetune2 have more than 55m users between them. Stav Tishler of Lightricks, the company behind them, says making airbrushing accessible has challenged “that illusion that ‘a perfect body’ exists … and levelled out the playing field”: “Everyone knows everyone is using it, supermodels and ‘everyday’ people alike.”Even novelty filters such as Snapchat and Instagram’s, as well as adding bunny ears or specs to your selfie, plump your lips, erase your pores and lift your jowls while they are at it. (Snapchat declined to respond on the record.)The filtered-selfie look is also reflected in demand for bigger lips and taut jawlines. Such so-called “tweakments” have exploded in recent years, thanks to their relative affordability and convenience. A “liquid nose job” using fillers might cost a few hundred pounds and takes instant effect, compared with the slow, painful recovery from a surgical rhinoplasty. Marla, 29, from New York, got her “perfect nose” last year while on her lunch break. “I went back to work feeling just so much more polished and confident – like I was even writing my emails better.”Like Anika, she had always been bothered by the bump in her nose, religiously removing it from selfies but she began exploring real-world options after a painful breakup. A list of pros and cons revealed that the potential risks – of her parents’ disapproval and “necrosis of the face” (“It’s very rare, but it’s definitely a thing”) – did not outweigh the benefits of having “the nose I create for myself on Facetune”.The rise of fillers – anything from collagen and hyaluronic acid, which break down in a matter of months, to the permanent but riskier polymethyl methacrylate beads – has been accelerated by celebrity endorsements from the likes of the Kardashian clan. The removal and subsequent return of Kylie Jenner’s lip fillers have been followed with particular interest. ) Some doctors try to capitalise on this with “the Kylie package” for nose, jaw and lips, says Taktouk, disapprovingly. Ten years ago, his clients were deeply concerned with patient confidentiality “Now, it’s ‘Do you mind if I Insta-story this?’ It’s not taboo any more.” He has seen lips advertised for £150 and noses for £200-£300. “And that’s one of the trickiest procedures of the lot.”Fillers may be less invasive than surgery, but they are not without their risks, which range from uneven results and infection to vascular blockages and even blindness. Save Face, the UK’s largest register of accredited practitioners of non-surgical treatments, says almost 1,000 complaints were made in the year to October. Yet there is little regulation and no minimum age. “We have more protections for houses than we do children’s faces,” says Esho, who has campaigned for crackdowns. “It’s crazy.”Even Marla – who documented her follow-up nose job in a short film for Vice, and does paid promotional work for cosmetic surgeons – says she would not encourage a young girl to do as she did. “I know that I love myself – that’s why I let myself get little tweaks – but it would really bother me if a young girl told me that she didn’t.”The process is as easy as “click-click-click, look at 10 bits of his work in the space of a minute, wow, let’s contact him”, says Anika. At the age of 20, she turned up at Taktouk’s clinic with photos of noses he had done and a video of herself with a Snapchat filter. “You know the one that kind of makes your face look like an alien’s? I was like, ‘This looks great – my nose looks so much smaller.’ Dr Taktouk was like: ‘This is not what is going to happen with filler.’” She laughs. “He told me to come back with my mum.”Instead, Anika took a year out to consider her decision, weighing up fillers’ merits against surgical rhinoplasty. “Actually, I went through a phase of thinking, ‘No, I should try and love myself.’” How did that go? “I didn’t do rhinoplasty,” she says drily. “I guess that’s as far as I got.” By the time she returned to Taktouk’s clinic, aged 21, she had been brought “back down to earth”. He injected filler into the tip of her nose, evening out its line. She loved it instantly. “I feel like I just needed that to change me inside, so I could stop looking for perfection.”When the filler eventually breaks down after about a year, she will repeat the procedure. “The most beautiful thing is when someone is happy from within,” she says “as ironic as it sounds”, her new nose helped her to attain it. “I’m not itching to get anything else.”There was a moment just after the procedure, though, as she was admiring her new profile, when she wondered aloud if her lips needed filling, too. They were one of her most prominent features she had been called Fish Lips at school. Taktouk told her to stop being silly. “When you’re in that seat, it’s quite tempting,” she says. “Like, ‘What else can I do?’”It prompts the question: which are you trying to correct, the image or the reality?Anna, 40, from Malvern – another patient of Taktouk’s – admits to having once been “fixated” on her laugh lines. “The photos exacerbate it, making it look worse, then a filter can make it look amazing. You’re unsure of what you look like.”Ever since she was young, she has struggled with the discrepancy between how she sees herself in the mirror, and how others see her. Once, she downloaded an app that claimed “to show you how you really look”. “It used to horrify me, and make me feel terrible about myself. But these are conversations you can’t really have, because you do sound self-absorbed and you’re leaving yourself vulnerable.”She is more self-confident now, which she attributes both to age and the occasional self-esteem boost of Botox or filler. “I’m quite realistic now, whereas in the past I’ve driven myself crazy.”For Taktouk, referrals from social media make it harder to safeguard patients’ mental health. His background as a GP has helped him to spot red flags, such as badmouthing other doctors, insisting on flaws that aren’t there, and in-depth knowledge of treatments: “I’ve had someone come in here and draw the lines on their face themselves.” But, he adds, “I’m sure some will have slipped past without me realising” – and even if Taktouk refuses to treat them, someone else will.Over the weekend it was reported that Superdrug (which began offering Botox late last year) has agreed to introduce mental health screening for people seeking Botox, following criticism from the NHS for not conducting “medically responsible” checks. Taktouk says far more industry-wide regulation is needed, before there is a headline-grabbing tragedy and apps become even more transformative. He points to one called Retouch Me, which superimposes six-packs on to swimsuit pictures. “I saw it and thought, this is the new wave of what we’re going to get in: ‘Make me look like this.’”The onset tends to occur in adolescence, though people with the condition may not seek help until 10 years later. The general rule, says Professor David Veale, a consultant psychiatrist at the Maudsley hospital in south London, is that you can “think about your appearance for an hour a day before it becomes a disorder” – but for a diagnosis, it must be accompanied by significant distress or inability to function normally. People with BDD take selfies because they are convinced “that they are hideous”.In 2014, then 19-year-old Danny Bowman from Northumberland was reported to be “Britain’s first selfie addict” after being interviewed about his experience of BDD. His problems had begun four years before, when he was rejected by a modelling agency at the same time as he was being bullied at his new school and on Facebook. “For me, it was confirmation that I did look ugly.”Bowman was soon spending hours before the mirror, slathering himself in acne cream and moisturiser and monitoring a steady stream of selfies for real-time improvement. After three months he dropped out of school, and the selfie-taking increased to hundreds a day. “I was trying to see some gradual improvement, and take that photo that I was pleased with. I was just trying to get that relief, and I couldn’t get it. There wasn’t a perfect photo. There isn’t a perfect photo.”After six months of being housebound, consumed by his daily rituals, he tried to kill himself. “A lot of people say looking at themselves in the mirror probably makes them feel insecure, but imagine scanning through 200 pictures a day. I was just exhausted. I felt like there was no way out.” His mother – like his father, a mental health professional – found him in time and he was diagnosed with BDD. Part of his 12-week treatment involved restricting access to his phone.Now 24, Bowman is studying at the University of York and campaigns on issues related to mental health and positive body image. He has raised concerns about the impact of Instagram with friends he sees “posting photographs of themselves every other day, Facetuning themselves, making themselves look unlike the way they look. That was me, but on an amplified scale.” They have reacted defensively, he says. “It has become such a normal thing that people don’t see what they’re doing as abnormal.”He very rarely takes selfies now. “I just don’t feel the need to do it.”• The Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation can be found at bddfoundation.org "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09a2111a39caa9434009db88b3da0af25b894806/334_276_4985_2991/master/4985.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0a506c3cdca0a77aa1e9aadb4d24ba5","title":"they couldnt do more for you small details make torquay bandb a winner","story":"Pair who run the 25 say award was a ‘pretty big shock’ – but customers are less surprisedAndy and Julian Banner-Price have spent a small fortune on providing their guests with comfy beds, hi-tech gadgets and power showers. But it is the smaller details that visitors to the 25 in Torquay tend to comment on: the personal greeting at the door on arrival, the handwritten notes of welcome in the rooms, Andy’s baked goodies that await after a hard day’s sightseeing.Though the B\u0026ampB – newly crowned the world’s best – is closed at the moment for a winter break, the couple were there on Tuesday getting ready for their first visitors of 2019, who will arrive next month. Andy was busy preparing beds while Julian was up a ladder dusting light fittings.They received news of their accolade towards the end of a rather trying redecorating session. “It hadn’t been a brilliant day,” said Andy. “It was a pretty big shock. We had to sit down.”No 25 Avenue Road is an Edwardian building a few minutes’ walk from the waterfront. When they took it over, it had 10 bedrooms. They knocked walls down and added others in to create six larger, much more luxurious rooms. They thought carefully about the position of every plug socket, every light, every bin. One of their own bugbears when they visited another hotel or B\u0026ampB, they said, was that teabag-dripping walk from the kettle to the waste basket.If they were shocked at the recognition, their customers weren’t. “Not a surprise at all,” said Simon Bexx, a company director who has visited three times with his wife, Jenny. “I was at a big hotel in Mayfair recently but The 25 was better than that. It’s spotless, they couldn’t do more for you. The attention to detail is just amazing.”Online reviews are just as positive. One contented visitor, Emily Jenkins, said she had asked if there was a different kind of pillow available and was impressed when Andy produced not one alternative but an “array” for her to choose from.Other happy guests rave about features ranging from the heated bathroom mirrors that do not mist up to the online tutorial for the whizzy coffee machines.Not quite anyone is welcome, however. The B\u0026ampB is for adults only and just one pet is allowed: Andy and Julian’s dog, a miniature schnauzer called Patsy.The Banner-Prices arrived on the English Riviera after spending seven years running a successful country house hotel in north Wales. They fell in love with the feel of The 25 and were not put off by the association of Torquay with the sitcom Fawlty Towers or by outdated notions of what a B\u0026ampB is.Andy said he had always enjoyed John Cleese and Connie Booth’s BBC sitcom and the pair relished showing visitors that English seaside B\u0026ampBs were not all about paper-thin walls and strict curfews. “We love to convert people to the idea of the B\u0026ampB,” he said.

With the video fast approaching 300m views on YouTube, this catchy afropop song made Nakamura’s the queen of the French urban music scene last year. But while the 23-year-old’s voice playfully switches between singing and soft rap, the bittersweet track finds Nakamura calling out a guy who has been lying about having sex with her. “You think about me while I think about making money,” she sings (in French), witheringly. “I’m not your mother  I’m not going to lecture you.”The song has been hailed as an anthem for female empowerment and taken on a life of its own: Nakamura’s image was used on posters during recent French protests confronting violence against women. Yet the singer is equivocal about the reaction. “It’s cool to be able to represent black women in France,” she says, “but I have my own way of being, my own way of doing things. There’s a problem when people say, ‘You’re the only black woman representing’ – there are others too.”Recently there has been a buzz around French artists breaking into foreign markets, including PNL, the Blaze and Christine and the Queens, but Aya represents something different. Determined and suburban, she talks about making money and dominating men much like Rihanna or Cardi B would. And unlike other French women who have come close to breaking international markets, she is not white, Arab or mixed race. She’s a black woman in an industry known to discriminate in favour of lighter-skinned artists. “Colourism exists in some way everywhere,” she says. “It’s really difficult when there are people trying to pressure you into bleaching your skin, because that’s what they want. You ask yourself: where are we? Why should I do that? This is how I am.”She adds that an idealised image of the all-powerful black woman isn’t helpful. She recently refused a selfie with a fan in Senegal because she was tired from a flight. Media and fans branded her a snob. “People have this image of the black woman who can face anything, but we are just like everyone else.”In fact Nakamura’s appeal lies partly in her demand for that kind of respect – in her song Copines, she shames a guy who has been checking out her friends – and in her music she doesn’t pretend to be approachable. She seems unfazed by the attention resulting from Djadja. “My concept isn’t about making everyone happy,” she says. “When I’m in the studio it’s about what I like ... I don’t worry about everyone getting what I’m saying.”While she appeals to the frustrations that some listeners may share about men, Nakamura also has a softer side. Last month, she released a song called La Dot, about falling for a guy, getting a dowry and wanting “the dream life”. This might seem at odds with some people’s vision of female empowerment, but as a young French Malian woman, Nakamura has her own vision of fairytale romance that speaks to a generation of young women from north and west African backgrounds in France. It takes strong sense of autonomy and self-respect and mixes it with traditional values passed on from older generations.Born Aya Danioko in Mali – Nakamura was adopted as a stage name, inspired by a character from superhero drama Heroes – she came to live in Aulnay-sous-Bois in the suburbs of Paris with her family when she was a baby. Her mother was a griotte, a traditional Malian poet or singer. “If you come from a line of griots you’re automatically categorised by that,” she says. “They tell people’s stories in the villages, and basically performed the role of the media for previous generations.”In her house, uncles and aunts played a big role in teaching the younger ones about Malian culture. Did these women influence the no-nonsense attitude in her music? “No, that was me,” she says. “I’ve always had quite a strong character, ever since I was little.” She is interrupted by her two-year-old daughter. “It’s like having two jobs,” she says of her life as a parent and a rising star. “I work with my family it’s very complicated but it’s OK.”Nakamura pushes back on the suggestion that she is continuing the griot tradition, clarifying that what she does is a little different. Her song about Grammy-award winning Malian singer Oumou Sangaré pays homage to a woman who she grew up admiring, and Sangaré features in the video for the track. “She’s a singer, a businesswoman and she really represents Malian women,” she says passionately. “I really went into fan mode when I met her – she was so beautiful and she really got what I was doing.”Her success over the past year may have pushed her into the spotlight and exposed her to pressure to meet others’ expectations, but Nakamura is adamant that her motivation lies closer to home: “I really want to show my daughter my story and let her know who we are.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/598894f86ee480c5ff67fab53fc469da4a1b0b18/0_149_3318_2397/master/3318.jpg?width=1900\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19730181b28b87c5928194649ad89a7b 1900w","title":"pmqs verdict jeremy corbyn no deal brexit","story":"In an even match, the jibe that the PM has an open door but a closed mind stood outTheresa May and Jeremy Corbyn started by mentioning Holocaust Memorial Day and condemning antisemitism and racism.Corbyn said that, according to the chancellor and the business secretary, say there was a large majority in the Commons against no deal. So would she take it off the table?May said the way to avoid no deal was to pass a deal, adding that she wanted to talk about how to secure support for a deal. Corbyn had been willing to sit down with Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA without preconditions. But he would not sit down with May. In this case, he was neither present nor involved.Corbyn said he did offer to meet May last autumn. While May’s door might be open, her mind was closed. Would May confirm that, if the amendments to stop no deal were passed, she would rule out no deal. May said the amendments did not solve the issue, because they just delayed Brexit.Corbyn said a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs and undermine living standards. Was May’s government ruling out a customs union with the EU?May asked what Labour meant by staying in the customs union. She rattled off a series of questions, and said she would like to talk to Corbyn about it. If he would not talk about it, she said, he had not got a clue.Corbyn said the TUC backed his policy, and the CBI, and the first minsters of Wales and Scotland. He asked could May explain why she was ruling out a customs union and “for once”, could she answer the question.May said when people spoke about it, they wanted businesses to be able to export to the EU without facing tariffs or rules of origin checks. Her deal allowed that, but also allowed the UK to strike its own trade deals.Corbyn said Liam Fox could not name one country he had reached a trade deal with. Why was she willing to sell jobs down the river?May said she wanted a deal that protected jobs. She said Corbyn stood up and delivered phrases but did not know what those phrases meant. And Corbyn had not mentioned the employment figures.Corbyn said May had not mentioned poverty. The door might be open, but minds were closed, he said. He said a third of her government were at the billionaires’ jamboree at Davos. He said May had ruled out the two issues on which there was a majority in Commons: ruling out no deal, and a customs union.May asked why Corbyn would not come and talk about it. She said borrowing was at its lowest level for 16 years, the IMF was predicting higher growth than for some other big economies, and the biggest threat to that would be a Labour government.A high-scoring, and fairly evenly matched PMQs, in which Corbyn probably had the upper hand, because by the end he sounded more reasonable. He devoted all his questions to Brexit, and mostly focused on challenging May to rule out no deal, and to accept the case for the UK staying in a customs union. On the latter point, May was reasonably clear, restating her opposition to a customs union on the grounds that it would not allow the UK to strike its own trade deals.On no deal, she was more evasive. Corbyn asked at one point whether she would accept the amendments tabled ahead of next week’s vote, designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit, if they were passed. This is a crucial question, because it is not clear that the amendments will actually have the impact the MPs who have tabled them hope, and May did not address this point at all, beyond saying that extending article 50 did not absolutely rule out no deal because it only postponed the decision point.The point Corbyn made at the end about May ruling out the two propositions for which there was majority support in the Commons was a strong one. But it was not a clear-cut win for him. Predictably, but not entirely unfairly, May clobbered him in her first response for his decision to boycott her cross-party talks on Brexit by imposing a precondition. (Many people have said he would have been better advised to just turn up, and denounce her inflexibility afterwards.)May also had a good riff about technical aspects of Labour’s customs union policy, which the party has not been able to address. This attack line was well-founded too. But, overall, she came over as harsh and defensive, confirming the jibe Corbyn made about her having an open door but a closed mind. This was probably the best soundbite of the exchange. It was not really Corbyn’s at all, because Hilary Benn first used this line in the Commons on Monday, but so what? Most viewers won’t have realised, and it worked.The right honourable gentleman has been willing to sit down with Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA without preconditions, yet he won’t meet me to talk about Brexit.The international trade secretary promised 40 trade deals the second after Brexit. This morning he couldn’t name a single one … So why is the prime minister prepared to sell people’s jobs and living standards down the river rather than negotiate a customs union that would be part of a sensible deal for the future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7db880319eb61ed218f4d0af274a59df5c4f1a13/0_31_3280_1969/master/3280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=545233618ead6c1ab11eb130405c9b20","title":"sadiq khan makes rent control key plank of mayor re election bid","story":"London mayor will work out blueprint for overhaul of laws for renters before 2020 pollSadiq Khan will make a campaign for wide-ranging rent control the key plank of his 2020 re-election bid, asking the government to give the London mayoralty the power to combat soaring rents in the capital.The mayor of London is to work out a blueprint for an overhaul of the laws for private renters to allow new restrictions on rent to be imposed – a change he could not make without legislation by central government.Khan told the  that the arguments for rent control were “overwhelming and Londoners overwhelmingly want it to happen”, but said he could not make the change within his current remit.“London is in the middle of a desperate housing crisis that has been generations in the making,” Khan said. “I am doing everything in my power to tackle it – including building record numbers of new social homes – but I have long been frustrated by my lack of powers to help private renters.”Recent YouGov research by City Hall, released to the , suggests that two-thirds of the 2.4 million renters in London, more than a quarter of the city, are strongly in favour of pricing controls.However, it is a plan not likely to find favour with the Conservative government. The housing secretary, James Brokenshire, has argued that the controls would lead to poorer housing standards with landlords unable to afford to maintain properties and could also have a dramatic effect on housing supply, with landlords choosing to sell up rather than have their rental income reduced.The blueprint or rent stabilisation or control laws will be devised by Khan’s deputy mayor for housing, James Murray, and the Westminster North MP, Karen Buck, who last year won government support for her private member’s bill to put legally binding standards on rented homes.“London’s private renters are among the worst affected by the housing crisis in the capital, and the laws to protect them are woefully out of date,” Buck said. “We need an approach to rent stabilisation and control that works in London. Once we have set out these proposals, we will argue the case that ministers must support London’s private renters by putting our plans into action.”Most major cities in Europe and North America have some limits on rents in the private sector. In Berlin, rents are controlled both within and between tenancies and New York has some apartments capped by the NYC Rent Guidelines Board, while others have their rent “stabilised” or reset between tenancies.In Scotland, new laws have recently been introduced to allow councils to apply to implement “rent pressure zones”, where rent increases are capped at no higher than inflation.Hannah Slater, the policy manager at the campaign group Generation Rent, said Londoners would welcome any possible changes. “Londoners are paying some of the highest rents in the world and many are struggling to keep a roof over their head in the area they grew up in or close enough to where they work,” she said.“Unaffordable rent increases force people into stressful moves away from neighbourhoods where they have roots, thereby eroding London’s communities. Renters need stability in our homes that can only come from certainty over what rent we pay – but we need to afford a home in the first place.”Khan will face a Conservative challenge from Shaun Bailey, who has been a critic of Khan’s housebuilding record because of numerous delayed housing schemes in the capital, though Labour has blamed Brexit for the construction slowdown and argued the mayor has overseen the building of more new homes in one year than any of his predecessor.Labour’s 2017 manifesto includes a pledge to “introducing controls on rent rises” and to consider giving the mayor of London additional powers given the particular pressures in the capital. Previously the party had promised legislation that landlords would only be able to increase rent for tenants by less than inflation for the duration of a contract."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1453972616579252c1150ddd959af093d18ede77/1593_825_1880_1128/master/1880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=804e207c4a08dff1bae58b355484ec43","title":"how ukip embraced the far right podcast","story":"With Brexit talks stalled and some of its supporters pushing a betrayal narrative, the ’s Peter Walker charts how Ukip has begun rising in the polls again.

He delivered another last night and you can read it here (pdf). I haven’t read it myself yet (they are never short), but I’m told it is as good as all the others.The ’s Peter Foster has posted some highlights in a Twitter thread, starting here.This is from Politico Europe’s Tom McTague. The Yvette Cooper bill intended to prevent the UK leaving the EU without a deal would oblige the PM to seek an extension of article 50 until the ned of 2019 in the event of no deal being agreed by 26 February. McTague suggests that this nine-month extension could turn into a three-month extension as the price for Labour supporting the bill. The European Commission has adopted two legislative proposals to soften the impact on the EU fishing industry if there is a no-deal Brexit, the Press Association reports. The proposals provide for compensation to fishermen and operators in the case of a sudden closure of UK waters to EU boats. And they prepare the way for the EU to offer UK boats access to its waters until the end of 2019 on condition that Britain grants access to its waters for EU boats in return.And this is from the Financial Times’ Alex Barker.Back in the Lords committee, Barclay is saying more about the legislation that would have to be passed in the event of a no-deal Brexit.On the issue of whether there is enough time, Barclay says “risk appetite” would be a factor taken into account. The business managers would have to take a decision.At PMQs Theresa May firmed up her opposition to allowing Scotland to hold a second independence referendum. (To hold a proper, legally valid referendum, Edinburgh needs permission from London.) When Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, called in 2017 for a second independence referendum, May brushed this aside with the response: “Now is not the time.”This afternoon, in response to a question from the Scottish Conservative Stephen Kerr, May seemed to rule one out for good. She told MPs:The last thing we want is a second independence referendum. The United Kingdom should be pulling together, and should not be being driven apart.Sturgeon has responded firmly. In a statement issued ahead of her meeting with May at Number 10 this afternoon, she said:Theresa May fears she would lose an independence referendum and is clearly running scared of the verdict of the Scottish people - who must be sick and tired of being told what the prime minister wantsFrankly, what Scotland needs is much more important than what the prime minister wants. On a daily basis, Brexit is illustrating this fundamental point - Scotland needs the power to take our own decisions. That’s the only way to stop Tory ideologues driving us to disaster and Westminster governments imposing polices we didn’t vote for.The mandate to give the people of Scotland a choice over their future is cast-iron. A majority of MSPs and Scottish MPs returned at the last two general elections support holding an independence referendum in the circumstances in which we now find ourselves.This is a far stronger statement of intent than even the comments that Sturgeon made in advance of her trip to London, when she said that “we have the right to consider other options for our future, including independence.”It’s worth remembering that Sturgeon must balance not only the demands of this Brexit endgame but also calls within her own party for a clearer signal about her referendum plans.The SNP MP and prominent People’s Vote supporter Joanna Cherry has been tweeting today about the possibility of holding a second independence referendum during the transition period.In contrast to Cherry, yesterday the long-serving SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil called on Sturgeon to drop support for a second EU referendum and instead put the case for a fresh vote on Scottish independence to the “fore”, as did Alex Neil, the former SNP health secretary and Brexiteer, last week.Also this week, former justice secretary Kenny MacAskill yesterday called for Sturgeon’s husband, the SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, to “move on” from his position in order to avoid the impression that he was shielding his wife from criticism over her handling of the Alex Salmond sexual harassment investigation. Some paint these critics as elder statesman figures speaking for others who are reluctant to voice their concerns about party strategy in public because of their own, more active positions others point out that these older, white, male voices represent a particular constituency within the party but do not reach beyond that. Nor is it clear what influence, if any, these voices have on Sturgeon’s thinking.Meanwhile, activists within the SNP and across the wider yes movement are split, with some demanding that Sturgeon use her mandate immediately and others urging caution, particularly given the lack of dramatic movement in the polls. Will the waiting be over soon? Sturgeon finally pledged last week to set out her plans for a second independence referendum “in the coming weeks” even if article 50 is extended.Back in the Lords EU committee Barclay claims that some of the opposition to Theresa May’s deal can be “overplayed”. He says the fact that the government was likely to lose meant some opposition MPs, who in other circumstances might have backed the government, decided not to.Turning away from the committee hearing for a moment, this, from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, is interesting ...Hilary Armstrong, a former Labour chief whip, is asking the questions now.Q: What does the PM mean when she says she will change the way she engages with parliament? And when will the government decide it is too late to get a deal?Barclay says the government does not like the way MPs have been using “humble addresses” to get private government papers. So the government has been thinking about how else it can brief MPs. He mentions confidential briefings, and briefings for select committees as option. He suggests committees work more effectively than the Commons chamber.On timing, Barclay says the government wants a decision “as soon as possible”.Barclay says the government is not running down the clock. If there is a deal, it will have to pass legislation, he says. And even if there were to be no deal, the government would still have to pass legislation to prepare for that, he says.Barclay is talking about the proposal to keep the EU in the customs union. He says, if the government pivots in one direction, as well as picking up votes, it may lose them.Q: How is the process working?Barclay says there is an interplay. The EU want to know what the Commons would pass. And the government is trying to work out what different groups in the Commons would accept.The backstop is the main issue in particular, how it would affect the union of the UK, and whether it would be permanent, he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebb573281467845123c913d9421c2a30fed36dbb/0_0_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02c7b6e3c51370d323220fac24c7a5cd","title":"young people how do you feel about your future","story":"With 18-year-olds watching the outcome of Brexit unravel in front of them, we want to hear what you thinkFor years, it has been assumed that young people do not vote, do not take part in politics, and do not care.

Inevitable. This is simply how stuff works. I’m only sorry our denuded empire means Nick can’t be given an Indian province or something. Or at least a go on Malaya.The ways Timothy’s latest appointment were inevitable are many and various, and we’ll come to them shortly. But we must begin with a recap of how we got here. Because, of course, Nick wasn’t always the crayonner of red lines, the taxer of dementia, the shitter of the electoral bed. And, in one potential timeline, the parliamentary-maths-destroyer that ends up causing no-deal Brexit.Not really that long ago in the scheme of things, Nick was Theresa May’s special adviser in the Home Office, where they ran the hostile environment policy that led to the Windrush scandal. In the 2016 EU referendum campaign, he was an avowed leaver. Who knows whether it was his counsel that caused May to refuse to meaningfully surface to fight for Remain, to the point where frustrated campaign coordinators nicknamed her “Submarine May”. But fortuitously, Nick would soon be in No 10 as her joint chief of staff, where he squandered the height of May’s powers to entrench ision rather than heal it, by writing her 2016 conference Citizens of Nowhere speech.Within months, Article 50 was triggered, apparently without May having a clue what she wanted, let alone the cabinet, followed by Timothy shaping the red lines which have so hamstrung her during the Brexit negotiations. He pushed her to call an election, where his dementia tax turned out to be a six-pointer. For Labour.Having resigned after the majority was lost, Nick’s spell in the political wilderness lasted a full seven weeks, during which he devoted himself to helping the communities his balls-up might reasonably be expected to do over. No, wait – I’ve just checked, and apparently he went on his holibobs instead. On his return, he landed two national newspaper columns: one in the  (initially run under the auto-savaging banner “Ways To Win”), and one in the Sun. Despite these platforms, people began to notice a thing about Nick, which was that he was completely, sensationally, historically unable to acknowledge his role in the political shitstorm that was beginning to engulf the UK.So that’s the potted history. And I think you can see that Nick Timothy was, obviously, absolutely destined to pop up in the blazer class of British sport in due course. When asked about his qualifications, I hope he just looked at the appointments panel and went: “Turn on the rolling news.” And as they stared at the 24-hour Brexit crisis, Nick whooped: “THAT’s my CV, baby!”But the latter is just a fantasy sequence, obviously. We know how government (and sports governance) appointments work. The key question at times like this is: “Now, do we know anyone like us, but who’s from … hang on, where is it again? … Ah yes, ‘Birmingham’” But of course! There’s Nick Timothy. Blah-blah clever guy. Blah-blah could-do-something-interesting.”As for any previous pronouncements on sport Nick may have made, an archive trawl throws up the odd delight, such as: “I am not altogether comfortable with our participation in the Ryder Cup team.” He is at least a genuine Aston Villa fan, unlike David Cameron, who I once saw patronise some electrical apprentices with a suffering-fan joke about his club one day winning “the cup”. “Well, I can dream, can’t I?” he grinned ruefully, clearly unaware that Villa were in the FA Cup semi-finals at the time, and within a fortnight would have gone through to the final.The following year, alas, Villa were relegated, and Nick used that moment to pen his most far-reaching sporting thesis to date. “Their lack of commitment on the pitch has been matched only by their arrogance off it,” he observed. High praise. Nick went on to lambast the Villa players for not “showing contrition for their role in the club’s demise”. If the retrospective irony of that were not already too sledgehammer, he then inquired rhetorically: “So what can this sorry story teach us about politics?”Tell us when you find out, buddy. The real politicssports governance lesson is that both are mostly chumocracies which find jobs for chaps who have repeatedly proved their inadequacies. Like a certain type of manager or useless administrator, Timothy will spend the rest of his career walking into positions that attempt to “harness his talents” or “speak to his skillset”. These sort of characters are somehow judged too big to fail.When I heard the news of Timothy’s Commonwealth Games gig, I immediately began anticipating his 2023 self-exculpatory newspaper columns, in which he explained some notional administration cock-up. But then I realised that I was still thinking too small. By that stage, of course, he will have moved on to the chairmanship of the Football Association."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90b94a3d7dea976c34b6b33f40282d78c2a92dab/0_145_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1665e8c15947ec5474fde45b47963d6","title":"push festival review home manchester","story":"Home, ManchesterCuts of the Cloth explores a family torn apart by the state while storyteller Conor A offers an account of chronic illnessNurturing new performances is a balancing act: shows need audiences to develop, but exposing embryonic work too soon can be fatal. At this year’s Push festival, Home’s annual celebration of creative talent in the north-west of England, five new commissions spearhead the programme. Yet often these premieres feel like works-in-progress. There is a fine line between showcasing this work and protecting it by labelling it as “in development”.One of these commissions, Cuts of the Cloth, captures the dystopian mood of the moment. The speaker of Hafsah Aneela Bashir’s one-woman show is a living exhibit, forced to perform in a museum of the near future. The soothing explanatory voiceover has all the neutral, blandly reassuring tones of the 21st-century museum, but its attractions queasily recall the “human zoos” of slavery-era Europe.This is a show about various kinds of surveillance and othering. Bashir begins the performance standing inside a frame, the height and shape of both a museum cabinet and an airport security metal detector. She’s here to warn us about Islamic extremism, in a disturbing “seminar” aimed levelly at the UK government’s anti-radicalisation Prevent programme. She might be speaking from the future, but the target is the present, from racist stopping-and-searching to overzealous safeguarding.The performance’s presentation suggests a finished show, but its muddled structure needs development. As the protagonist narrates how her family has been torn apart by the state, it’s unclear whether we’re still watching the “seminar” or if that frame has been broken. Bashir is best when eloquently raging against Islamophobia, racism and misogyny, ferociously denouncing the many kinds of violence – from bombs to bureaucracy – perpetrated in the name of freedom and democracy. There’s a lot here, and at the moment it strains to hold together.Learning to Swim on an Ironing Board, by contrast, embraces the provisional and the unfinished. Storyteller Conor A is clear that living with chronic illness is a constant work-in-progress, and so is his solo show about fibromyalgia, therapy and eavesdropping. As Conor explains, chronic illness has a rubbish narrative arc. There’s no conflict, crisis and redemption, just a repeating cycle of pain and getting by. But he does his best to give it a shape and a few punchlines, finding humour and hope in the changes that fibromyalgia has brought to his life.The show is framed by Conor’s eavesdropped gems of wisdom, posted on his Overheard in the Arndale social media pages. (Sample: “You can tell a lot about a doctor by the way they put on a rubber glove.”) The earwigging started as a strange form of therapy as Conor tried to unpick the challenges of living with an invisible disability, and it offers a gentle way into what could be tricky subject matter. The performance that follows meanders between Conor’s illness, his therapy sessions and the strange, funny and glorious things people say in a shopping centre.It’s messy, but charmingly so. Accessibility – for both Conor and his audience – is embedded in the piece. There’s a chat at the start to explain how things will work, and Conor takes necessary breaks from performance during video sections. But rather than these adaptations feeling like distractions, they’re integral to a show that is about accepting and making the most of the hand you’ve been dealt. Or as Conor puts it, getting better at not getting better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/916e31e7a616fa732e49a7c080c2d0a43c7129e4/259_431_4353_2612/master/4353.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cf98181d9e185a862f377a839db34ce","title":"showstopper the improvised musical ken campbell west end","story":"It started as a challenge from Ken Campbell in a squat but Showstopper! The Improvised Musical grew into a West End sensation. The pair behind it tell allAcross the road from Victoria Station is one of London’s longest-running musicals, Wicked. Walk further on, past the history-making hit Hamilton, and you’ll find a smaller theatre where a crack squad of performers are putting on their own musical. This one is guaranteed to both open and close on the same night, but it’s no flop. The idea behind the Olivier award-winning Showstopper! The Improvised Musical is that the cast creates a new, never-to-be-repeated production every evening, entirely improvised from audience suggestions. On Wednesday night, they will create their 1,000th show from scratch, more than 10 years after their debut.The Showstopper! phenomenon started with an outlandish challenge laid down by theatrical maverick Ken Campbell. Adam Meggido, who co-created the format with Dylan Emery and still performs with him in the show, recalls attending Campbell’s “workshops in eccentric performance” in a north London squat. “Ken had just come back from Canada where he’d seen a group called Die Nasty. For over 25 years now they’ve done a weekly improvised soap opera. Ken said it was better than stuff that’s scripted.” When Campbell was commissioned to create an entertainment for the Globe, to be performed on Shakespeare’s birthday, he floated the idea of a group of actors improvising Shakespeare – but he had a caveat. Meggido convincingly adopts Campbell’s nasal inflections as he remembers being told: “The thing is, it’s got to be better than the original.”The Shakespeare gig led to similar improv shows at the Royal Court and the group began to riff on the dramatic style of Pinter and Sondheim in their performances. Increasingly, Campbell would tell them: “Do it like it’s a musical. That’s a winner.” Meggido, whose parents were musical-theatre actors, already knew the art form inside out. He learned more about the craft of improvisation from Emery, who was combining an unlikely pair of careers: financial journalism and improv comedy. They built up a team called the Showstoppers today’s company comprises 17 performers including Lucy Trodd and Pippa Evans. Several of them have been members since the early days.The show has been expanded and the formula fine-tuned since their first trip to the Edinburgh fringe. In 2008, they performed in an 89-seat Portakabin at the festival in an 11.30pm slot. It sold out from day one. “We had no idea why,” says Meggido. “There were other groups all over the world doing that kind of thing, but I don’t think anyone else was trying to make it a musical in the same way we were.”Meggido and Emery are hopelessly devoted to the art of the show tune: they genuinely want to create a great musical each night, not just pastiche the genre and have some knockabout fun. So they dress like they mean business. “A lot of improv happens in bars and improvisers generally dress very casually,” explains Emery. “But when you’re in a theatre you want the audience to know this isn’t mucking around.” Meggido adds: “I didn’t want it to look and feel like improv. I wanted it to look and feel like a musical.”For each show, a six-strong squad of Showstoppers wear colour-coded red and black outfits with matching bowling shoes. They are introduced by a sharp-suited character called The Writer (usually played by Emery). The Writer takes a call from a producer named Cameron (one of many winks to the audience) who desperately needs a new musical. The audience must help by supplying a setting, a title and assorted musical styles from which the actors will spin a story.On the night I see them at The Other Palace (for production number 998), we set the show in a funeral parlour (narrowly beating second choice Stonehenge), name it Stiff! and request songs in the key of rock musical Six, Alan Mencken’s The Little Mermaid and Sondheim (“easy to copy,” deadpans The Writer).Almost instantly, the six Showstoppers have created their characters, are singing choruses, keeping just-about-in-sync for salsa routines and finding satisfying rhymes for “formaldehyde”. Their synergy is staggering and a three-piece band onstage don’t miss a beat either. The Writer interrupts proceedings for us to add suggestions. Emery says it’s a highwire act for the cast and The Writer’s job is to wobble the wire if they ever look too comfortable: “You put them in a new situation and see what they can do.”As an audience member you can’t help but try to “solve” the show. Are those melodies pre-arranged? Are there stock characters or situations they use? How much has really been pre-prepared? Nothing, says Meggido. “Audiences want to come back to see the ‘trick’ or find secret signals. But there aren’t any. People think there are set things we fall back on but it’s harder to have something in the back of your mind to fall back on than it is to genuinely improvise the musical. It’s easier just to make it all up.” The Showstoppers, he says, are like a sports team: they train hard, communicate well and “use their skills in the moment”.In the interval, the audience is encouraged to tweet further suggestions for the second half. I wonder if this is when they map out the rest of the show between them backstage but Meggido says they concentrate on firming up the story from Act I, as it all moves so quickly. (Emery later records the title and synopsis of each show they do in an online archive.)The show uses minimal, multi-purpose props and those red-and-black outfits have been cleverly designed, by Gabriella Slade, to suit a range of musical styles and eras. Emery uses a frock coat as an example: “You put it on and you could be an American general in the civil war, a doorman at the Dorchester or an 18th-century gentleman.”The Showstoppers empire now includes a 45-minute version for kids. “We only take suggestions from the children,” explains Meggido. “It’s just a big game of ‘what happens next?’ We do whatever the kids say.” Emery says the older children are often very good at making sense of the plot and creating a structure, while the younger ones “are more likely to go somewhere fun and exciting. You need both elements to create a really satisfying story. The kids show is probably the most fun we have. We’re basically doing as little improvisation as possible. It’s so liberating and it’s good training because, in the main show, everyone is worried constantly about where the story is going. Is it making sense? Are people emotionally attached to it?”I wonder how stressed they get each night – for most of us in the audience, singing a song onstage would be bad enough, never mind making up your own lyrics and dance routines. Meggido explains the ethos: “I want us to be a bunch of naive clowns who don’t get how terrifying what they’re doing is.” The key, he says, is “to be completely present and free from tension as much as possible. Anything I’ve done in my life creatively that felt any good, it didn’t feel like I was doing it. It felt like I was a channel for something that was happening … The more relaxed I am, the more present, it becomes obvious what to do next. The more tense and less connected I am, the more I have to strain. But it’s not necessarily a better or worse result. You can create through relaxation or tension.”One day, they plan to perform a show with all 17 of the Showstoppers on stage for the full chorus-line effect. In the meantime, a handful of them will continue to turn up at the theatre in Victoria each night, arriving without a character’s name, a line of dialogue or a single lyric between them. And then these improv wizards will teach Elphaba a thing or two about defying gravity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b972f006670ed0b19afabe3e91a65a5ba53998e1/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e2dd5fde3942573e202d6abb6b30ff77 1400w","title":"the slumflowers guide to peckham londons coolest neighbourhood","story":"We spoke to blogger and author Chidera Eggerue (AKA the Slumflower) as part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series – where innately curious people reveal the ‘ordinary’ places and things that inspire them. All images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Stephanie Sian SmithVibrant, arty and home to one of London’s most erse communities, Peckham has cemented itself as a true cultural hotspot – with creative hub Peckham Levels, the legendary Bussey Building and no shortage of galleries and cafes just a few of its draws. But long before SE15 was named by Time Out as one of the world’s coolest neighbourhoods, it was the stomping ground of blogger and best-selling author Chidera Eggerue.With 187,000 Instagram followers, Eggerue is now known globally by her online moniker, the Slumflower – a name borrowed from Street Etiquette’s concept of a rose growing from concrete. Her debut book, What a Time to be Alone: the Slumflower’s Guide to Why You Are Already Enough, is now in its third print run and she has recently published her second, Scribble Yourself Feminist. Growing up in south-east London, Eggerue mirrors the Slumflower message of growing, glowing and flourishing in an urban environment. Here, she presents her very personal guide to Peckham, reflecting on the everyday extraordinary places that fire up her imagination …Taste some proper Nigerian foodI live with my mum and two brothers and I don’t really eat out much as my mum is an amazing cook. She makes jollof rice, egusi (a type of melon seed) soup, beans and yam. She also shops local and buys her meat and vegetables from the market in Peckham.But if you want to know a good Nigerian restaurant in the area, I would suggest 805 Restaurants – I get plantain and jollof rice. Afterwards, stop by Cafe Spice, a small, yellow shop opposite the Bussey Building. Look out for a Nigerian snack called a puff puff, which is very sweet and like a fried doughnut.Kick back with a drinkJohn the Unicorn is really nice, or Prince of Peckham – it does great chicken, and has really good DJ sets and there’s a party room upstairs. It’s quite new but it’s where I’d go with friends now. People do of course go on to club nights at the CLF Art Cafe – known locally as the Bussey Building (during the summer months there’s a rooftop bar and cinema), but I’m like an 80-year-old granny and just go home!Head to the only cinema worth knowing aboutOnce a month I take myself on an evening date to watch a film at Peckhamplex. I’ve been going there since I was born and it’s still the only cinema I go to – at a fiver a ticket, you can’t go wrong. I saw the new Incredibles film recently, which I loved it was so cute. Going there and having time to myself is important. What is now above it – the creative workplay hub that is Peckham Levels – used to be a multi-storey car park. My dad used to park there before we went to the cinema and he’d whizz around the levels, it was so much fun. Frank’s Cafe is there now, on the rooftop, but it’s not really my thing.Look out for inspiring wall artWhen I was younger, there was a wall by Peckham library with photos of famous black actors, who I very much aspired to be. The bus I took to secondary school went past it, so I’d see them every day from age 11 to 16. Now the murals are on the walls of the Peckhamplex, which I love.Hit up my beauty go-tosPaks Hair and Cosmetics is where I get my hair treatments, conditioners and extensions. I also go to Anna’s nail shop once a month to get my nails done. (Find it in Ali Baba’s barber shop on 127 Rye Lane.) It’s £25 and quite expensive. I always get pointy nails shellac all the way. I get the brightest, neon colours I can. My tip? Get Anna’s son to do them – he’s the best.Get a coffee fixI get my coffee at the Costa on Rye Lane every day, but it’s not very Peckham! It used to be a Mothercare. My mum would always go in there with me and just the other day I was looking at an old film of me in there, which we still have on tape. There was more footage of me in my pram and walking through Peckham. There were green buses then – they were so cool – and the McDonalds is in shot, which is still there.Find some headspaceSexby Garden in Peckham Rye Park is my hideout, my reflection spot – my secret favourite place.

As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we’re taking a look at a new cohort of influencers determined to use their devices for more than just selfies. All images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Laura McCluskeyThey’re often the first thing we look at when we wake up, the last thing we see before we go to bed, and most of us couldn’t go a few hours without thinking about them. No, not our loved ones, but our phones. According to data from Ofcom, people in the UK now check their smartphones – averaged out of a waking day – every 12 minutes. But instead of seeing that as bad, throwing our devices in the sea and going to live in a cave, a new movement suggests that it’s time to re-evaluate our relationship with social media. Instead of seeing it as a time-sucking temptation that turns us into head-down zombies, used in the right way our smartphones might actually be our best tool for enabling memorable real-world moments and making every day more extraordinary.Ironically, it’s social media influencers who are leading the charge for sustainable use of the medium and the beauty of sharing more meaningful content, even if that means sharing less. Author and broadcaster Emma Gannon is the author of Ctrl Alt Delete, which examines the millennial phenomenon of growing up online and balancing the demands of being an influencer with having a private life.“I started to use social media when I was 11 or 12,” she says. “People say the dopamine rush from social media is like having a hug, so we shouldn’t feel bad when someone retweets us 100 times because that feels amazing. But I think it can be a dangerous cycle if that’s the only way to feel good.“I think the more someone is sharing, the more they need validation. As I grow up, I share less because I feel more confident. I don’t need everyone to know what I’m doing all the time because I just feel happy doing it.”Just as the idea of slow living is gaining popularity, so too is slow social media. Fashion journalist Pandora Sykes describes herself as an “accidental influencer” and recently wrote a blog post about conscious sharing. “Call it selfish (I prefer self-protection), but I’ve recently drawn some parameters in the sand,” she writes.Someone who knows only too well the importance of balancing mental health and social media is Katherine Ormerod. With 49.5k followers and a steady income from Instagram posts, her life online looks like an endless stream of sunset selfies and glamorous parties. “I spent years putting on a great show that my life was pretty perfect, and it was exhausting. Then my husband left me when I was 29 and I couldn’t fake it any more,” she says.In her book Why Social Media Is Ruining Your Life, she speaks to influencers who reveal what their lives are really like away from the glossy hair and chia seed smoothies. “At times, I’ve legitimately loved taking pictures, felt creatively challenged and fulfilled, genuinely happy that I’ve finally found somewhere to express myself,” she says. “But I’ve also dealt with the full gamut of emotion that social media can generate. It’s made me want to buy things I can’t afford, made me feel like I’m lazy in comparison to other people and, at times, made me feel very low. It’s also made me feel overweight, unattractive, poor, unstylish, lonely, left out, unpopular and seriously devoid of a sense of humour.”But by realigning our thoughts about our online lives, Ormerod says it is possible to find your digital happy place. “Social media is here to stay, as are our phones, and while ‘off-gridding’ for a certain amount of time is gaining popularity, for most of us it’s really a matter of conscious, mindful consumption,” she says.“We can carve out a new path for a healthy and beneficial relationship, one where we are in the driving seat, controlling our intake and uptake of these digital platforms so they work for us. Instead of wasting any more time ‘comparing despairing’ or zooming in on our saggy knees.”Similarly, Catherine Price, author of How to Break Up With Your Phone, spent 18 months researching mindfulness and neuroplasticity to develop a comprehensive strategy for how to consciously uncouple with her device from time to time. “I still wanted to use social media, but I wanted a new relationship with it – one with better boundaries, and over which I had more control,” she says. “The goal wasn’t to never use my phone again it was to create a sustainable relationship that felt healthy.”Ormerod agrees and says that it’s not just about unfollowing people who make you feel insecure, it’s about seeking out those who educate and illuminate – the people who inspire you to see the everyday world in a different way. “Find content that is going to inspire you and you’re going to have a far, far better experience.”Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e75ace068a76be2c12679dc5bce942d8956c7c1/697_556_698_419/master/698.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e585baefee96e764e01762b4c080e734","title":"power mentors the community activists inspiring young londoners","story":"Anyone’s surroundings can inspire them to change their life – you just have to be willing to see the world with fresh eyes. As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we meet a new breed of activists, such as ex-gang member Karl Lokko, who demonstrate just how important this is. Images captured on the Google Pixel 3When Karl Lokko was 12 years old, his life took its first swerve towards danger. He saw someone shot for the first time, on Brixton’s Myatts Field estate, the south London housing block he called home. For years, the estate had earned a reputation as a place where families and children lived in the crossfire of local conflicts. And for a time, it seemed as though Lokko would commit his life to the gang culture that seemed to thrive in his area. Now, though, he considers that estate one of the most meaningful places in his life.“It had a terrible reputation – branded at one point by the press as the ‘Devil’s Den’,” he says. Even then, it was still the backdrop for the childhood games he remembers playing with friends: “Knock down ginger, 4040 home, run outs and park-swing Olympics.” It’s also where Lokko met Pastor Mimi Asher as a young adult – the woman who would eventually turn his life around.And that’s where Lokko’s story leaps from the everyday into the extraordinary. He didn’t follow a route carved out for him, leading away from school and into life on the streets. Instead, the 28-year-old found himself – and a new focus – as close to home as the gangland distractions. He’s grown into one of several inspiring Londoners who’ve used their combination of experience and personal knowledge to turn well-known spaces and activities into life-changing sites of positive change.In Lokko’s case, that came down to how Asher refocused his energy, leading him to a very different life. As in giving TEDx Talks, striking up a friendship with Prince Harry and working as a charity ambassador. By grabbing his life by the lapels and steering it in a new direction, the poet, activist and influencer has matured into someone who’s able to see the mundane in a new light. Lokko credits Pastor Asher for nudging him away from criminality. She would open her flat on the estate to him and other vulnerable young men. And inside, she ran a Christian faith group, which she described to the  as being less about God and scripture and more “about helping to give young men identity, value and something to believe in”.Other innovators similarly use their surroundings as a springboard for community work and making a positive impact. Fellow poet Momtaza Mehri takes inspiration from her London upbringing and Somali heritage to write forceful works that vibrate with the capital’s energy. As this year’s young people’s laureate for London, she tackles everything from gentrification to race, street violence and the living, breathing history of her city. Mehri says her writing is invested in “questions or ideas around disruption or movement, whether it’s movement of people or places, movement between different ideas, between how things change over different generations, and in themes of migration and urban spaces”.Elsewhere in the city, Tanya Compas and Charlie Dark work in separate disciplines but both help their communities see themselves in newly affirming ways. Compas is a youth worker, who – through workshops, events and education – empowers young women of colour to see their worth. She’s won several awards, and is one of the Evening Standard’s 1,000 most influential Londoners. Dark founded Run Dem Crew, a running group that began to help inspire young men of colour that has now turned into a city-wide phenomenon in London.Finally, groups such as Muslim Girls Fence – using the sport of fencing to break down stereotypes about Muslim women – and the Big House, bringing isolated care leavers into theatre production, show what can happen when collectives help amplify marginalised voices. As Sarah Saaed, a teenage Muslim Girls Fence mentor put it, the programme “gives me power. It makes me feel like I have strength and I am powerful, and I’m strong and resilient.” Both programmes excel at allowing their participants to see themselves anew.As for Lokko, he’s developed his poetry and songwriting around the city since Asher demonstrated how Myatts Field estate and the wider community could provide inspiration rather than stir up fear. Take the underground, for example: specifically, the Victoria line’s southernmost stop. “As a Brixton boy, any commute across the city started from this point. But what became apparent to me after a while is that poetry was always a by-product on these trips,” says Lokko.And so he wrote the majority of his first poetry collection, The Butterfly Effect, zooming along in tube carriages, he says. “The underground was where people made contact but rarely connected. The British reserve gave way for silence on crowded carriages that would usher, for me, creativity.” Anyone’s surroundings can turn into sites for new potential – you just have to be willing to see your world with fresh eyes.Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cce673e30312e296798c9e41d674ad77a827339/372_146_2367_1420/master/2367.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=158919e6ed16a60abfe32c2fab7ff0cb","title":"how elon musks secretive foundation benefits his own family","story":"Some of the Musk Foundation’s grants have benefited AI research, his brother’s charity, his children’s school and his fight against LA trafficThe entire website of Elon Musk’s private charitable foundation is shorter than many of the Tesla CEO’s contentious tweets. “Musk Foundation. Grants are made in support of: Renewable energy research and advocacy Human space exploration research and advocacy Pediatric research Science and engineering education,” the site reads.Documents obtained by the  reveal how the foundation has put that vague mission statement into practice. Together, the documents show that many of the organization’s donations have gone far beyond its stated scope. Some have benefited the billionaire’s own family and initiatives, others have tackled his pet peeves – the foundation has given more money to Musk’s own artificial intelligence research than to any of the more traditional charities it says it supports.As with many other of his achievements, Musk has publicly touted his charitable activities, whether during the Flint water crisis or amid international efforts to rescue a young soccer team trapped in a Thai cave. Musk has given personally to multiple causes and organizations, including multi-million dollar donations to the Sierra Club and the XPrize Foundation, and a $1m grant to the Obama Foundation. But the bulk of his charitable giving has been through this private foundation, for which he provides the entirety of its funding.The Musk Foundation has disbursed more than $54m in 15 years of operations, more than a third in direct gifts to 160 charities, according to an analysis of filings with the Internal Revenue Services from its incorporation in 2001 to the middle of 2017. Most recorded awards totalled just a few thousand dollars, and many went to environmental, educational, medical, and space advocacy organizations.Others, however, landed closer to home. Recipients have included a school attended by Musk’s own children, a charity managed by his brother, a protest group fighting gridlock on Musk’s commute to SpaceX, and even an art project at Musk’s favorite festival, Burning Man.In 2012, Musk joined billionaires like Michael Bloomberg and Warren Buffett in signing The Giving Pledge, a commitment by some of the world’s richest iniduals to give away the majority of their wealth, either during their lifetimes or upon their deaths. Musk – who controls Tesla, SpaceX and The Boring Company – is worth an estimated $22bn, although almost all his wealth is tied up in his own companies.Musk had started organizing his charity givings more than a decade earlier.Musk launched his foundation in 2001, together with his younger brother Kimbal, who’d serve as the organization’s secretary and treasurer. Musk’s first big gift to the foundation came the following year, shortly after eBay bought PayPal, the payments company that Musk had an interest in. Musk gave his organization 30,000 eBay shares, worth $2.1m.In those early days, the foundation made small, uncontroversial donations to Musk’s alma maters in South Africa and the US, to other educational charities, space societies, and children’s hospitals such as the Seattle Children’s Hospital and the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles.Between 2007 and 2014, Musk topped up the foundation’s coffers with a little over $3.1m in cash. The list of its recipients grew longer – and began to feature more organizations with links to Musk’s own family and interests.The foundation funded photovoltaic systems helping communities affected by the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 and the Fukushima earthquake in 2011. Musk’s solar power company Solar City (now part of Tesla) participated in both installations.Also in 2010, the foundation spent $183,000 to help launch Kitchen Community, a Colorado-based charity headed by Kimbal that used “learning gardens” in underserved areas to help children grow and prepare fresh food. Kitchen Community, now called Big Green, would receive a total of nearly half a million dollars over the next four years – one of the foundation’s largest direct awards. As executive director and chairman of the project, Kimbal received nearly $85,000 in payments by Big Green between 2010 and 2016.Between 2011 and 2013, the foundation also made two $50,000 donations to the Mirman School for gifted children in Los Angeles, a school that Elon Musk’s sons were attending at the time. Musk later started his own not-for-profit school, Ad Astra, located within SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California, which his children now attend.In 2012, the year Musk signed the giving pledge, the foundation expanded its horizons and donated to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Los Angeles Police Foundation, and a non-profit organization for professional women in New York’s film, television and digital media industries.It also made three $25,000 payments to a tiny pressure group called Angelenos Against Gridlock. The group was lobbying for improvements to the famously congested Interstate 405 highway that Musk uses regularly to commute from his Bel-Air home to SpaceX. Angelenos Against Gridlock is now defunct, and Musk has turned his attention to building tunnels to whisk Tesla electric cars swiftly beneath the city’s traffic instead.The high point of 2012 was possibly a $10,000 donation to the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (Maps), a nonprofit that is developing medical therapies using marijuana and MDMA. That donation helped fund the Temple of Whollyness, a large wooden art structure that went up in smoke at the climax of 2013’s Burning Man festival in Nevada.By mid 2015, the Musk Foundation was down to its last $60,000. The following May, Musk donated 1.2 million shares of Tesla Motors, valued at nearly $255m at the time.Musk has long worried about the possibilities of superhuman, malevolent artificial intelligence, likening it to “summoning the demon”. In 2015, he had pledged $1bn to a set up a research company called OpenAI that would develop safer AI in a “way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole”.“Elon’s charitable giving has kick-started AI safety research, transforming it into what is now a vibrant and respectable research area,” said Max Tegmark, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who personally received $9m from Musk for research at the Future of Life Institute.But in 2016, the IRS was still processing OpenAI’s non-profit status, making it impossible for the organization to receive charitable donations. Instead, the Musk Foundation gave $10m to another young charity, YC.org. The charity lacks a website or social media presence but its stated aim is “making grants to other 501(c)3 initiatives and activities that are trying to solve the world’s problems”.Filings show the organization is run by Sam Altman, a director of OpenAI and the president of Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley accelerator that has helped to launch hundreds of technology start-ups, including Airbnb, Cruise Automation and Dropbox. Altman is also a director of OpenAI.The Musk Foundation’s grant accounted for the majority of YC.org’s revenue, and almost all of its own funding, when it passed along $10m to OpenAI later that year. Open AI’s tax filings show its top researcher alone was paid $1.9m in 2016. Though that’s not out of line with what some top AI researchers make, it’s more than the Musk Foundation handed out to all other charitable causes during its first eight years of operation.Also in 2016, the Musk Foundation made its largest disbursement to date, giving $37.8m to Vanguard Charitable. It’s a donor-advised fund – a tax-efficient giving vehicle that holds money on behalf of multiple clients and distributes it over time. This type of structure makes it difficult for the public to tell which client is making which awards, a benefit for the publicity-shy.While secrecy was not Musk’s motivation for using donor-advised funds, he does believe that true philanthropy is done for the most part anonymously, a spokesperson for the foundation told the .There are some hints that the foundation could be returning to grassroots giving. Last summer, Musk tweeted that he would help address the public health crisis in Flint, Michigan. The foundation said that it has donated more than $1m worth of water filtration equipment and laptops to causes in the city. But, if Musk continues to use Vanguard, it would make his already secretive foundation even less transparent in future years.Neither Elon nor Kimbal have ever accepted any compensation for their work with the foundation, nor are there any other salaried staff at the organization, filings indicate.None of Musk’s charitable decisions are particularly uncommon for a billionaire’s private foundation, said Harvey Dale, director of the National Center on Philanthropy and the Law at New York University. Many wealthy iniduals fund their children’s schools, and support their own charities and initiatives, he explained.Even the foundation giving money to Big Green, which in turn paid Kimbal, may not be problematic. Big Green did not respond to requests for comment, but the Musk Foundation noted that Elon Musk has no involvement in Big Green and was unaware of any payments to Kimbal. It also said that those payments have now stopped.On Wednesday, the foundation added aline to its website, stating its support for the “development of safe artificial intelligence to benefit humanity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5413416b1692a71d53a43168ffa1cabb9ce2c7c0/0_13_800_480/master/800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2973f1038349b7c6c917c5526164079c","title":"2019 hoscars winners worlds best hostels solo independent travel","story":"Prague hostel wins trio of titles in annual hostel awards, which has introduced new solo travel categories to reflect rise in independent travellersSolo travellers praised the Roadhouse’s large shared spaces, group walking tours, organised trips to local festivals and home-from home touches, including Netflix and nightly “family dinners”.

Brits continue to favour south-east Asia, voting Cozy Nook Hostel in Da Lat in Vietnam top (from £5.84), followed by Lub D Cambodia in Siem Reap (from £9.37) and Stamps Backpackers in Chang Mai, Thailand (from £7.10).In the UK, Wombats City Hostel in east London (from £25.48), with its vaulted-ceiling bar and all-you-can-eat breakfast, was named top hostel in England family-run River House in Cardiff (from £20) was top in Wales rural Skyewalker Hostel on Isle of Skye (from £20) for Scotland and friendly Global Village hostel in the vibrant Queen’s Quarter of Belfast (from £14.50), topped the Northern Ireland ratings.“This year’s annual Hoscars mark a momentous 20 years since Hostelworld received its first booking in 1999,” says Hostelworld’s Gary Morrison. “A lot has changed since then, including the quality and variety of hostels … and the ability for backpackers to search, plan and book on the go via our mobile app.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031ccae077441b66149e4aaec0ddf87445ff4cc9/0_226_6464_3879/master/6464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=810db0c860a1272c1caa396d6256638b","title":"british asian 30 years of sunrise radio","story":"As Sunrise Radio marks three decades on air, British Asian stars from Bobby Friction to Nabihah Iqbal open up about roots, racism and rebellionWhile I was growing up in Hounslow, my grandmother lived with us for 10 years. I remember many things from that time: the rich smell of her cooking the endless TV she would consume, from 60s Bollywood movies to Neighbours the thickness of her reading glasses. But above all, I recall the constant crackle of an AM signal tuning in to Sunrise Radio.For my grandma, Sunrise was a connection to the India she had left 30 years before. People she knew would ring in to debate current affairs or gossip the high-pitched voices of singers Asha Bhosle and Lata Mangeshkar would ring out. Prayers would be played on festive occasions. To me, this was all just noise. I wanted Kiss FM or Choice. I found Asian music embarrassing and shrill, and the talk shows made no sense. But to the over three million British Asians living in the UK, independent radio stations such as Sunrise in London, Asian Sound in Manchester and Sabras in Leicester were a way of connecting to their fragmented communities.This month, Sunrise celebrates its 30th anniversary. It is now a nationwide service and the world’s first commercial 24-hour Asian radio station. It is a clear example of how Asian music and its broadcasting platforms have flourished in Britain to cater to its demographic, despite changing tastes. Even the establishment has taken note, with the BBC’s Asian Network reaching its 17th year of broadcasting, having recovered from the threat of closure in 2010.Starting life as a pirate station in the early 1980s in Southall, Sunrise expanded from west London to the West Midlands and Yorkshire after receiving its license in 1989. Jay Sean, one of the first British Asian artists to have mainstream success after support from Asian radio, says Sunrise was a staple for him and his peers. “Growing up in Southall in the 90s, everyone was listening, especially my parents,” he says. “Their jingle is still stuck in my head.”Ravi Sharma, one of Sunrise’s first presenters, says radio that spoke to British Asians on its own terms was rebellious. “People who have stayed rooted to their culture in this country are swimming against the tide,” he says. “They are expected to integrate into Western culture and leave their heritage behind, so for Sunrise to provide access to these roots is of paramount importance.”Yet this rootedness in the immigrant experience also made young people shy away from stations like Sunrise. Former Radio 1 DJ and current Asian Network presenter Bobby Friction says he saw the station as something for the older generation. “My issue was that it mainly served my parents’ tastes,” he says. British Asian jazz musician Arun Ghosh puts it down to political context. “For British Asians in the 80s and 90s, you had to negotiate a lot of racism,” he says. “So at the time I didn’t admit to liking any Asian music, out of fear or shame.”As the millennium arrived, listenerships were dwindling. Sunrise went from 399,000 listeners in 1999 to stagnate at 332,000 by 2006. Competing for a share of this already-reduced audience, the BBC combined its local Asian radio programming in Leicester and Birmingham and launched the national Asian Network in 2002. “It was a watershed moment – the first time there was a UK-wide focus on the Asian audience. We were being recognised and legitimised,” says current Asian Network controller Mark Strippel.Composer Nitin Sawhney thinks the launch of Asian Network “was an excuse not to have Asian DJs on mainstream radio. Before that, there was a real influx of Asians into the mainstream,” he says. “Talvin Singh got nominated for a Mercury prize and won it. I got nominated, and Asian Dub Foundation and Cornershop were signed to major labels. In the years after, it felt like a segregation took place. Asian Network became a box to put everything in and as a result, there wasn’t an encouragement of new Asian music.”Strippel says Asian Network is shifting focus to 15-34 year olds. “Our programming is now in English,” he says, “and it connects to young British Asians who might be proud of their heritage but who also won’t be fluent in Punjabi and who listen to bhangra mixed with hip-hop and grime. That’s the new generation’s perspective and that’s what they want to hear.”Asian Network is also recruiting younger presenters, such as breakfast host Harpz Kaur and drivetime’s Yasser, who combine Asian music with debate on everything from cultural appropriation to body positivity. The strategy seems to be paying off, with over 600,000 people tuning in every week.Sunrise has followed suit, producing ratings second only to Asian Network. “We needed the latest talent and that’s what I had to bring in,” says Tony Lit, Sunrise’s managing director. “I sincerely believe the younger generation still want to be in tune with their culture. They might go through their teenage years where they distance themselves, but when they go to college or university, they develop pride in their community and culture.”Where Sunrise and Asian Network erge, though, is on the topic of musical integration. Asian Network is incorporating the left-field sounds of residents such as Nabihah Iqbal and DJ Manara’s mix of contemporary Bollywood with dancefloor electronics, prompting Strippel to compare the future of British Asian music to the ascension of grime. “Where black British music took off around five years ago, we’re going to see a blooming of British Asian talent now,” he says, “and Asian Network will be at the forefront.”Bobby Friction, who was one of the first Asian presenters on national radio, is enthusiastic about the change. “The Asian Network didn’t used to feel like it was the space for the expression of a British Asian identity,” he says, “but today, it is exactly what it should be. It excels in being a British station for anyone from any background.”Sunrise, however, is resolutely sticking to its formula. “I don’t think Asian music would be absorbed into the mainstream, I don’t think it can be,” breakfast presenter Raj Ghai says. “It would be suicide to put it on Radio 1 since it would alienate English listeners.” Lit is more measured, but agrees that “a hybrid service playing both Asian and English music would not work now – people want something they know and trust.”For Ghosh, there needs to be an amalgam: “We’ve got a really specific cultural heritage but we’re also part of a multicultural society. We have to be separate and we have to be together.”Sawhney, meanwhile, has the pithy maxim: “Where there is cross-fertilisation there is relevance, where there is ghettoisation, it is complete fucking bullshit.” He continues that while Asian radio may pigeonhole talent, it is a necessary means to visibility: “Asian radio makes sure people have a perception of Asians being part of an integrated society, so they don’t start talking about Britain being a country of only white people. It’s multicultural and pluralistic.”Multicultural Britain is one built by a generation of immigrants such as my grandma, tax-paying workers whose colonial passports made them as proud to be British as they were to stay rooted to their cultures. My grandma passed away suddenly, aged 89, while I wrote this article, after over 50 years living in England. This year, I’ll be – for once – tuning in to her favourite station, not just for remembrance but to appreciate how something as simple as a song can bring back the memory of home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/818fb6162505d314310978bcf7bcc280683b3227/80_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbd828aa5d8afd8ea5c62ba7a5edcf73","title":"controversy students mock native american strikes national chord","story":"Debate around the incident reverberated culturally and politically amplified by an aggressive entry into the argument by TrumpThe spectacle of a crowd of white teens in pro-Trump caps mocking a Native American activist on the National Mall just days before Martin Luther King Jr day was perhaps not needed to demonstrate that America’s social fabric is stretched thin.The explosion of a media controversy around the incident was probably not necessary to drive participants in the ensuing debate into their usual partisan crouches.And the role of an apparent imposter Twitter account in originally pushing video of the confrontation to go viral was not required to underscore how vulnerable the national dialogue still is to social media hijacking, less than two years out from the 2020 elections.But those elements combined help to explain why the showdown on the Mall between Covington Catholic high school students demonstrating against abortion rights and two other groups has struck a national chord, with reverberations in culture and politics amplified by an aggressive entry into the argument by Donald Trump himself.“The students of Covington have become symbols of Fake News and how evil it can be,” Trump tweeted on Tuesday. “They have captivated the attention of the world, and I know they will use it for the good – maybe even to bring people together. It started off unpleasant, but can end in a dream!”It was unclear whether Trump intended to echo King, who delivered his “I have a dream” speech at the very site of the clash, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.Trump’s sure intent, however, was to vindicate the racist and mob-like conduct of some students in the affair by pointing out, as Fox News had already done, that early video of the incident did not capture a previous war of insults at the scene between the Covington students and a small group of confrontational African American evangelists called the Black Hebrew Israelites.Opinions erge – along ideological lines, of course – on whether full-length video of the scene cast the students’ conduct in a different light. The video does capture a moment in which a student takes off his shirt and leads his classmates in a chant, which they heartily join, in the style of a football cheer, or a Trump campaign rally.“In this case the facts happened to support the rightwing tribe,” wrote the conservative New York Times columnist David Brooks.On the contrary, wrote Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo, watching every available video “doesn’t greatly change the substance of what you see on the video, which is a middle aged Native American activistelder beating a ceremonial drum in the face of what appears to be a bemused and cocky teenager while his classmates surrounding them, mostly wearing Maga caps, jeer and taunt the man with chopping motions.”Maga: Make America Great Again. The northern Kentucky county where Covington Catholic is located voted for Trump by a 26-point margin. It is also in the heart of a region on the radar of the Southern Poverty Law Center for its proliferation of hate groups, including white supremacist and radical Christian identity groups.After originally censuring the students and vowing consequences, Covington has in recent days deployed media surrogates to defend itself, to argue that the students were not at fault, and their actions on video had been misunderstood.In a strong indicator of the political undertones of the argument taking shape, the school’s public relations firm is closely tied to Mitch McConnell, the senate majority leader from Kentucky, noted Democratic strategist Adam Parkhomenko.In a national television interview broadcast on Wednesday morning, the student at the center of the spectacle, Nicholas Sandmann, repeated a claim he made Sunday, that he was trying to defuse the situation, wearing a smile of silent prayer, not a condescending smirk, as he stood nose-to-nose with Omaha tribe elder Nathan Phillips.The forensic, and remarkably sharp, debate over what the video exactly shows is another typical feature of the national moment. Trump began his presidency by asking people not to believe photographs showing that his inauguration drew a relatively small crowd. More recently, Trump claimed that he had never said that Mexico would pay for a border wall, despite miles of video evidence to the contrary.The loud disagreement between the political camps over whose side the evidence is on seems unlikely to resolve itself soon. But after a presidential election in which the pernicious influence of imposter social media accounts has been widely documented, the question of exactly who is goading the two sides to battle seems worthy of examination.The original viral Covington video was spread by a Twitter account called @2020fight, a new account with tens of thousands of followers that specialized in incendiary but ideologically inconsistent political content and was attributed to a “teacher” from California, despite using the photograph of a blogger from Brazil.Twitter suspended the account on Tuesday. While there are currently no solid indications of who was behind the account, said Clint Watts, a research fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, the account’s tactics and patterns are reminiscent of the 2016 social media election tampering campaign.“It still shows the power of inauthentic social media manipulation,” said Watts. “It’s iding us. It doesn’t bode well for 2020.”Bernice King, daughter of the civil rights icon, was among the Twitter users to post the viral video.“We are not a post-racial or post-racism nation,” she wrote. “Courageous people, like this Native elder, face overt racism and racist ideologies and systems each and every day. This is ugly, America. Truth, education and corrective action matter.”“America has cowered in the drudgery of racism and bigotry for 400+ years,” she continued.“Colonialism and white supremacy have violently shaped systems, including education, across the globe. What we teach NOW matters. Our children are influenced by the hate OR the love we give. Choices.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fef2eff24f487bde31a733cb2aa260ed0b4014f4/57_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efed841b8efc959af15b8bc000793de0","title":"how conservative media transformed the covington catholic students from pariahs to heroes","story":"Conservatives have realized they can construct a parallel reality and have it acceptedIn just four days, teenager Nick Sandmann and his fellow students at Covington Catholic high school have gone from social media pariahs to conservative heroes.On Tuesday night, Fox News hosts continued to feast on the controversy, which was sparked by a standoff between Covington Catholic high school students and a Native American veteran called Nathan Phillips. Footage show students wearing pro-Trump Maga hats taunting the Omaha tribe elder. The relentlessly repeated talking point — that there was a collective “rush to judgement” on the boys because they were Trump supporters — was used by conservative anchors Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Laura Ingraham to attack mainstream media and left leaning social media users.On Wednesday morning, Sandmann got almost nine minutes of airtime on a national breakfast program to make his case, after his family hired a Republican-linked PR firm. In making this happen, conservative media have normalized the boys’ aggressive form of political expression, and tried to further discredit both fact-oriented media and high-profile liberals. Media outlets have been effectively gaslighted, and many climbed down from coverage which was based on the most clear and obvious interpretation of the boys chanting, making gestures and making tomahawk chops. What it tells us is that in 2019, conservatives understand they can construct a parallel reality and have it accepted. They can act in bad faith and prevail, using tried and tested tactics that liberal media continue to fall for. Those are:One thing that rightwing media understands much better than their liberal counterparts is that the ubiquity of recording devices at any current protest tends to shatter the public record into dozens of pieces.A particular version of events based on early footage can always be called into question, and another version put forward as definitive, as more footage, and alternative edits of footage emerge. Partisans can pick and choose, knowing that a definitive version of what happened may not emerge before the news cycle has moved on.Just as importantly, additional footage allows the discussion to be reframed. Instead of asking why a group of schoolboys were protesting wearing hats that many in the community view as a symbol of racism, conservatives quickly turned it into a game of who approached whom, and began discussing the teenagers as if they were literal martyrs.The most influential revisionist account of the confrontation to emerge was written by Reason’s Robbie Soave. In a commentary on the two-hour version of the original video (which readers were unlikely to watch in full), where Soave reframed the discussion to include the actions of a group unrelated either to the students or to Native protesters, and claimed that there had been no wrongdoing on the part of the students. Conservatives picked this ball up and ran with it as far as they could.So far, conservative media has been unified and resolute in hammering the narrative that Nathan Philips, a Native American veteran, somehow provoked the boys by coming between them and a small group of Black Hebrew Israelites, to whose insults they had responded to with chants.No amount of additional footage showing their Maga-yelling rowdy behavior and sexist comments before the event – not even clear and concise edits showing how aggressive and provocative the teens were and how calm Phillips was – is capable of knocking them off this course.If you want a lesson in how this kind of persistence works, look at the coverage from Gateway Pundit since Saturday. Very early on, Jim Hoft recognized the symbolic value of the confrontation, doggedly pushed his own, partial interpretation of events, smeared everyone on the other side, and then brought the entirety of conservative media with him. (Earlier, even some conservative outlets had been critical of the boys). His reward was seeing that version of events trumpeted by Tucker Carlson on Monday night, who also launched a broadside at any conservatives who had wavered from exonerating the teens.That night, and Tuesday, Carlson’s fellow Fox News hosts were singing from the same songsheet. And if Fox News presents a unified message, the President frequently echoes it.Another tactic conservative media uses is to only consider the most appalling versions of opposing arguments, and to focus their audience’s anger on reliable scapegoats.To avoid confronting reasonable arguments or new evidence, conservatives emphasize the worst of the other side – like tweets calling for violence or doxxing. Tweets calling for violence or doxxing against high school students are obviously and clearly unacceptable, but nor are they typical of the criticisms made of the boys, their school, and their conduct. They also focus the audience on liberal journalists and celebrities – mostly women – who their audience’s feel comfortable in deriding and dismissing.As of Wednesday, as a result of these well-work tactics, liberal media has almost completely backed away from their initial, justified take on the story.

A further 75 were removed on Wednesday, with the remaining 430 to be evicted before the centre’s closure on 31 January.The evictions follow the approval of the “Salvini decree”, named after Matteo Salvini, the interior minister and leader of the far-right League, in late November.Salvini claimed the centre, which has hosted about 8,000 people over the last eight years, was a den for “drug-dealing and crime” and that the same fate would soon befall the 2,000 people living in the sprawling Cara di Mineo reception centre in in Sicily and at similar structures across Italy.He said the closures would save the Italian government €6m (£5.2m) a year, money that would instead be spent “helping Italians”. “I did what any good father would have done,” he said.Riccardo Travaglini, the mayor of Castelnuovo di Porto, told reporters that no notice was given before the evictions. Men, women and children, many enrolled in local schools, were reportedly separated before the majority were taken by bus to undisclosed destinations. Some were housed by local residents, including Travaglini, who took in a woman from Somalia and her child.“In a single day, they managed to destroy years of work,” Traviglini said. “These were people who had managed to become integrated.”Travaglini protested alongside staff working at the centre and local priests, while Rossella Muroni, a politician with the small leftwing party Free and Equal, attempted to block one of the buses. Parliamentarians with the opposition Democratic party were heavily critical of the move.The party’s Roberto Morassut compared the evictions to “deportations to Nazi concentration camps”. “One of the most important structures for immigrant reception was evacuated without adequate warning … it was a real blitz,” he said.Salvini has said those who “have rights” will not be left stranded and will instead be relocated to other “beautiful structures”. “They will have the right to board and lodging,” he said. “But for the rest we will begin the deportation process.”The evictions came as Germany announced it was pulling out of the EU’s Operation Sophia, a naval mission targeting human trafficking in the Mediterranean, due to Italy’s refusal to allow migrants to disembark at its ports.The majority of residents at the Castelnuovo di Porto centre were in the process of applying for asylum. Many had received humanitarian protection, a two-year permit granted to those who are not eligible for refugee status but who for various reasons cannot be sent home. Humanitarian protection status, which enables people to work and is estimated to be held by about 100,000 people, was abolished under Salvini’s bill.“Salvini’s decree will only amplify social problems,” said Valeria Carlini, a spokesperson for the Italian Council for Refugees. “The law is forcing those who already have humanitarian protection into the social margins … instead of having the chance to work, they will end up homeless.”Unions have also protested over the thousands of jobs that will be lost as a result of the refugee centre closures.“The reality is that there more Italians will be jobless,” said Carlini. “Organisations involved in migrant integration are often accused of being in a ‘lucrative business’. It’s not like that at all, Salvini’s decree will bring many organisations to their knees.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Retired surgeon (86) on trial accused of 13 charges of indecent assault in DroghedaTalks continue at Workplace Relations Commission to try and avert industrial actionPublic consultation opens on latest instalment of disputed plan for Dublin\u0026rsquos bus serviceCentre in Dublin docklands \u0026lsquowill upgrade one of the most prominent locations in the city\u0026rsquo, local authority planner saidCircuit Court President says case \u0026lsquoa try on\u0026rsquo which took much work to set up but failedDublin Fire Brigade clears smoke from building with pressure ventilating fansHurley family not told of any issues around daughter\u0026rsquos birth and took case after seeing news reportsDecision ends inequity whereby access was restricted to CervicalCheck patientsNo capital projects stopped because of overruns but some may be \u0026lsquodeferred\u0026rsquo - VaradkarBrendan Doolin (36) accused of 18-month campaign against journalists and writersCourt told Milan Nasryon (11) suffered from anxiety and now fears dogs after incidentPatrick Quirke (50) goes on trial for murder of DJ who started relationship with woman he had affair withFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader claims Harris offered rechecks against expert adviceThe Irish charity worker (60) was found stabbed to death in Cape Town last NovemberOther participants including Simon Coveney flew economy which was 10 times cheaperRT\u0026Eacute\u0026rsquos Michael Creed interview has echoes of infamous Paxman grilling of HowardDublin City Council sought possession of property for breach of tenancy agreementCost of St James\u0026rsquos project, now expected to be \u0026euro1.7bn, was originally set at \u0026euro600m"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3767766.1548240371!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"prospect of border checks in france and netherlands downplayed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar is to meet all party leaders in the Dáil on a fortnightly basis to maintain political consensus on the approach to Brexit. File photograph: Tom HonanSources at Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s briefing of Opposition leaders on Tuesday night downplayed the prospect of border checks in France and the Netherlands that could affect Irish trade in the case of a no deal Brexit. While Mr Varadkar did mention the prospect of such checks, a number of those present said it was a remark made in passing. It was not, said one source, as if Mr Varadkar referenced checks in Calais and the Rotterdam as a concrete plan being proposed by the European Commission. The general mood of of the meeting, it was added, was a “strong consensus” that the “deal on the backstop should be pursued” and that the Government should “give no ground” on the backstop. Mr Varadkar is to meet all party leaders in the Dáil on a fortnightly basis to maintain political consensus on the approach to Brexit. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald confirmed Mr Varadkar did not suggest an EU single market border could be in France or the Netherlands rather than Ireland.Asked on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland if such a proposition was “a runner”, Ms McDonald said: “This is absolutely not a runner, I have to say that was not forwarded as a proposition by Leo Varadkar or by anybody else as the objective here.”Asked if Mr Varadkar had not set up the notion of a border in Calais or Rotterdam as “a proposition or a desirable outcome”, Ms McDonald said: “He didn’t set that up as a proposition or a desirable outcome.“I have emphasised to the Taoiseach time out of number that the task now for him and his government is to hold their nerve.“We need very steady heads, whatever pressure, whatever overtures that comes from London or anywhere else, the backstop has been negotiated. It’s not perfect. “Brexit is still bad news and I say that as somebody who is very critical of the European Union, but let me tell you whatever criticism of the European project, Brexit for this country was never the answer.”Ms McDonald told Morning Ireland that European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas was right when he said there would need to be a hard border in Ireland in the event of a no deal Brexit.That was why the backstop was so important, as it mitigated the effect of Brexit in the event of the UK “crashing out” with no agreement, she said.The Government has the responsibility to start preparing for that eventuality, she said.The first job is to look for “breathing room” for Irish businesses, for society in general and for peace structures.Later, Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed said the Government is not countenancing a border infrastructure on the island of Ireland, “in any shape or form”, in the context of Brexit preparations.He said that any reimposition of checks and border infrastructure would run the “high risk” of leading the country back into a situation where we would revisit the troubles.Meanwhile, the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said a temporary safeguard to avoid erecting a physical border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit would serve no purpose.In an interview published in the newspapers Le Monde, Rzeczpospolita and Luxemburger Wort on Wednesday, Mr Barnier said the current backstop proposal over the border was the only option on the table. “The question of limiting the backstop in time has already been discussed twice by European leaders. This is the only possible option because an insurance is of no use if it is time limited,” Mr Barnier said.European Union Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said on Wednesday the risk of a no deal Brexit had increased in last few weeks and it was up to the British to tell the EU what they wanted.With Britain due to leave the bloc on March 29th, Mr Moscovici told Reuters at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the EU was ready and waiting, and nobody wanted a no deal outcome. - Additional reporting Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3767993.1548257236!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"six more routes unveiled for busconnects proposal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn several areas under review the plan will require front gardens and other properties to facilitate road widening.

Thousands of people cross the Border daily and goods and services pass between the two jurisdictions without restriction.Mr Barnier did not say what would happen if the Government refused such border checks.“My team and I have done a lot of work on virtual, decentralised controls, which will be useful in all hypotheses,” he continued, seeming to hint at digital checks by a computer that links licence plate numbers to a customs declaration that is filed in advance online, as envisioned at the port of Calais.“Even in the absence of an agreement, we will do our utmost not to create a hard border in Ireland,” he added.Mr Barnier said that a backstop limited to five years, as proposed by the Polish foreign minister, would not be possible.“It is Brexit that imposes the backstop we are talking about today,” said Mr Barnier. “And it is what the UK chose. We proposed a more simple one (in which only Northern Ireland would remain in the single market), but London refused that solution and proposed its own (under which the entire UK would remain in the customs union).”Mr Barnier said he was open to all proposals, including Irish and Polish, since there are 900,000 Poles living in the UK. “But the question of limiting the backstop in time was discussed twice, in November and December 2018. This backstop is the only one possible, because an assurance is no longer operational when it is limited in time.”Mr Barnier was asked if he could be receptive to British prime minister Theresa May’s request for concessions on the backstop. “This security net is part of the withdrawal treaty,” he replied. “It is a guarantee for the preservation of peace and stability on the island of Ireland, the guarantee that in all hypotheses we will not rebuild a hard border, that we will preserve the Good Friday Agreement and the Common Travel Area.”Mr Barnier said his meetings in Northern Ireland made him realise how sensitive the issue is and how fragile the peace.“When I visited Dungannon in May 2018, I was very struck by my meeting with a group of women,” he said. “Two of them wept because they were so afraid that the Troubles would start again.”Mr Barnier said the backstop concerns all of Europe. “Because of the freedom of movement within the European internal market, a product that enters Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK is the same as if it entered Poland or France. We have an obligation to control it. It must conform with the standards of the internal market.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The New York Times were on the ground in Paris with the “Yellow Vests” protesters as they took to the streets for the fourth week in a row. Video: NYT\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProtesters wearing Pikachu hats take part in a Women’s Gilets Jaunes protest in front of the Eiffel Tower on January 20th. Photograph: Ian LangsdonEPAThough it started as a protest over fuel taxes, the still simmering ‘Gilets Jaunes’ revolt in France quickly morphed into anger over income inequality and social injustice.Yet paradoxically, the French government is one of the world’s leading redistributors of wealth and social injustice is less than in other developed countries.Le Point magazine and Le Parisien newspaper have in recent days published in-depth dossiers on the question. They cited studies by the French statistical institute Insee and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which found that income inequality is relatively low in France. And there is less poverty in France than elsewhere in the EU.Economists measure income inequality by the Gini coefficient, where zero would mean complete equality. France’s Gini coefficient of 0.289 compares favourably with inequality in the UK (0.351) and the US (0.391). Contrary to popular perception, inequality is not increasing, but stagnating, in France. And it is dramatically lower than 50 to 100 years ago.Likewise, statistics show that purchasing power too has stagnated, not decreased, over the past decade, except for brief periods in 2012 and 2013. However, Insee admits, the cost of basic necessities has risen, especially for the poorest, which sometimes gives the impression the statistics are lying.Only the wealthiest 43.14 per cent of French households pay income tax, and France has the highest rate of payroll deductions in the world. Yet “make the rich pay” is a constant cry of the ‘Gilets Jaunes’.Insee reported in October that the richest 10 per cent of the French paid 70 per cent of all income tax collected in 2017, or €55 billion out of €78 billion.Before income redistribution, the average income of the 20 per cent of wealthiest households was 8.4 times the average income of the poorest 20 per cent.After redistribution, the richest were only 3.9 times better off than the poorest, Insee reported. Government payments, including housing subsidies and social welfare, accounted for two-thirds of the reduction in inequality, while income tax accounted for the other third.However, the \u0026nbspFrench are less socially mobile and less equal in opportunity than citizens of other developed countries. It takes six generations for the offspring of a poor French family to reach median income, compared to four to five generations in other OECD countries. \u0026nbspIn 2017, France ranked eighth among 28 EU countries, with 14 per cent of the population, or 8.8 million people, living in poverty, according to a chart published by Le Parisien. Ireland ranked 11th, with 15.6 per cent in poverty, while Germany was 15th, with 16.1 per cent, and the UK was 17th, with 17 per cent.The French far right and far left claim that ordinary French people are victims of “ultra liberal” government policies that have led the state to disengage from the economy.In fact, Le Point reports, “The weight of the state has never been greater in the economic life of the country.” Over the past 30 years, public spending has tripled, from the equivalent of €416 billion in 1987 to €1,294 billion in 2017. As a percentage of GDP, government spending has risen from 50 to 57 per cent of GDP, the highest in the OECD and, according to some sources, the highest in the world.Social protection has risen from 24.5 per cent of French GDP in 1959 to 32 per cent – also the highest in the OECD – in 2016. Between 1980 and 2017, the number of civil servants rose from 3.86 million to 5.66 million.When President Emmanuel Macron addressed his compatriots in a letter announcing a national debate earlier this month, he said, “France is not like other countries. The sense of injustice is more intense than elsewhere. The demand for mutual assistance and solidarity is greater.”One can only speculate why a generous welfare state has engendered the most persistent anti-government protests in Europe. The different attitude cited by Macron, coupled with a revolutionary tradition, has something to do with it. Fears that Macron’s reforms would alter the system also played a part. As the 19th century philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville observed, the most dangerous moment for a government is usually when it begins to reform."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

The real problem is that we have too many families who cannot cook. So the easiest thing is to buy takeaways or ready meals and sit around the television and eat.“Families should make an effort to have the TV off around meal time and have a conversation while eating. It slows the speed of eating and means you wolf down fewer calories.”Dr Max Davie, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said:  “There is some evidence to suggest that watching screens can distract children from feeling full. What’s more, we know that children are often exposed to adverts for unhealthy food and drink whilst watching their favourite TV shows, which in turn can lead to higher calorie intake.Our screen time guidance recommends that parents and their children build screen time around positive family activities – such as sharing meals together. But with one in three children leaving primary school overweight or obese, it is clear that action is needed at a national level to tackle the childhood obesity problem. That’s why we want to see Government publish their consultation on restricting junk food marketing before the 9pm watershed on TV, with similar restrictions online, without delay, he said. The chief medical officer said she had embraced the label of “chief nanny” after years of being described as such.“It\u0027s good to be the chief nanny if it has an impact,” Dame Sally told the event, reiterating calls for extra taxes on sugary and salty snacks.“I am wearing my label with pride,” she said. However, she questioned whether a male chief medical officer would have attracted the same nickname, saying the issue “raised questions” about sexism.Advice or admonition | Dame Sally\u0026#039s previous warnings“We won\u0027t go there,” she continued. “Just make the changes and chief nanny will be happy.”And she urged politicians to listen to her calls to extend the sugar levy, extending taxes so they were placed on chocolates, sweets, and cakes as well as on milky drinks.“We need political will. If you look at outcomes think how many lives were saved by seat belts,” she said.“Think how many lives were saved by the smoking ban in public places. Think how many lives  could be saved by extending the sugar levy. Politicians do need to listen to me - and I keep telling them this,” she said.Comment: Is Jacob Rees-Mogg starting to panic that \u0026#39Europhile kamikaze MPs\u0026#39 could box him in?Speedboat killer Jack Shepherd arrested in former Soviet state of Georgia after handing himself inTrump-supporting teen in viral video says \u0026#39I wish I\u0026#39d walked away\u0026#39 from Native AmericanKnife crime epidemic on Britain\u0026#39s railways as police respond to three incidents a dayCelebrities feared supporting Heads Together due to fear of mental health stigma, Prince William saysTorquay shakes off its Basil Fawlty image as TripAdvisor names B\u0026ampB in English Riviera the best in the worldComment: This Tory MP has hit on a plan to save Brexit.

Sullivan, have been retained by Harvey Weinstein, Mr Baez told The  in a statement. Mr Weinstein steadfastly maintains his innocence in this matter and we are looking forward to assisting Mr Weinstein in his defence.”Ms Mackey represented Kobe Bryant when he was accused of raping a 19-year-old hotel employee in 2013 in Colorado.

We are with you.Maduro responded by accusing the US, through Pence, of trying to engineer a coup.Venezuela\u0027s government ominously predicted there would be violence against opposition protesters, although claiming it would be self-inflicted in a bid to portray the regime as brutal.Venezuela\u0027s Communications Minister Jorge Rodriguez even said Monday\u0027s mutiny, in which soldiers took over a command post in the north of Caracas and called on the public to head to the streets in repudiation of Maduro, was merely a ruse to steal weapons.An anti-government demonstrator throws a Molotov cocktail during clashes with police and troops in the surroundings of a National Guard command post in CotizaUS Senator Marco Rubio warned of manipulation by Venezuela\u0027s intelligence service, urging them to reconsider the plan they have for tomorrow before it\u0027s too late.Monday\u0027s mutiny was quickly put down. Twenty-seven soldiers were arrested and Rodriguez claimed they confessed to handing out weapons to opposition activists so they can carry out acts of violence, (cause) injuries and deaths during the protest.The mutiny sparked at least 30 small protests in different parts of Caracas, according to a non-governmental organization monitoring social conflict. Police used tear gas against some of the demonstrators. Juan Guaido speaks before a crowd of opposition supporters during an open meeting at the Central University of CaracasWe leave the violence to others, Mr Guaido said.Tomorrow is about reuniting as a people to tell the world about the steps we\u0027re going to take to end the usurpation, to achieve a transitional government and a free election.Speedboat killer Jack Shepherd arrested in former Soviet state of Georgia after handing himself inTrump-supporting teen in viral video says \u0026#39I wish I\u0026#39d walked away\u0026#39 from Native AmericanKnife crime epidemic on Britain\u0026#39s railways as police respond to three incidents a dayCelebrities feared supporting Heads Together due to fear of mental health stigma, Prince William saysTorquay shakes off its Basil Fawlty image as TripAdvisor names B\u0026ampB in English Riviera the best in the worldComment: This Tory MP has hit on a plan to save Brexit.

But repeated rumours have suggested that Apple was in fact working to get AirPower out much earlier, but that technical issues had got in the way of making it available to the public.Those reports chime with similar claims earlier this month that AirPower was on its way and was making its way through Apple\u0027s supply chain. The beginning of production comes after Apple solved the technical issues – thought to be problems with overheating and other challenges – according to numerous reports.When Apple revealed AirPower in September 2017, promising it would be available soon, it showed a rounded charging mat that would allow people to charge phones and Apple Watches alongside AirPods in a special new case. But there has been no sign of the new product – with major events like the release of the iPhone XS and XR passing without a mention.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The behaviour of big companies shows they think otherwiseClick to followThe IndependentLiam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, has been issuing warnings about the danger of delaying Brexit on the BBC again\u0026nbspwhen he’s actually supposed to be in Davos banging the drum for trade deals that have proved something of a challenge to get moving.\u0026nbspPart of the reason for his making a noise is perhaps because the timing of the trip could hardly have been worse. It came a day after arch Brexiteer Sir James Dyson unveiled plans to ship the gizmo maker’s corporate HQ to Singapore. The company claimed this had nothing to do with Brexit. That was approached with some scepticism.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, P\u0026ampO replaced the British flag with that of Cyprus for its ships’ registration bringing an end to nearly two centuries of history, Sony confirmed plans to move its European HQ from London to Amsterdam, Pets at Home and Dixons Carphone outlined stockpiling measures to protect them from the kicking Mr Fox and his chums seem bent on delivering. \u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialLiam Fox claims no-deal Brexit would not be \u0027national suicide\u0027Chance of Brexit down to ‘50-50’ if MPs vote down PM\u0027s deal, says FoxThe trade generalissimo’s Davos press notice nonetheless contained some fancy figures about the UK’s past attractiveness as a destination for foreign direct investment, from Deloitte and the UN.\u0026nbspOf course, the UK was in the EU when those investments were made. And these sort of figures are very dependent on the methodology used by which organisation is putting them together. A report from the OECD on the same subject revealed FDI fell sharply between 2016 and 2017. The release didn’t mention that. But as one Tory MP said of Fox: “He has never been very good at detail.Still, that didn’t stop him from stamping his little feet. Parliament’s attempt to take control of Brexit,\u0026nbsp and the possible delay as a result, would be a worse than no deal, he declared.\u0026nbspCorporate Britain has been saying otherwise for some time now, and lately it has started voting with its feet.As yet, the moves are mostly technical, although it’s notable that drugs group AstraZeneca has suspended investment and none of our big car makers seem minded to put any new money in given the threat no deal poses to their supply chains.\u0026nbspThere have already been some Brexit job losses, and Fox bears a share of the responsibility for them. But they have rather resembled the trailers you see before big Hollywood disaster movies.When the main feature starts, Fox will presumably bluster some more. That will come as slim comfort for those affected, but expecting anything better from this ministerial code breaker (that should be repeated every time he opens his mouth with the thinly veiled Brexit threats he’s been making) is probably a bit too much to ask for.\u0026nbspLet’s face it, this is the man who claimed doing a deal with the EU would be the “easiest thing in human history” during the EU\u0026nbspreferendum campaign.\u0026nbspHe also promised that the government would agree 40 free trade deals with other non-EU countries\u0026nbspthe minute Britain left the EU too.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

And as evidenced by their dominance of the market these contracts clearly represent a convenient method of paying for a car, even for households who are otherwise adding to savings. Their growth is not evidence that people are outspending their income in aggregate.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Student debt: are you on top of what you owe?

Further, he noted that interest rates were not expected to rise sharply to pre-crisis levels.“This makes it slightly puzzling to read (as one often does) that household debt is ‘unsustainably’ high. This view is ubiquitous. My suspicion is that, at least in some cases, people come to it because they have in the back of their minds an alternative and rather attractive world in which we all have fewer debts but the same assets,” he said.Mr Broadbent also pointed to analysis suggesting that historically the growth of household debt is more important than the level when it comes to creating the conditions for a crisis.“That doesn’t mean the level of debt doesn’t matter. But it may matter only relative to some sustainable threshold, one that’s not directly observable and that can vary,” he said.“The precise terms, and therefore the riskiness of a given quantity of debt, are not exactly the same in every country.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The group has opened two pubs and sold six since the beginning of the financial year, with plans to open between five and 10 this year. Wetherspoons warns of price rises as boss repeats call for hard BrexitWetherspoons bans dogs from all their UK pubs as of todayWill Wetherspoons really only sell British booze post-Brexit?Wetherspoon to replace champagne with British sparkling winesEd Monk, associate director at Fidelity Personal Investing, said: “There was more Brexit bluster from J D Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin in the company’s trading update today, but investors will be more focused on the warning that pre-tax profit will be lower in the first half of the trading year. “The margins at ’Spoons are tight so the challenge has been to grow overall sales in order to keep growing profits. Any hint of higher costs, including staff wages, is bad news so the news of another £30m in labour costs since November will hurt. With unemployment low, thanks in part to lower flows of workers from the EU, labour costs will continue to be a focus at Wetherspoon.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Boring Company has developed technologies to recycle the earth into useful bricks to be used to build structures.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And as evidenced by their dominance of the market these contracts clearly represent a convenient method of paying for a car, even for households who are otherwise adding to savings. Their growth is not evidence that people are outspending their income in aggregate.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Student debt: are you on top of what you owe?

Further, he noted that interest rates were not expected to rise sharply to pre-crisis levels.“This makes it slightly puzzling to read (as one often does) that household debt is ‘unsustainably’ high. This view is ubiquitous. My suspicion is that, at least in some cases, people come to it because they have in the back of their minds an alternative and rather attractive world in which we all have fewer debts but the same assets,” he said.Mr Broadbent also pointed to analysis suggesting that historically the growth of household debt is more important than the level when it comes to creating the conditions for a crisis.“That doesn’t mean the level of debt doesn’t matter. But it may matter only relative to some sustainable threshold, one that’s not directly observable and that can vary,” he said.“The precise terms, and therefore the riskiness of a given quantity of debt, are not exactly the same in every country.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Anger over poor social conditions grew so intense that it provoked a riot in the late 1990s. A local social activist who objected to youths smashing bottles on the road and handed a bin bag full of broken glass to the mother of one of those responsible\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbsphe had bricks thrown at his house and firecrackers pushed through the letterbox.Outside Westminster, people are becoming numb to the Brexit crisisWhat turned Thanington round was substantial aid from the European Union.Paul Todd, a former resident who works on housing and homelessness issues, says:\u0026nbsp“About 20 years ago it was regenerated when it got a large dose of money out of the European regeneration budget.” The funding was used to make extensive renovations such as putting new roofs on the council houses and renewing bathrooms and bedrooms so the homes of council tenants looked better than those privately owned. In addition, the\u0026nbspregeneration money funded a community centre, known locally as the Resource Centre, which provides space for sports and recreation, as well as accommodation for children doing homework which they could not do at home.Paula Spencer, who has managed the centre since it was built, adds that the EU “spent £2.5m in doing up the estate and getting rid of the rat-runs. It used to be that they would nick your video machine and disappear down an alleyway.” Crime and antisocial behaviour dropped by 50 per cent as the regeneration measures took effect. As a newly arrived council tenant, Heggie says that she had been worried by the crossbow bolt incident but “apart from one broken car window on my driveway I have had no trouble since”.Created with Sketch.

A police officer speaks with anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayPolice surround a pro-Brexit protester after he confronted a pro-European protester Conservative MP David Davies, wearing a gopro camera, speaks to anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayThe EU intervention enabled Thanington – which I previously featured in the first instalment of this series – to lose its nickname of “Little Beirut”, but its residents complain that they have lacked public investment ever since, and that this is beginning to show. The 2,794 people who live there work mostly in low-wage jobs, often as cleaners or in supermarkets in and around Canterbury, or they are on benefits. Educational standards are low, illiteracy is high, and many single-parent families are headed by women. Nevertheless, residents and outside observers agree that Thanington retains a strong sense of communal solidarity.“It’s largely retained its village identity,” says Todd, whose relatives still live there and who has great affection for its people. “Everyone knows everyone else’s business.”\u0026nbspOver the past summer, we had a lot of guys coming down from London and selling drugs. They’d move into a house, take it over and intimidate the tenant. Then there was the shootingThe only state institution to help preserve this small and vulnerable community was the EU, so it is worth asking why so many of those living in Thanington voted Leave\u0026nbspin the 2016 referendum. At first glance, their actions, repeated in many deprived areas receiving EU funds in England and Wales, appear to be an inexplicable example of social and economic self-harm. Nevertheless, it was probably the high Leave\u0026nbspvotes in deprived white housing estates which tipped the balance towards Britain voting for Brexit. So it is important to discover why people from such places voted as they did in such overwhelming numbers. Was it a vote very much determined by opposition to immigration, or was it a more general protest by the “left-behinds”\u0026nbspand the “left-outs”? \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMost people in Thanington voted for Britain to leave the EU, and they did so because they are poor and feel neglected, according to Todd, who has known the area for 30 years. He says that there is an “assumption there that immigration has affected their prospects. I don’t think people are aware of how much Thanington did benefit from the EU. The European regeneration money certainly made a huge impact on the quality of the housing stock up there. It probably gave some of the houses another chance, otherwise they might have been knocked down. Some people want immigration cut and others think that talk of another referendum is an indicator that their concerns haven’t been taken seriously.”Bellas did not mention and may not have known about the EU regeneration effort which happened before he started living on the estate after years of homelessness and holding insecure jobs. In any case, the impact of that funding is running out and there are signs of growing decrepitude and insecurity.\u0026nbsp“It’s quite a deprived area,” he says. “There’s a lot of people with drug problems and\u0026nbspalcohol issues, and they seem to be moving families in who have already been evicted from homes because of antisocial behaviour. Everyone’s got a right to live anywhere but it doesn’t do great things for the estate.“Over the past summer, we had a lot of guys coming down from London and selling drugs. They’d move into a house, take it over and intimidate the tenant – ‘you’re going to sell this for us’\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa lot of guys in Mercedes,\u0026nbspreal high-end saloons,\u0026nbspwho don’t fit on the estate. Then there was the shooting in the summer, which was a direct result of these guys coming down from London and that happened just around the corner from us.”Created with Sketch.

Only the sleeping bag is left as a sign of what might have been“It’s a lack of funding and a lack of police. You only ever see police when these things happen and it’s after the fact. Our kids don’t play out on the street. I know all my neighbours and I know all their kids, but it’s really difficult because there are people from off the estate come to sell their drugs that I don’t know. We had a heroin dealer set up in the house next door to us and for about six weeks, we had people knocking on our door coming to pick up their drugs up and it took 50 phone calls to the police to get them to sort it out.”The shooting Bellas refers to took place on 19 July last year when\u0026nbsptwo men in balaclavas shot and seriously wounded Danny Mobey in Thanington’s Godwin Road.Bellas voted Leave in the referendum, denying that this had anything to do with immigration and saying that his decision was more to do with democracy and resistance to power being devolved to a centralised European government and unelected officials making decisions on his behalf. He says: “I just feel that there is something quite sinister and secret about a federal government.”About the economic consequences of departure from the EU, he is optimistic, arguing that the Germans, French and Spanish will want to go on selling goods to Britain. He says that a lot of people he knows had voted Leave influenced by “the Brexiteers’ promise that there would be £350m\u0026nbspextra for the NHS”.\u0026nbspHis two biggest concerns are the lack of policing and the decline of the NHS, where his wife works as a nurse, and which he fears the government wants to privatise.Even in a place as small as Thanington, perceptions of violence vary markedly from street to street and person to person. Di Hutchinson agrees that things are getting worse: “I was ill last Christmas and I saw a drug deal going down and I was shocked because it was the first time I’d ever seen it.” Overall, however, residents and outside observers say that Thanington is no worse than other housing estates and other areas of deprivation anywhere in UK. (There are more affluent parts of the district away from the estate.)People came to me and said that there were rats in their kitchens, rats in their children’s bedrooms, running over kids’ feet, and under bathrooms so there was raw sewage seeping everywhereFinancial aid from the EU and other advantages stemming from membership had little effect on poor Leave voters in 2016. Either the EU’s achievements were under-publicised, or – and this is probably the crucial factor – whatever the EU did was not enough to counterbalance a pervasive sense among millions of voters that their lives are getting more pressured and insecure. This was as true in east Kent as it was in Cornwall, an example of ingratitude for EU largesse often cited. That county has a population of 530,000 and received €654m\u0026nbsp(£574m) from the EU between 2007 and 2013. It was due to receive another €600m before 2020, yet 54.5 per cent voted Leave.Fear of immigration was probably the most important factor in the way people voted, but so too was the privatisation and outsourcing of utitlities and services, job insecurity, decline in real wages, high rents, deindustrialisation and a lack of cheap transport. The EU and its supporters can justly complain that Brussels is being unfairly scapegoated for failings that it has\u0026nbspnothing to do with, and which\u0026nbspshould be blamed rather on globalisation, privatisation and the austerity policies pursued by Conservative governments.Yet, even if the EU is not responsible, this does not mean that the deep discontent\u0026nbsprevealed by the referendum result is\u0026nbspnot real. Simply put, Brexit is a symptom as well as a cause of the crisis which has enveloped Britain and envenomed its politics. The ill-considered Remain slogan of 2016 – “Better Together” –\u0026nbspwas never going to resonate with those whose standard of living had stagnated or deteriorated over the past decade despite Britain being in the EU. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAusterity may have driven homelessness rise, minister admitsTransport is already scarce: according to Spencer, it takes two bus trips to get to the nearest doctor, while there is only one bus every two hours in the evening. A planned new exit from the A2, which is being contested by local residents, will make Thanington even more isolated from the rest of Canterbury than it is at present. And as houses become more expensive and cost far more than the present population on their low-paying jobs can afford, the traditional community will break up as parents find that their children have to move off the estate if they want find anywhere cheap enough to live.Even more seriously, the insecure low-paid work done by many in Thanington does not provide enough to pay rent and food. The result is reliance on food banks and free school meals. Caroline Heggie says that people are becoming more and more indebted “because now you’ve got companies giving out credit cards to people with low credit ratings”.A telling sign of the growing deprivation in Thanington – and the sort of event which may explain why people there failed to endorse the status quo in 2016 – is a recent plague of rats.“People came to me and said that there were rats in their kitchens, rats in their children’s bedrooms, running over kids’ feet, and under bathrooms so there was raw sewage seeping everywhere,” says Spencer. The origin of the rat infestation is unclear: it may be that rats were disturbed by the new housing construction in nearby fields, or that the council no longer deals with rubbish that has been left to pile up. Cuts in public services of all kinds have hit Thanington hard, and services dropped include pest control.A rat catcher charges £60, which tenants must now pay themselves though there may be 10 or 12 rats to be disposed of, necessitating more than one visit.\u0026nbspHeggie says: “You used to have council ‘rat people’, but because of austerity, you don’t have them anymore.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance. The twist: He shows up to his date\u0027s house, knocks on the door... and comes face to face with The Vulture. He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with. The twist: Elijah is the biggest criminal of them all. When David shakes his hand at the end of the film, he sees that “Mr Glass” is the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks – including the train crash he survived.The set-up: Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) reveals a criminal plot concocted by the notorious Keyser Soze. He\u0027s eventually set free.The twist He made the whole thing up – Kint is Keyser Soze.The set-up: A mother’s rift with her parents is healed when she sends her two children, who they’ve never met, to stay with them when she goes on holiday. All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime StorySherlock Holmes: A Game of ShadowsIn the DarkClash of the Collectables: Season 1\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHave You Seen the Listers?\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBehind the Curve\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspDawn of the Planet of the ApesBlackadder: Series 1 and 2The Legend of Tarzan\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Story of Us with Morgan FreemanTwilight in Forks\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is why a stodgy literary biopic like The Life of Emile Zola somehow won the main award at the 1937 Oscars. It’s a solid and worthy piece of work, with a grandstanding performance from Paul Muni (under a lot of whiskers) as the campaigning French novelist. The idea, though, that it is one of the “few truly great pictures of all time”, as its own publicity suggested, is clearly idiotic.It may seem churlish to go after an underdog like Rocky but this was an undeserving Best Picture winner. The Academy voters in 1976 acted as if they were punch drunk and had spent too long in the ring with Apollo Creed. The problem with its victory wasn’t so much the film itself but with the other nominees that were spurned in its favour. Taxi Driver, All the President’s Men and Network all surely had a better claim to that year’s statuette.310 8. Around the World in 80 DaysThis was a perfectly amiable big-budget travelogue but you can’t help but suspect its Best Picture Oscar was more to do with the marketing and hustling skills of its producer, Mike Todd, than with any brilliance in the filmmaking. It was directed by the Englishman Michael Anderson, previously best known for The Dam Busters, and featured David Niven as the intrepid traveller, Phileas Fogg, who bets he can travel all the way round the world in a little over two months.Paul Haggis’s Crash is a decent and well-meaning study of the consequences of racism and violence in contemporary LA. It was independently made and had a large ensemble cast, all giving heartfelt performances. However, Robert Altman had covered similar territory better in Short Cuts and the feeling persisted that it had won the Best Picture award because some Academy voters were determined not to give the Oscar to the gay-themed contemporary western Brokeback Mountain.You rarely win an Oscar without a strong marketing campaign. The now disgraced distributorproducer Harvey Weinstein knew the secrets of getting Academy voters on his side better than anyone else in the business. Whether it was the Blitz-like approach to advertising in the trade press, or the timing of the awards screenings, or the way he kept the film’s stars in front of the media or his relentless courtship of the Academy members, he was arguably as important to the Oscar success of the so-so musical Chicago as any of the creative talent behind it.It’s not bad. It’s a love story that touches on mental illness and mathematics (neither usually subjects that Hollywood embraces). Russell Crowe gives a fine performance as John Nash, the Nobel prize-winning boffin with the beautiful but unstable mind. Nonetheless, Ron Howard’s biopic isn’t any kind of classic. It won its Best Picture Oscar in an unusually thin year.Marty, the 1955 winner, isn’t even the best version of its own subject matter. This story, scripted by the great Paddy Chayevsky, about an emotionally repressed Italian American butcher from the Bronx looking for love, had already been made as a live TV drama the year before. In the small-screen version, Rod Steiger gave a superlative performance in the lead role. Ernest Borgnine in the film version can’t help but seem like second best to anyone who saw Steiger in the same part. Whereas the puggish Borgnine makes Marty a figure of pity, Steiger turned him into a full blown tragic hero.810 3. Out of AfricaYou’ll remember the pink flamingos and all those scenes of beautiful Kenyan landscapes that looked as if they were cribbed from a David Attenborough natural history documentary. You won’t ever forget Meryl Streep’s eccentric accent as the Danish baroness and author, Karen Blixen (“I had a farm in Africa at the foot of the Ngong hills”). This is mushy stuff, though, and hardly deserving of its Oscar.This rousing, Scottish-set (but partly Irish-filmed) medieval epic is famous for its scenes of William Wallace’s army in blue faces lifting their kilts and baring their bums. Regardless of how accurate this was as history, it played into ongoing debates about devolution and Scottish independence. The film also did its bit for the Scottish tourism business. Mel Gibson knows how to stage a battle scene. Whether that qualifies his film for a Best Picture Oscar is another matter.1010 1. The Greatest Show on EarthFrom a vantage point 67 years on, the decision to give the Best Picture Oscar to Cecil B DeMille’s circus epic in 1952 is truly baffling. British viewers who have seen it will almost certainly have done so on TV (where its 152-minute running time made it useful for filling in gaps in the schedule). It has a decent cast and some reasonable stunts but Academy voters were surely clowning around when they chose it over other nominees in the same year which have aged far, far better like High Noon and The Quiet Man.110 10.

But is this true? Ben Chu\u0026nbspinvestigatesClick to followThe IndependentSome see WTO rules as a simple landing place post BrexitMany Brexiteers have claimed that one of the reasons we shouldn’t fear a no-deal departure\u0026nbspis that lots of\u0026nbspother countries in the\u0026nbspworld already trade\u0026nbspwith each other on basic World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules – the framework the UK would drop into if we left the EU on 29 March with no withdrawal agreement and no transition period.But is this claim actually true?Anand Menon, the director of the UK in a Changing Europe think tank, pointed out in an article for The Independent last month that it’s actually misleading.First it’s important to understand what the WTO is and what its rules are.There are 164 WTO member states around the world. The central rule of the club is that no country can impose tariffs on another country’s imports that are higher than those imposed on imports\u0026nbspfrom any other country\u0026nbsp– unless it has established a broad free trade agreement with that country. So if country X gives country Y a reduced tariff,\u0026nbspthat same favour must be granted to all other WTO members.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentThis is the “most favoured nation” principle. Its purpose is to prevent ad hoc discrimination on tariffs by countries and the risk of tit-for-tat trade battles.But that does not mean that, in the absence of a free trade agreement, trade between two states can be assumed to be governed only by WTO rules.Take the EU’s trade with the US.How badly could Brexit disrupt farming exports from Northern Ireland?“All 164 of them have negotiated better access to at least one market through some kind of bilateral agreement in addition to their WTO relationship.”So if the UK suddenly left the EU its trade with the US, at least initially, would still be disrupted because we would lose the coverage over those 100 sector agreements too.The point is that WTO rules are not some kind of tried and tested landing place for a country crashing out of a trade bloc.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Further delays followed in arranging for his travel to Britain, believed to be due to\u0026nbspthe French authorities, but it has now been confirmed that he will arrive on Monday 28 January.Hamish Arnott, his aunt’s solicitor at Bhatt Murphy, said: “This is welcome but long overdue, given that for two years he has had the right to come to the UK.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A couple walk through a park, in High Wycombe, as some areas of the UK see the first snow of the yearTtributes left outside Cardiff City Stadium after a plane carrying their new signing Emiliano Sala disappeared over the English Channel on Monday night.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk.

Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CH“We have to have some humility about what we can achieve in\u0026nbsp the private sector but if we can unlock it it’s amazing what you can pull off,” before issuing a warning: “If Africa fails, Europe cannot succeed.”Bono is a co-founder of One, which is a global campaign organisation with more than 10m members seeking to end extreme poverty.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The ‘no-deal’ even more so.”Following the defeat of her withdrawal agreement by the largest margin in the history of parliament, Ms May said she would try and secure a time-limit on the controversial backstop policy.But Mr Barnier said: “The question of limiting the backstop in time has already been discussed twice by the European leaders, in November and in December 2018.\u0026nbsp“This backstop is the only one possible because an assurance is no longer operational if it is for a limited time.

They are likely to back alternative motions that simply call for a public vote.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn has so far refused to agree to\u0026nbspMPs\u0027 and party members\u0027 demands that he\u0026nbspback a Final Say vote, but said the option should be considered by MPs.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbspThe prime minister is both refusing to change her red lines or take the threat of a no deal exit off the table.

If it comes before parliament as it is expected to in the next few daysweeks, I will instead vote for a better \u0027Labour\u0027 deal.This may mean that I am required to step down from my frontbench housing role if it is a whipped vote. I would be very disappointed if this were the case, as I am very proud of the work I have been doing alongside John Healey and Sarah Jones, but recognise that I cannot vote against the frontbench and remain a part of it.Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour\u0027s\u0026nbspshadow business secretary, said the amendment would simply\u0026nbspwiden the debate and put all options on the table to avoid a no-deal scenario but that the party\u0027s priority remained securning\u0026nbspa different Brexit deal, including a customs union with the EU and a closer relationship with the\u0026nbspsingle market.\u0026nbspAsked if\u0026nbspLabour\u0027s motion\u0026nbspmakes a second referendum\u0026nbspmore likely,\u0026nbspshe told Sky News: Well, no. In line with our conference policy...our priority is to secure a deal\u0026nbspbut obviously all options need to remain on the table and that includes a public vote.She added: There\u0027s no\u0026nbspguarantee that it will pass even if our amendment passed\u0026nbspand certainly right across the Conservative Party\u0026nbspand in the Labour Party there\u0027s ided opinion as to whether a second referendum should be a preferred option at this stage.Ms Long-Bailey\u0026nbspsuggested that, even if its amendment passes, Labour would not necessarily instruct its MPs to vote for another referendum, saying: That\u0027s something that the party would need to decide at the time.\u0026nbspWith parliament still deadlocked over Brexit, former Conservative leader William Hague said a fresh public vote was now quite likely.Writing in the Daily , he said: It will probably produce only a narrow victory for either side despite a long struggle, and leave a wounded country to limp on afterwards.But it\u0027s coming, unless some extraordinary turn of events prevents it. It\u0027s coming by a process of elimination, not because it\u0027s a good idea in itself.MPs will vote on 29 January on amendments to Ms May\u0027s proposed plan.Commons home affairs committee chair Yvette Cooper has tabled a motion that would delay Brexit until the end of the year if no deal is in place by the end of February. With significant cross-party support, the motion is likely to pass if Labour agrees to support it.Hilary Benn, chair of the Brexit commitee, has put down a separate amendment calling for MPs to hold a series of indicative votes on various Brexit outcomes.And Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, is expected to propose giving parliament to right to seize\u0026nbspcontrol of Brexit if the government cannot pass its deal.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He says he does not see no deal as the land of milk and honey - it very much holds risks.\u0026nbspI\u0027ve been very clear of the risks, he adds.\u0026nbspRejecting accusations the government is running down the clock\u0027 in the negotiations, Barclay says if the UK is unable to secure a deal, then the default scenario is a no-deal Brexit - which will also require legislation.On an urgent question on the failure of central courts IT system - after the story below appeared on Monday, detailing a major outage -\u0026nbspLucy Frazer, a minister in the Department for Justice, says she apologises to those who were affected by the failure.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShe says it was caused by infastructure issues with suppliers working for the Department.\u0026nbspWe know how frustrating this is for everyone, she adds.

She refuses to answer the question, instead focusing on Labour\u0027s own Brexit policy.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAsked again, May says her deal allows us to have an independent trade deals after Brexit - something a customs union does not allow.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTheresa May is now on her feet at prime minister\u0027s questions - in answer to one well placed question from a Conservative MP, she says the SNP are out of touch with the people of Scotland in demands for a fresh vote on independence.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCorbyn says after the overwhelming defeat of the Brexit deal, will the PM listen to her cabinet ministers and take no-deal off the table.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBut she says the way to prevent a no deal is by voting for her deal. May says Corbyn has been allowed to sit down with Hamas and IRA but no with her over Brexit.\u0026nbspThis is from the Press Association on Geoffrey Cox\u0027s appearance at the justice committee this morning.\u0026nbspThe release of legal advice to Cabinet on the Brexit deal last month should not be seen as a precedent for future guidance from Government law officers to be made public, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has warned.Mr Cox warned that the prospect of their advice being picked over by TV news channels would impact on the way law officers deliver their opinions on sensitive legal points to the Prime Minister.The Government agreed to publish Mr Cox\u0027s confidential advice on the controversial Brexit backstop after MPs found ministers in contempt of Parliament on December 4 for failing to comply with an earlier instruction to release it.The Attorney General told the Commons Justice Committee the move was an exceptional departure from the principle that law officers\u0027 advice is never revealed by the Government.Asked whether it should be seen as a precedent for future attempts by MPs to obtain confidential advice, he replied: No, I would argue not, because the principle is so vital to the conduct of good government, even more acutely so in circumstances of great public interest and controversy.Mr Cox warned: If every time the Attorney General now has to consider whether or not his advice is going to be put up on a 24-hour rolling news programme and pulled apart in a 45-second analysis - without the nuance, without the context, without the bits that weren\u0027t in bold, and only those bits in bold accentuated - he is going to have to consider how does he express himself in future.The Attorney General\u0027s advice, published on December 5, was seized on by Brexiteers because it confirmed the backstop arrangements required by the EU to keep the Irish border open could be indefinite.He told the cross-party committee: I published my advice on this occasion because of the very exceptional circumstances at that time.I took the view that it was vital that Parliament at this particular time should not go on feeling - as a majority plainly did - that it was being denied a useful assistance and that it was important we should be able to work with Parliament.I have the greatest respect for the House\u0027s judgments. It was a situation of acute regret for me personally that the House should have come to the conclusion that the Government was in contempt.I took the view that there was a public interest in the House\u0027s standing being upheld that, having reached a judgment that the Government was in contempt, in those circumstances the Government should comply.Mr Cox told the committee the convention that law officers\u0027 advice remains private is a crucial constitutional principle.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The group has opened two pubs and sold six since the beginning of the financial year, with plans to open between five and 10 this year.

Any hint of higher costs, including staff wages, is bad news so the news of another £30m in labour costs since November will hurt. With unemployment low, thanks in part to lower flows of workers from the EU, labour costs will continue to be a focus at Wetherspoon.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is a season for boldness and a focus on the future.”While he is the youngest candidate to have declared his run so far, he is not the only millennial in the pack: Hawaii representative Tulsi Gabbard is also 37.Mr Buttigieg points to his efforts in revitalising and ersifying the economy of South Bend, a Rust Belt town mired in post-industrial decline until he took office eight years ago, as evidence of his potential to implement the same policies on a national scale.Meet the Democrats running against Trump in 2020“We propelled our city’s comeback by taking our eyes off the rearview mirror, being honest about change and insisting on a better future,” he said.Born of Maltese and Scottish ancestry, Pete Buttgieg was an early achiever from a young age, winning the JFK Profiles in Courage Essay Contest in 2000 as a high school senior for his paper in praise of Vermont congressman Bernie Sanders, receiving his prize at the\u0026nbspJohn F\u0026nbspKennedy Presidential Library in Boston, Massachusetts, from the late president’s\u0026nbspdaughter, Caroline.Subsequently a Harvard graduate and a recepient of Oxford University’s prestigious Rhodes scholarship (also awarded to Bill Clinton) as well as the Joint Service Commendation Medal, Mr Buttigieg has already proved he can deliver votes in the heart of Trumpland, taking 80 per cent of the vote when he was re-elected in 2015.But his last attempt to step up from local politics ended in disappointment, when he failed to drum up sufficient support to win the chairmanship of the Democratic National Convention in 2017 despite impressing with his message on the need for the party to completely rebuild.“This president seems committed to talking to our enemies but seems to have a little more trouble talking to our friends. I’m not totally convinced that the United States has a foreign policy right now,” he said.“I’m having a hard time figuring out what we got in exchange for legitimising the North Korean regime. We’ve put an American flag next to a North Korean flag and basically treated a dictator like an equal.”He further demonstrated his way with a phrase when asked if he might run for the White House: “I think in 2020 we’re going to find out which of the rules of politics still apply and which ones have been broken forever. You know the president of the United States is basically a game show host.”Pete Buttigieg lives in South Bend with his husband Chasten Glezman and two rescue dogs: Truman and Buddy.\u0026nbspWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

month, it was announced that China may have reached a “historical turning point” after some estimates suggested deaths outstripped births in the Asian country last year for the first time since records began.In 2018, there were 15.23 million live births in China, a drop of two million from the year prior, according to official data.According to a recent survey by LinkedIn China and L’Oreal China, nearly 80 per cent of women born after 1995 choose to describe themselves as “economically independent”, compared to just over 20 per cent who ticked the traditional “loving wife and mother” option.In spite of the abolition of the government’s one-child policy in 2015, alarm bells have been raised that an ageing society and dwindling workforce could damage future prospects for economic growth.After decades in which the state aimed to restrict the number of children that parents gave birth to in order to control population, China is now looking at measures it can take to increase fertility.With life expectancy increasing, almost a quarter of the country’s population is expected to be over the age of 65 by 2040, a statistic that could prove problematic unless there is a large

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What a powerful statement.This school’s success is rooted in a couple of factors. It has a dedicated “study centre” open from am until pm.The centre was opened after the school realised that some of their students who live in busy or chaotic households don’t have access to a quiet study space.Role models are emphasised within the school, which has created a “university access team” featuring five full-time members of staff who are all Oxbridge graduates.Quite apart from the academic challenges — the privilege and elitism surrounding the world of Oxbridge is so intimidating that even the brightest kids coming from ordinary households could easily conclude that they wouldn’t belong.So the university access team also help them to see Oxbridge as an achievable goalThey take students to museums and find other ways to get them excited about study.Their sole aim is to support potential candidates, from  upwards, to get into good universities. I often say you can’t help where you start but you can decide where you end up.And this is a brilliant example.This kind of success comes down largely to self-belief.These children have been encouraged to visualise a very bright future for themselves, and to believe that they are worthy of it. And with that powering you, the sky really is the limit.Which is why the story about a young woman called Liv Conlon, from Bothwell near Glasgow, also caught my eye.Liv set up her first business at , importing goods from China and selling them online.She used the money she made from that to start another company, called The Property Stagers, which furnishes empty homes and, after years of bullying, decided to leave school at  to run it full time.Liv is now . The company furnishes more than  properties a year, and she’s hired a team of ten people – including her mother and brother.She’s also bought and renovated her own one-bedroom flat — all without the help from the Bank of Mum and Dad.She believes being bullied every day at school for four years made her set on being a success.“It made me more determined. Everyone who’s ever doubted my ability or capability or challenged that just put a fire in my stomach to go on and be better.”An outstanding attitude and what a role model Liv is.Nothing is more powerful than feeling irrepressible and the desire to cock a snook at the people who don’t want you to achieve.Both these stories prove the same point: If you believe in yourself – and you are prepared to work hard – there is no limit to what you can do.Yes, you need a bit of luck. But in my experience the harder you work, the luckier you get.DJ Sara Cox said this week she has to “work at friendship” as she gets older, words that really resonated for me.When you are young friendships are the backbone of your le and feel effortless.But things change.Andyou aren’t careful you get boring.I’m shocked at how easy it can be to reach a point where you don’t want to go out or do anything in your spare time.But you know what  It’s so important to force yourself off the sofa every so often and have a laugh with your girlfriends. I just need to get Dry January out of the way first.No wonder some envious people have been making mean comments.Meghan has glided through the past few months with real dignity, while also looking a milllion dollars.She is positively glowing. . .  something I never quite managed during pregnancy, despite all the promises.MY heart went out this week to Andy Murray, and the despair he so clearly feels that his body is letting him down and ending his career.It’s a reminder that the toughest part of the job for sports stars is the end. And the higher you’ve flown, the bigger the fall.I had a glimpse of how it feels ten years ago when I sold my business and had a bit of a . . . lull, before the next thing happened.During that time, I’d phone people up and when the receptionist asked me where I was calling from, my answer was, “Um, my living room.”For the first time in my le I wasn’t being defined by my business or my job title.The same will surely be true for Andy when he can no longer say that he is an international tennis player.The dficulty for professional sportspeople on retiring is that, suddenly, everything you have been geared up towards and focusing on is not there any more. There is nothing so harsh as the realisation that you are no longer relevant.I’ve seen this happen to a lot of footballers.One day you are a revered player for a Premier League club where everything is done for you. The next you are on your own, trying to make your way in a not-always-friendly world.In my view, people who cope are those who look forward not back. They look at what is happening in the next chapter, rather than who they once were.Take John McEnroe who is a hugely successful TV pundit and author. He has capitalised on his success – and shared it. And I have a feeling that, when the pain subsides, Andy Murray will do the same.HAS anyone  noticed how many news stories at the moment seem to be about people carrying and using a machete Why on earth would anyone need to carry a machete in England  We don’t live in a jungle, although it might feel like it at times.The only way to stop this epidemic is to pass a law prohibiting the ownership of this type of weapon.Anyone selling them on the internet for dispatch to this country needs to be issued with a UK arrest warrant and prosecuted.NOT quite sure what is motivating everyone to take part in the so-called “Ten-Year Challenge” – where you upload a photo of yourself from ten years ago to social media, together with a recent one, we’ve mocked one up for Adele.The only possible reason to do this, as far as I can see, is to say: “Haven’t I aged well ”I like a challenge . . . but this one’s not for me.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The margin was higher than expected because some Labour MPs abstained, highlighting deep unease in the party about its leader’s fitness for high office.In contrast, even after a sobering setback, Theresa May signalled her determination to seek further concessions from Brussels.Mr Corbyn rebuffed the Prime Minister’s offer of talks unless she ruled out leaving with No Deal. If only he took such an uncompromising stance towards terrorists and despots. In reality, Jeremy Corbyn has no idea what Labour’s policy on Brexit would be.The path ahead is set in law. The UK will leave the EU in  days’ time — preferably with a deal,not on World Trade Organisation terms.  If Labour wants to reverse that legislation, it will require government backing — and the PM has made clear she won’t support it.The EU has asked to hear what alternatives the UK would accept. So this is a moment of truth, a test for the EU. Are they serious about a deal The Government must seek two essential changes. First, a mechanism so we can exit from the backstop — an interim regime of rules.Otherwise we risk being stuck in an indefinite limbo of laws, with no UK say over them.Second, we want a future relationship based on a free trade agreement so we are free to strike deals with other countries, from Latin America to Asia, to create jobs and cut prices in UK shops.If the EU won’t budge, we should keep our pledge to leave on WTO terms. That way, we can mitigate the risks of some short-term disruption.Dissident MPs are firing blanks. The Norway option means more concessions, including giving up UK control over immigration.A second referendum would create more uncertainty, the last thing business wants, and trigger a backlash from the majority who would feel cheated by the rejection of the  result. Pushing back the exit date would just prolong the anguish of this tortuous haggle with Brussels.None look capable of ­mustering support from a majority of MPs. I am struck by how many Remain voters — let alone Leavers — now just want to see Brexit done.It’s time for politicians to re-focus on boosting jobs, easing the cost of living and ensuring high-quality schools and NHS services. But the British people won’t move on from Brexit until their ­politicians keep their promises on Brexit.We’ve argued long enough. It’s time for some national self-belief.  People heard the risks and, yes, we need to manage them. But voters also expect their politicians to offer a more optimistic vision of post-Brexit Britain and grasp the opportunities.We will control our laws and our immigration policy. We will continue to trade in Europe, but broaden our global horizons — which is good for creating jobs, boosting wages, and offering UK consumers cheaper goods and wider choice.We should put rocket boosters up the economy by cutting business taxes and raise the threshold of National Insurance employee contributions to save workers more than £ each year.While we’re at it, a more robust pro-competition policy at home would give small businesses the opportunity to break into markets, end consumer rip-offs and offer customers better deals.Enough wrangling. It’s time to leave the EU and deliver a better post-Brexit UK economy for workers, small businesses and consumers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Borough of Culture is about inspiring people who might not have considered a career in the arts and unlocking their potential.“The Borough of Culture also forms part of the Mayor’s work to tackle the root causes of violent crime, as it will create cultural activities specically designed to be easily accessible to disadvantaged young Londoners."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000463397365.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sob stories ruined sas who dares wins","story":"A political decision that was clearly designed to distract voters and get an easy round of applause.Two things that were never going to stop Channel  enforcing the same rules at its own brilliant version of selection, SAS: Who Dares Wins, evenit was the last show on television that needed any fixing.Its three series have been close to works of art, in fact, largely thanks to their breathtaking settings and four instructors, Ant Middleton, Jason Fox, Matthew Ollerton and Mark Billingham, who gave it such an air of authenticity you could suspend disbelief and imagine you were watching the real thing.As the show’s introduction would have it, though, everything’s changed and they’re a band of brothers no more.The fourth run has  female recruits including a mole called Petra who’s served, for nine years, with Swedish Special forces, on their “front line”.A place which — full ignorant disclosure — I didn’t think extended much beyond the first day of Ikea’s January sales when it all kicks off on Malmo High Street, but actually involved several tours of Afghanistan.Her job here was to spy on all the contestants, and Petra’s certainly done a better job than the production team, because I’ve been watching it for three weeks and can only name three men.First to show, in Chile, was a Muslim called Qash, who voluntarily withdrew after discovering he’d have to share bathroom facilities with the women .  There’s also been no avoiding mentally fragile Nathaniel, or Milo, who’s so camp he makes Alan Carr sound like Lee Marvin.The rest of the  blokes, though, have just become anonymous blips on the horizon while the camera fixates on the women.Among their favourites have been: Saranya, who became the first candidate ever to shout “WHEEEEEEEEEE!” during the ft abseil, tattooed Tracey, blunt Aberdonian Lou, with the voice that goes through you like a rusty bayonet, and television natural Louise, who was the only woman bold enough to challenge a man in the boxing round, and suffered an uncomfortable beating for her troubles.Standards y, but the brutal, straight-down-the-line approach of the four instructors rarely wavers on screen, no matter the gender or how much noise they make.“You having a baby ”“No staff.”“Then shut the f*** up.”This is why you’d probably trust Ant Middleton and the other three with your lives.Politicians and TV people, on the other hand, I trust about as far as I could piggy-back them up the Andes.Almost no encouragement is needed, butyou give them any they will try to reduce every show on TV to one long procession of box-ticking contestants with a crowd-pleasing, right-on ­conclusion.That’s why the most over-worked recruit on this series is the pianist on sob story duties.It may always have had an element of this, of course, but the point when the scales really fell from my eyes was Sunday’s voluntary withdrawal of Nathaniel, who left a letter for the other weeping recruits announcing: “This is just the start of my journey.”You wish him well, obviously, but use of the dreaded J-word wasn’t just the moment I could no longer suspend disbelief, it was also the moment I started to think television was turning SAS selection into Bootcamp on The X Factor.Andthat’s the case, Channel  can have my badge. I’m voluntarily withdrawing from their process.DANCING On Ice viewers can’t say they weren’t warned.“After the break,” said host Phillip Schofield, “Gemma Collins is Marilyn Monroe. Don’t go away.”A big ask. But then so’s stling a fit of the giggles when Richard Blackwood describes himself as “the king of cool”, and trying to look at Ryan Side-bottom’s Beauty and the Beast make-up without thinking of Terry Waite chained to a radiator in the Lebanon.The Gemmasaurus, though, performed at least three television miracles at Sunday’s Musicals-themed night.The first was being hoisted into the DOI rafters, on  board a giant ring, within  seconds, by the same team who got the London Eye upright.The second involved claiming the moral high ground, from Jason Gardiner, during a spectacular toddler tantrum at the end of her Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend routine.And the third, but biggest of all, was somehow getting voted through to next week’s show despite re-writing the entire history of musicals. Gentlemen, it transpires, no longer prefer blondes.They can’t  stand them, in fact.QUIZ show doughballs of the week.

Holly Willoughby: “Love against the odds is the subject of the phone-in today. Vanessa Feltz, what kind of calls are you hoping for today ”“We’re looking for calls from people who think their love is against the odds.”And that’s why it’s about to win a National Television Award for the ninth year in a row. ANOTHER week brings another incompatible pair of reality TV gimps, with an E title that also sounds suspiciously like their viewing figures.Spencer, Vogue and Baby Too, a fly-on-the-wall documentary, about Matthews and Williams of that ilk, which is based  on the classic misapprehension of every first-time parent: The world is simply full of people who give the slightest toss about their newborn.It’s not. Nor is anyone listening when they bang on about the “tiredness, sleepless nights and blah blah blah”.The only reason I kept watching this one, in fact, was to try to establish exactly how Spencer and Vogue earn a living, as they’re one of those independently wealthy couples who give very little clue as to why they’re always so “busy, busy, busy”.It took a couple of episodes, but eventually Vogue muttered some- thing about her own fake tan range and Spencer said something even less convincing about cooking, before adding: “We bring dferent things to the table.” The urge Spencer really wants to milk, it turns out though, is a creative one. So, at the climax of episode two he’s striding into London’s Soho Theatre for an audition, with the defiant announcement: “I’m going to open or shut the door on my childhood dream of becoming an actor.”And how’s that going Make sure it bangs your a*** on the way out, Spencer.TV GOLD: The Paras: Men Of War, on ITV. BBC’s Revolution In Ruins: The Hugo Chavez Story detailing exactly how socialism, with Jeremy Corbyn’s connivance, destroyed Venezuela, the most oil-rich country in South America.Sky Atlantic repeating series one of The Sopranos.

Ah, oui, Dominique. Not as British as you might think, Grieve.Which may explain why he  is now doing such terrible damage to our national interest and to the future of our parliamentary system by trying to block Brexit. Over the two decades since he became an MP in , this pukka, posh-suited, punctilious figure has been a pedantic regular in House of Commons debates.He would crook one of his little fingers at an angle, give his neck muscles a creaky tweak and insist, with a shot of the cuffs and a shuffle of minimal notes, that ministers and officials must always comply with statute and precedent and time-honoured procedure.When giving these lectures — they were seldom short — he would touch the rim of his glasses, give a little mallard-style cough and allow a patronising smile to inhabit his broadening bill.He would explain that raw political instinct and passion, of the sort voiced by the Nigel Farages and Jeremy Corbyns of this world,  were not by themselves good enough in politics. He looked down on such things.Politicians whose demagogic brio reflected the public’s molten anger  Puh-lease, how vulgar. They did not accord with Grieve’s gods of logic.“With respect,” he would say — and it is one of the older truths of Westminster that when people say “with respect” they mean the sneery opposite — “with respect, we have to do things according to the rules, for that is the way this Parliament works and those are the sort of people we are.”I paraphrase him but that was very much Grieve’s position. He was a creature of propriety.He could cite legal sub-section and addendum and annex and codicil that proved, we were told, the unarguable merits of his position.With Monsieur half-French Grieve, the ancient principles of English law were our majesty. Our mainstay!Plenty of us clocked that Grieve was a bit of a prune, an oddball, the fogeyish son of privilege. His dad Percy, wouldn’t you know it, had also been a Tory MP of the gusset-and-sock-suspenders old school.Percy once worked as a liaison officer for French wartime hero Charles de Gaulle, who hated the British . It was said that Old Man Grieve agreed with de Gaulle.“The trouble with Percy  is that he likes foreigners  a great deal better than his own people,” concluded an acquaintance.Dominic, in childhood, worshipped his father and once won a school oratory contest by making an admiring speech about de Gaulle.Does “Dominique”, too, like continentals better than his fellow countrymen  It sure looks that way. In June , in one of the greatest thumpings our elite was ever given by the people, we voted to leave the EU. Dominic Grieve, newly decorated with France’s Legion d’honneur for his political work, was horried.Indignant. You could even say he was ag-Grieved. And so he touched the rims of his glasses, did some ducky quacking and set to work to block Brexit.The trouble, as has often been pointed out to him, was that the democratic vote had gone against him.At first he said, through gritted teeth , that he would respect the result of the referendum.In  he was re-elected as MP for prosperous Beaconsfield, Bucks,  on a Tory manesto which said exactly that.Every Tory MP promised to get us out of the customs union and single market.Labour MPs also promised to honour the referendum result. What lying bastards these people are. When the new Government started to get into political dficulties, the once-principled Grieve saw his chance. He stopped saying he would respect the referendum result. He wanted us to stay in the customs union. He wanted a second referendum.Most startling of all, he plotted to bypass all those rules and time-honoured procedures he used to say were so vital for our political safety.After a secret meeting with the appallingly biased John Bercow, Grieve got that anti-Brexit Commons Speaker to chuck out centuries of accepted debating rules.Propriety was smashed like plates at a Greek wedding. Legal advice was ignored.This former Attorney General’s campaign against Brexit, which will next week see him and a minority of MPs attempt to remove law-making from the elected Government, took on a wild, crazed aspect.The possible upshots for our democratic system are terrying. When MPs stop even bothering to pretend they will honour their election promises, why should anyone vote Why not just seize power by force  It’s a recipe for anarchy on the streets.At the moment, Corbyn’s Labour Party is going along with Grieve and Bercow but Corbyn will surely eventually realise that warping parliamentary rules to stop an elected Government from governing will do him no favourshe himself becomes Prime Minister.  It always takes time for the penny to drop with dozy Corbyn.Meanwhile, we are left  with the bizarre spectacle of one-time legal details nerd Dominic Grieve going back  on everything he ever stood for, overturning ancient parliamentary conventions.All along, it seems, his loyalties were not to a rules-based system but to the blue flag of a European Union that is now, increasingly, our rival and our deadly threat.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When they cried and said sorry I forgave them. I never learnt.Now in her early s, she has had plastic surgery to recover from her injuries, but still has both physical and emotional le-long scars.The Yakuza are believed to run the Japanese sex trade, where they lure in women from around the world with promises of visas, only to take their passport and drive them into debt so they are forced to work in brothels - its thought they are capitalising on Asias growing status as a destination for sex tourism.Surveys have found  per cent of Japanese men have paid for sex and  per cent of junior and high school girls have been solicited by middle-aged men.And their network of brothels is not limited to Japan, but also Korea, Thailand and the Philippines where foreigners would fly specically to for sex parties.There has, to date, been just one female Yakuza leader, Fumiko Taoka, who briefly led her dead husband Kazuo Taokas gang until a new male leader was chosen in  As well as having heavily-tattooed bodies, the Yakuza can often be identied by their lack of a pinky finger.This is because members - who are initiated into gangs with sword-fighting and meditation lessons - have them amputated as punishmentthey step out of line, usually because they are unable to pay off gambling debts or fail to complete a task such as a killing or importing drugs.The process known as yubitsume - which translates to finger shortening - dates back to the eighteenth century when the pinky finger was key for helping to grip the Japanese Kendo sword.Without it, warriors are weaker and more reliant on their leader.Today the ritual involves the member chopping it off themselves before handing it over to their boss who keeps it as a trophy.If gang members continue to offend their bosses, they either face more yubitsume, or expulsion.The latter is the worst punishment, as those who are kicked out are unable to associate with gang members for the rest of their lives.Former Yakuza members who have since ed to non-criminal society can struggle to find work due to their associations with the gang, so often wear specially-made prosthetic fingers - costing £, - to disguise it.The practice of finger shortening is thought to have died out in recent decades because it is an easy way for police to identy possible criminals.Despite their violent ways, the gang has a white collar image, which sees them have offices, registered members, business cards, press conferences and be praised for helping the  earthquake and tsunami relief funds.They sent trucks from the Tokyo and Kobe regions to deliver food, water, blankets and toiletries to evacuation centres in northeast Japan - getting there quicker than the Japanese authorities.“Yakuza are dropouts from society,” said author Manabu Miyazaki, the son of a former Yakuza boss, toldrecently. They’ve suffered, and they’re just trying to help other people who are in trouble.In Japan, tattoos are almost entirely associated with being a member of the Yakuza - the ,-strong organised crime syndicate which has shocked the world with its ruthless illegal business dealings in drugs and firearms, organ trading and sex trafficking.Their most notorious leader Kazuo Taoka was nicknamed The Bear, as he had a penchant for clawing at his opponents eyes.He once survived being shot in the neck, and his attacker was found weeks later dead in woodland near Kobe.The Yakuza are also known for their brazen assassinations - which happen as often in broad daylight as under the cover of darkness.And in , the Mayor of Nagasaki, Itcho Ito, was shot twice in the back by a gang member, Tesuya Shiroo, over his administrations refusal to choose Yakuza firms for lucrative construction contracts.Before that, in , the particularly-violent Yakuza family, the Kudo-kai, who are based in Kitakyushu, gunned down a -year-old man who refused to give them favourable treatment for public works projects.A spate of violence will often follow funerals of murdered members, which, interestingly, members of all groups will often attend.At their height, the Yakuza had a massive , members.Infighting between gangs is often bloody -  one series of clashes left  dead and more than  injured in a matter of days in , in a country which has an extraordinarily low murder rate.The American Mafia only had an estimated , members at its peak - whereas the Yakuzas largest gang, the Yamaguchi-gumi in Kobe, alone recently listed , membersAmong the many famous illegal Yakuza enterprises - which has in the past included helping former Japanese prime minister Kakuei Tanaka secure his leadership by paying off members of a rival party, is organ trading, including kidneys and livers.In , a doctor, Toshinobu Horiuchi was arrested after it was discovered he was collaborating with the Yakuza to fake an adoption in order to obtain organs.He was suffering from kidney failure and needed a new one. He met the we of a Yakuza in a bar who promised to source him a new one for £,.They planned to help him adopt a -year-old male stranger - as organ donation is only available between family members in Japan - so the man could pass on his healthy kidney.In recent decades the Yakuza have also helped Japanese kidney patients travel to Taiwan and Singapore to purchase organs without consent from executed prisoners.The demand is exacerbated by the fact that Japanese culture doesnt believe in organ donation, and because Yakuza tattoos - so thick they block sweat from leaving the body - take a toxic toll on members livers.In , there was outrage in the United States when Tadamasa Goto, founder of gang the Goto-gumi, struck a deal with the FBI where he would give them information on the Yakuza and donate money to UCLA Medical Centre in Los Angelesthey helped arrange liver transplants for him and three of his associates.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its true purpose is to buy time to kill Brexit.Mrs May is still set on the one sensible course: to persuade the EU to tweak the deal and try for a Commons majority.If Remainers defeat it we are in  dangerous waters, as the PM has a duty to point out.ALL along, our negotiations have been let down by defeatism and naivety.Theresa May’s Remainer envoy Olly Robbins was outsmarted at every turn.Even now, as the PM suggests ing to Brussels to amend the backstop, Robbins texts another Eeyore — Philip Hammond — to say it isn’t worth it.Which is why replacing him immediately with hard-bitten Kiwi trade negotiator Crawford Falconer makes sense.Put a pro in charge.NOW Brussels admits it WILL build a hard border in Irelandthe deal is defeated.Marvel at their folly, and Irish PM Leo Varadkar’s. Their solution to avoid the border was so  tough on Britain that they could end up with one much faster.The answer is obvious. Time-limit the backstop to win over the Commons.Then focus every effort on technology to solve the problem before that deadline.CHAOS aside, our economy surges ahead.More in work than ever. The lowest unemployment in  years. Pay up . per cent, inflation at just . per cent.It makes mugs of those who forecast  immediate meltdownwe voted Leave. Even the OECD chief once petried of No Deal has U-turned. “The whole world runs by WTO rules these days,” he says.Cracks are also appearing in Brussels’ armour.

He was so quick. He came flying out of nowhere.It looks like he was trying to fly past them, but the guy in the red car had pulled into the lane he was in.The driver was an ex-race car driver, but the guy was going so fast so he didnt see him properly until he was there.He probably checked the mirror, seen nothing in and pulled out.Instead of just slamming on his brakes, the Toyota tried to cut in front of him again.As Aston approached the scene, he saw Len and his we were luckily uninjured, however the passenger door was so damaged she wasnt able to get out.Aston said: The couple he hit must have been in their sixties and luckily they were physically unharmed - just shaken up.The wheel arch was smashed up, there was damage to the passenger door which couldnt be open to get his we out.It was still drivable though because we followed the guy and tried to find him. He sped off.I was surprised that the guy managed to control the car and not end up in a ditch on the side of the road.[Len] did really well to control the car and not tip it over. He didnt actually hit the other car - I dont know how. He must have just skimmed it.The driver of that other car on the left chased him down with us because he was so angry he nearly hit him too.After ensuring the couple were safe, Aston and the driver of another vehicle that was narrowly missed followed the Toyota, finding the owner hiding at a nearby car wash.According to Aston, the reckless driver tried to blame the older couple for the collision and refused to admit fault.Aston said: He got away from us, but we knew the direction he went and saw his car hidden at a car wash.I got out my car and luckily he wasnt aggressive, but he was blaming Len in the red car.He said you see him hit me  you see him hit me I couldnt believe that hed driven like that then tried to blame the elderly couple. He wasnt sorry at all for it.He could have killed him and not known because hed sped ahead.Aston spoke to the Ford Fiesta driver after the crash to send him footage of the incident and claims he was told the police were not investigating as no-one was injured or killed.However Kent Police have now come back to confirm officers are looking into the crash.Aston said: The police are looking into it but they werent interested in first place because no-one was injured or killed.Theres been a few crashes on that bridge - its quite a steep cross-over. A quite famous one was a -car pile-up five years ago.They have an average speed camera but I think a lot of people assume theyre not turned on or working because Ive seen loads of people speeding.That whole stretch people drive really fast.A spokesperson for Kent Police said: Kent Police is investigating a collision which is reported to have taken place on the Sheppey Crossing on the afternoon on Monday  January .The incident is reported to have involved three vehicles and no injuries were reported.Officers are conducting ongoing enquiries to establish the full circumstances."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/KH-COMPOSITE-GRAPH-UNEMPLOYMENT-4.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jobs up economy up earnings up so what happened to predictions of brexit bust","story":"Job numbers, average earnings and GDP growth are all on the up, while the deficit continues to fall.Brexiteers have welcomed the news - insisting it shows Britain is well prepared to quit the EU.The economic boost flies in the face of dire warnings about how the UK would suffervoters opted to quit the EU in .More Brits are in work than ever before - and new stats released yesterday show the employment boom is continuing.A total of .million have jobs, with , added to the economy in the last three months alone.Unemployment stands at just  per cent, its lowest level in  years.That is less than half the level in France - while in Italy and Spain the jobless rate is more than  per cent.After a two-year squeeze on wages, average pay has been climbing back upwards in recent months.Salaries stand at £, a year - up . per cent on a year earlier.That means wages are outpacing inflation by . per cent, increasing the spending power of Brits.The International Monetary Fund says Britain is now on course to grow faster than Germany and Italy.The UKs expected GDP growth is . per cent this year and . per cent in , more than most other large rich countries.If Mrs May does get a Brexit deal through Parliament, the economy could grow even more, the IMF said.Meanwhile Frances growth is being held back by the yellow vests street protests and Italy is damaged by a huge spending splurge.After more than eight years of austerity, Britain is finally seeing the benefits of the spending squeeze.Borrowing over the past year is at its lowest level since  as the gap between public spending and tax revenues falls.And the pile of public debt is shrinking as a proportion of GDP - although it still adds up to £.trillion."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004617682221.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markles hunky new press secretary sets pulses racing","story":"The Duchess of Sussex, , is understood to have hired Christian Jones to handle her media affairs as she prepares to welcome her first child this spring.It comes after the pair were spotted leaving a posh Italian restaurant in Notting Hill, west London, on Friday.Jones official title is Deputy Communications Secretary and works for both Meghan and Harry - as well as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, according to E!

Now the German Chancellor has summed up many of the factors that led to it in a snappy video. She said the UK had enjoyed a patchy relationship with the EU, opting out of the Schengen zone and the Euro. They have always said: we are an island, we want more independence. Many of the thousands who shared the video say this was just a statement of fact. But not Tory MP Johnny Mercer. The Brexiteer tweeted the video with the pithy reply: Jeez. Bye.   That triggered an onslaught of comments to the Plymouth Moor View MP - some positive, and some very negative. Winston Churchills hashtag-loving grandson, the Tory MP Nicholas Soames, wrote: #anabsolutelyhistoricallydisastrousdecisionbyourwonderfulcountry. Allie Renison, head of Europe and Trade policy at the Institute of Directors, wrote: Um, this is literally many Leavers arguments rationale for the UK leaving...not a criticism at all.

One wrote: Translation: The UK never gave up full control of its borders and currency, and for that reason we dont like them. Perhaps Mr Mercer didnt get to the bit later in the video when Ms Merkel talked about the relationship shed like to see with the UK. After Brexit, she said, we and Britain orce in a good process and work closely on defence, counter-terrorism, security, policing, trade and research projects. Ms Merkel made the comments during the signing of a French-German friendship treaty with Emmanuel Macron yesterday.  She said: The relationship of Great Britain to Europe was always very patchy. They abstained from many of the policies. They are not in the euro zone, they are not part of the free travel area, they dont take part in domestic policies. They have always said: we are an island, we want more independence.

Government loyalist Andrew Murrison tabled an amendment to Theresa Mays Withdrawal Bill to set an expiry date on the Northern Ireland backstop.   The amendment was not chosen by the Speaker and the PMs deal was rejected by  votes.On Monday Theresa May ed to the Commons to put forward her plan B - which involves minor tweaks to her first plan.MPs are now putting forward amendments to try and seize control of the process.Mr Murrison believes his amendment, which imposes a time-limit on the backstop, could help Mrs May get her deal through the Commons by appealing to moderate MPs who just want Brexit sorted. But Mr Barnier has insisted there can be no time limit on the backstop.He told them: The backstop is like an insurance. It is not there to be used. Andso, only provisionally. However, we cannot tie the backstop to a time limit.   Asked why not, he told journalists: Imagineyour home’s insurance was limited to five years and you’d have a problem after six years... Thats dficult to justy, he replied. Its similar with the backstop. That is why it is tied to an event: as soon as there is an agreement between the EU and the UK that makes an internal border unnecessary, it will be obsolete. Let me remind you that we have negotiated the elements of the backstop with the British government and have integrated their wishes into it. On Tuesday the EU insisted that a no deal Brexit would mean a hard border on the island of Ireland.At a press conference the chief spokesman for European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, said it was “pretty obvious” border infrastructure would be necessarythere was no agreement.   But on Wednesday they backtracked. The same spokesman said: The EU is determined to do all it can - deal or no deal- to avoid a hard border in Ireland. Meanwhile the chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commissionsaid the Withdrawal Agreement reached between the UK and the EU left signicant gaps in the protection of human rights. Emily Logan said: I dont think the public understand that the implications... people might find themselves in a situation of being forced to assume an identy they wouldnt choose. Ms Logan said the offer of continued EU citizenship should be extended to all the people of NorthernIreland as defined by the Good Friday Agreement, given recognition of the birthright of people in NorthernIrelandto identy as Irish or British, or both. The last situation we wish to see is one where the people of NorthernIrelandfeel forced to choose their identity based on what they think their post-Brexit entitlements might be, she said.

The -year-old is the chief of ancient Scottish Clan Mackay, whose leader Donald Mackay was handed a peerage by Charles I. According to the Clan Mackay Society, folklore describes Lord Reay as a magician who won a work-loving gang of fairies in an encounter with a witch in a cave.His coat of arms is said to be two daggers pointed at a roebucks head surrounded by the heads of three muzzle-wearing bears.   But the th Lords existence has been a bit less mystical. He went to pound,-a-year Westminster School before founding a corporate finance advisory boutique and working in New York. His father, the th Lord, sat in the Lords for almost  years and campaigned against onshore wind farms before his death in .

Labour leader in the Lords Baroness Smith added: As much as we welcome an inidual Lord, the system has had its day. It is increasingly dficult to defend - a temporary measure that has gone on beyond its time. Todays election result was a hangover from Tony Blairs bid to modernise the House of Lords. Hereditary peers were mostly cast out in  but  remained as a compromise. That means when one dies or retires, there is an election to find their replacement. But only hereditary peers can stand in that election, and only members of the House of Lords can vote. The latest election was held to replace Tory Lord Skelmersdale, an Old Etonian who sat in the Lords for  years before his death in October.

Mr Lewis had used a joint appearance on the BBCs Politics Live to ask a simple question - could Brexit be delayed.Theresa May has said she wants to leave on March , but has pointedly not ruled out that it could happen. So Mr Skidmore continued the Groundhog Day feel by not giving a straight answer, instead insisting it was an open question. Mr Lewis exploded: This is what annoys people, youre not answering! Youre not being clear at all! Ive asked you a question. The question is would you support an extension. Yes or no  As Mr Skidmore insisted we are working towards  March, Mr Lewis huffed and puffed - and hurled his notes into the air.  The conversation is especially relevant because a delay to Brexit is looking more likely than ever. Labour looks set to join with backbencher Yvette Cooper and Tory rebels to delay the March  date in order to block No Deal. Their bid is due for a vote next Tuesday night - andLabour formally backs it, it should have more than enough support to pass. The amendment led by Labours Yvette Cooper and Tory Nick Boles would force the Prime Minister to request a delay to Brexitthere is still no deal by February .  Furious Tory Cabinet minister Liam Fox today claimed the amendment would not actually have the power to delay Brexit - and said doing so would be worse than leaving with no deal. But Tory former Chancellor George Osborne said no deal would be a bullet in your head, adding: At the moment delay looks the most likely option. And Pascal Cagni, French ambassador for international investment, said his prediction is now that the  March date of Brexit will be postponed.

Jeremy Corbyn cherry picked the best questions put by his backbenchers and put them again to the Prime Minister. They were all reasonable issues to raise with Mrs May but they lacked any sense of originality. So for the second time he asked why she would not rule out a no deal. And for the second time he askedher mind was closed to a customs union.  Mrs May kindly colluded with the Labour leader by giving the exact same responses as she delivered three days earlier. Like her opposite number, she also lacked spontaneity and crowdsourced her answers from observations on Twitter. She pointed out, with a mock sense of hurt, that Mr Corbyn had been willing to talk to Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA but was unwilling to meet with her. Mr Corbyn responded by borrowing Hilary Benn’s observation that the PM’s door may be open but the “mind was closed.” Mrs May then chose the curious tactic of following her renewed invitation to the Labour leader for talks by insulting him over his knowledge of Brexit. “I don’t think he knows what these phrases mean or what these phrases are,” she said. Mr Corbyn was on stronger ground by noting that Labour’s plan to stay in the customs union was backed by both the TUC and the CBI.  He perhaps missed an opportunity by not raising the exodus from the UK by countries such as Dyson and Sony. Brexit Kremlinologists will have noted that Mrs May did not rule out membership of a customs union in answer to Corbyn’s questions. But as whole this PMQs did not take us much further forward other to remind viewers that both leaders are wedded to intransigence. It took questions from Labours Sarah Jones on Grenfell and John Mann on mental health to remind you that Prime Ministers questions is not a completely wasteful exercise.

The flaming hot fillet of fish is coated in a blazing batter made from ten heat-packed ingredients and then doused in chillies and hot sauce. The fiery concoction is the brainchild of father and son team Nick and David Miller, owners of Millers Fish and Chips, which has been running since . Nick, , and David, , have been developing the recipe for a month and tried it out on staff members and loyal customers before adding it to the menu on Tuesday.   Brave diners will be charged pound. for a standard sized portion and have to sign a document before tucking in, so Millers arent held responsible for its effects. Millers, in Haxby, outside York, North Yorks, was named best fish and chip shop in the UK at the  National Fish  Chip Awards. Nick said: Its important to offer something a bit dferent now and again. We’ve ended up with a battered fillet which tastes incredible but is ridiculously spicy. Im slightly scared to see what happens once customers start ordering it. Weve already tried it out with a few customers who said they were lovers of spicy food and they were blown away by the heat.   Anyone who orders will have to sign a piece of paper to say they dont hold us responsible for what might happen when they take a bite. Despite being incredibly spicy, the flavours are actually really nice so Im hoping some people might actually enjoy it. The recipe is made up of ten heat-packed ingredients including chilli powder, dried chillis, cayenne pepper, paprika, chilli flakes and hot sauce. Also included is a smattering of Seabrook Fire Eaters Scorchin Hot Trinidad Scorpion Chilli Crisps, which are said to be the spiciest on the market. David, whos dad set Millers up during the Second World War, said: This isnt quite traditional but I think its important to move with the times. Its exciting to try out new things and dferent recipes.  I think what weve come up with is actually delicious, as long as you like a bit of spice. Marcus Coleman, CEO of Seafish who run the National Fish and Chip Awards, said: “Nick, David and the team at Millers are always challenging the norm when it comes to delicious fish and chips.

Andrew Samuel, , watched the sunset with Natalie Morris, , after travelling to the idyllic island of Lembongan. The hearing was told it was the couples first night on the small Indonesian island and they had been on a moped, gone for a meal and ed to their villa to watch DVDs. The couple had been sipping Bombay Sapphire gin and tonics by their small private pool after getting back at around .pm. Andrew said: It was literally one of the most perfect evenings that you could have had. It was just really nice. We got to the island and it was such a picturesque island.  Andrew said the couple had watched the sunset and discussed plans on what to do for Natalies th birthday. He said: We were making plans for the future. It was such a nice day there was nothing sad about it at all. The inquest heard Andrew went to bed around midnight but Natalie decided to stay up to finish her drink and have a cigarette. But Andrew woke up at .am to discover his girlfriend had not come to bed and he rushed outside. The inquest heard Natalie was discovered face down in the pool of the Secret Outlook villa and desperate Andrew ed in to save her and carried out CPR.   Emergency services were called but Natalie was pronounced dead on September  last year. The inquest heard there was a partly smoked cigarette and a lighter about a foot from the edge of the pool. Andrew said: My hypothesis of what happened is that I think Nat had been having a cigarette. I think she was probably, knowing her, having a dance and I assume she must have been on the side of the pool. I believe that she must have slipped, hit her head on the side of the pool and unfortunately rolled the wrong way. Because she was tall enough to stand up in the pool. If she was not unconscious she would have been able to stand up. From where the cigarette was it looked like she would have fallen and dropped it.   The inquest heard the couple had been sitting on decking that was about six foot from the pool. There was outdoor lighting and the private pool and garden were securely locked with a ten foot wall surrounding it. Andrew said they were onlytipsy after enjoying a few drinks and he heard nothing after going to bed. He added: If there was a shout I think I would have heard it. The inquest heard the couple had only just decided to go to Lembongan after a typhoon had changed their original plans. A post mortem examination in Bali found no external injuries. Her cause of death was given as drowning. The inquest heard there was alcohol found in Natalies system and internal bruising was found to the left side of the front of the head. Natalie, originally of Merthyr, South Wales, had been dating Andrew for four years and the couple lived in Cardf Bay. She was an executive assistant at Travis Perkins builders yard.   Sister Janine Lloyd said in a statement: Natalie and Andrew brought out the best in each other and were as close as any couple could be. She was really at her peak before the time of her untimely death. Natalie was a light that shone so brightly it seemed impossible that it would go out. Coroner Andrew Barkley ed a narrative conclusion at the inquest in Pontypridd. He said: The evidence doesnt tell us how she got into the pool and neither does it tell us why she couldnt extract herself from the pool. Recording his conclusion, Mr Barkley said: Natalie Morris died from the effects of drowning in circumstances which are unclear. The evidence does not reveal how she entered the water.

Adam Ali shared photos of himself in Dubai after fleeing the country, despite having been charged over allegations of dangerous driving. In the images, he could be seen partying with celebs Anthony Joshua and Gordon Ramsay, apparently showing little remorse for his actions.There is no indication that either celebrity knew of the -year-olds criminality when they posed for photographs with him. Ali taunted police through his Instagram feed by regularly sharing images of himself in clubs and driving sports cars. He appeared to be living a lavish lestyle.  But the partygoer, from Thornwood, Epping, has now been extradited from the United Arab Emiratesand appeared at Southwark Crown Court yesterday. Ali had previously been sentenced to three years imprisonment after being convicted - in his absence - of possession of ammunition and dangerous driving. And he was sentenced to an additional  months imprisonment for his failure to surrender to the court. This sentence will run concurrently. Ali was arrested and charged on January ,  ,after officers went to his home in Epping in relation to allegations of dangerous driving. During a search of his house ammunition was discovered.   After being bailed toto court later in January , Ali fled to Dubai on the first day of his trial. He was found guilty in his absence and was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court on  October  to three years imprisonment. Officers established that Ali was somewhere in Dubai, where he appeared to lead a very lavish and luxurious lestyle. In September , police were alerted through information published on his account that Ali had made a trip to the USA. With some investigation, it was deemed that he made this trip under an alias, Adam Khala. Through the joint collaboration between Dubai Police, Dubai Public Prosecutors, Interpol, the National Crime Agency and the Met, Ali was identied coming back into the UAE and was arrested at the airport by UAE authorities on  November . The extradition process then began.  Met officers travelled to Dubai on  January and Ali was extradited back to the UK on  January. Upon hisAli was held in a west London police station before his appearance in court yesterday. Detective Sergeant Andy Swindells, of the Westminster Crime Squad, which investigated this case from the beginning, said: It is satisfying to know that Ali is now where he belongs and will rightly serve time in prison for his crimes. A lot of time and police work has gone into securing this result and I would like to thank the NCA and our international colleagues who were integral to this success. We will do everything in our power to bring to justice those who attempt to evade us. Ian Cruxton, head of International Operations at the NCA, said: Ali fled justice to live a lavish lestyle somewhere he thought his crimes wouldnt catch up with him.

Christian Joneshas reportedly been hired to handle the Duchess of Sussexs media business, with the pair spotted leaving a swish Notting Hill Italian restaurant in west London. Royal fans have been quick to express their delight at the royal mum-to-bes choice - branding him a hottie and admiring his rugged good looks. Twitter user Elizabeth Cotignola said: We need to talk about Meghan Markles new press secretary, sparking dozens of comments about the former government press officer.   Gigi wrote on Twitter: Press secretary is cute, while P Zapata wrote: What a hottie. Some teased Harry might have to watch out with such a handsome man being welcomed into the royal fold, reports news.au. One person wrote: Careful Harry, Meghan has a new younger handsome man around now. It is believed Christians official title will be Deputy Communications Secretary. He previously worked in a number of roles for the British government, including Chief Press Officer for the Treasury between -, reports news.au.   He is also understood to have worked as a speech writer for the Department of Exiting the European Union. His appointment comes after a number of staff working for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were reportedly quitting their roles. Most recently, the -year-old Duchess was said to be gutted at losing her chief protection officer. The Scotland Yard inspector’s departure marked the third resignation among her senior aides in less than a year - signalling a worrying trend. Reports emerged last month that Meghan had been nicknamed Duchess Dficult’ by staff inside the palace walls, because of how demanding she can allegedly be. Meghan’s personal assistant, Melissa Touabti, walked-away from Kensington Palace last year after managing just six months in the position.   And private secretary, Samantha Cohen, is also rumoured to be leaving the Sussex’s workforce after more than  years of working for the Royal Family. According to The Sunday Times, there is nothing to suggest a personality clash between Meghan and the protection officer, but a source told the paper Markle’s desire to be seen as “one of the people” offers a number of challenges to her team. The female bodyguard has not been named publicly.

Kelley Robinson, , put on eight stone - weighing st at a size  - since she gave birth to her son Kylo. She began to feel her knee buckling under the pressure of her enormous frame until she started taking diet pills. But she found that combined with working out, she could actually control her calorie intake much more effectively with the microwave meals. She now weighs a healthy st for her  frame and is a comfy dress size , Cornwall Live reports.  Her chest and cup size also slimmed down - from a F to a more proportionate E. Kelley said: The ready meals made it so easy for me to keep track of exactly what I was consuming calorie wise. They were quick and easy too. It may not sound healthy but I chose low cal ones and it really helped me get started on my weight loss journey. it has got to the point now where people dont actually recognise me on the street. An old friend of mine did a double take the other day when I said hi as she didnt notice it was me at all. My whole outlook on le is dferent. Before all I did was sit about on the sofa and order takeaways whereas now Im super active and have tonnes of energy all the time.  Kelleywas a size  before having Kylo, now three, but after he was born she developed unhealthy eating habits. She typically has white toast for breakfast, followed by sandwich and crisps for lunch, a takeaway for dinner, while snacking on more crisps, fizzy drinks and chocolate. She piled on eight stone, but soon got fed up, and when she got desperate she tried diet pills. They were dreadful, I had no energy and couldnt stop pooing the whole time, she admitted. It was around this time that her fitness fanatic fianceacute, Ryan Lake, stepped in to help. She said: Ryan was amazing, he could see how depressed I was and just gently took control but by coaxing me to the gym. Id never have had the confidence to do it without him. At first I found it so hard, I wanted to give up, I really hated it but I kept at it and with the changes in my diet too I found that I was actually losing weight! She also started eating ready meals, which were typically between  and  calories a meal. Her favourites were Morrison’s Chicken Tikka Masala, Beef Hot Pots or Macaroni, and she started eating Weetabix and fruit for breakfast, with wraps for lunch. The new mum stopped snacking between meals and started swapping sweet drinks for water.  In the first three months of her new regime she lost a whopping three stone. Kelleysaid: It was after that when I got really strict with myself because I realised that I actually I could do it. I cut out carbs, dairy and even quit the ready meals eventually. In a year Kelley had lost NINE stone. She admitted: Im such a gym bunny now its unreal I go whenever I have a second and absolutely love it. I even get up super early before the kids wake up to go and workout for an hour. I go at least six times a week and make sure to do a mix of cardio and weights. Doing the weights have meant that the saggy skin has really toned up, which is one thing I was worried about losing quite so much. Dedicated Keeley, who is also mother to -year-old Tamzin, has noticed far more than just weight loss benefits from her new regime. Her knees are no longer a problem and her down days are well behind her. The mum-of-two said: I was quite low before as I felt so under-confident but these days I really do feel like a new person. One thing I know is that I couldnt have done it without the support of my amazing family, especially Ryan, who loved me whatever size I was but always wanted the best for me.

Her parents had tried to get in contact with the estate agent over the weekend and Shannon said she was told a plumber would finally be round on Monday. As a result of having no heating or hot water, the mother said she was forced to go round to her parents house in order to wash her sons, two-year-old Azaan and nine-month old Sahil.   She also said she was forced to sleep three in a bed for four nights, while using an electric blanket in order to stay warm, because every room in the house was freezing. Shannon said: On Friday the boiler in my house started leaking and producing a strange burning smell, before it stopped working. I immediately rang Ashton Estates to ask them to come round and fix the boiler, as I have two very young sons who I cannot keep in a freezing house, and they told me that a plumber would be round to fix it. Come pm nobody had arrived, so I began to ring the emergency number. I tried numerous times to get through but was unable and eventually the phone itself was turned off.   Over the weekend I tried to ring them again, and so did my parents, with us leaving a lot of voicemails asking them to come and fix the boiler. However nobody got back to us at all. We were then told that a plumber would be round on Monday, but still nobody showed up. Because of this I was forced to look after my children in a freezing house, and the only source of heat that we had was a broken radiator that probably isnt safe and an electric blanket. It takes the radiator about five hours to heat a room and both items use a lot of electricity. My children had to wash at my parents house. I just wanted someone to come round and fix our boiler, I have two infant sons and they shouldnt have to live like this.   A spokesperson from Ashton Estates said a plumber visited the property on Tuesday and managed to get the boiler working again but said the reason it had not been working was due to no gas being on the meter, a claim refuted by Shannon. Ashton Estates said: Our plumbers are very busy but managed to get round earlier today and the gas is now back on. We found the issue to be that there was no gas on the meter, although the plumber did not actually look at the meter itself. They have said that a notication on the boiler indicated to them that there was no gas. Shannon said she did have gas in the meter for the whole weekend, and that the plumber had told her that there was an issue with steam in the boiler and that was what caused it to break.

Scotland Yard continues to tackle the horric kne crime epidemic which plagued London, and other large cities, in . And in just two weeks, the force has seized a shocking number of weapons - including a machete and a hunting kne. It has tweeted almost  pictures of the confiscated knives, used in robberies, left in bushes and gathered in stop and searches. One terrying image, shared by the politan Police, shows a crook’s attempt to conceal a razor-sharp kne in a plastic shopping bag. Officers also discovered a discarded weapon lying by a walkway on an estate in Tottenham, north London.  Meanwhile, a machete, at least  inches long, was recovered following a moped chase in Catford, southeast London. Other large blades were seized from children as young as  over a two-week period. In one incident in Camden, north London, three knives were taken from the same thug after he decided to use a meat cleaver as a weapon.  And a sickening picture tweeted by police in Islington shows a -inch sword a suspect was allegedly carrying along with several bags of cannabis. Affluent areas like Notting Hill and Highgate - home to celebrities including Kate Moss and Jude Law - arent free from those who choose to carry blades either. One was unearthed on a Highgate street, while officers attending a disturbance in upper-class Notting Hill allegedly took a kitchen kne, baseball bat and a rolling pin from a group of three men.  And according to Kensington and Cha Police’s Twitter account, a Batman-shaped knuckle duster was discovered on an estate during a stop and search for driving offences. Last year was one of the worst in recent years for murders in London. Figures show the number of people killed hit a -year high with more than a fth of victims teenagers or children. The  homicides recorded by the politan Police included  where the victims were aged  or under. Of those,  were stabbed, five were shot and one woman was killed by a head injury. It was London’s highest homicide total since , which saw  people killed, and a  per cent rise year-on-year. politan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick had recently named street violence as her number one priority and acknowledged that  was challenging.  Kne crime campaigners have welcomed the ongoing work to remove weapons and praised police for putting the images on their Twitter accounts. Patrick Green, of the charity Ben Kinsella Trust, said: It’s really important to take knives off the streets. Some of the work the politan Police have been doing extends beyond stop and search - we know that they are now doing sweeps of parks and public areas. That’s really an important piece of work for us because we know that habitual kne carriers who are fearful of being stopped will place knives in locations so they can go to that location and retrieve them so the work being done by the police there is really welcomed. We have also seen that they are doing a lot of those searches in conjunction with members of the public or community groups so there is a sense of helping other members of the community support to them in their work.  That’s good because local people have a lot of intelligence about where things might be hidden. Targeted use of stop and search done in an intelligence led way we are happy with - it’s an important police tactic. We are really pleased to see the police take a proactive stance however as good as the measures the police take are, they will not on their own solve the kne crime problem. Part of the issue we have got to address is the step before someone carries a kne. Preventative work and early intervention is as important as everything the police do. Dr Mark Prince runs the The Kiyan Prince Foundation, which works with young people to end violence. His son Kiyan, , was stabbed to death on May , , receiving a single lethal kne wound as he intervened to stop the bullying of another teen.   Dr Prince said: Work like this does make a dference because every area has to be responsible for the part that they play and for enforcing the law. You could have been on the way to using that kne and because you’ve been caught you’ve saved a le, so there is sense behind the enforcement and we need that. It’s collective - everybody needs to be doing their part. MP Stephen Timms, who was stabbed at one of his constituency surgeries in May , added: I’m pleased the Met is putting so much emphasis on confiscating knives. But we also need to stop people getting them in the first place. That means tackling the online s which supply them.

Kaylah Merritt, who is just one year old, was hospitalised for four days last month after a relative kissed her on the lips while they had a cold sore. She soon developed an awful purple rash all over her body and was left crying in pain. Her parents Brogan Thomas and Connor Merritt, both , rushed her to Darlington Memorial Hospital for emergency treatment.  Kaylah, from Staindrop, Darlington, County Durham, was diagnosed with Eczema Herpeticum, a viral infection caused by the herpes virus, and needed two rounds of antibiotics and several dferent creams to soothe her skin.Her parents are now urging adults to be aware of the risks kissing a baby on the mouth can bring after doctors said the tots experience could have been fatal.Stay-at-home mum-of-one Brogan said: Kaylah was crying so hard, I knew it could only mean she was in pain. We were at home and I was about to put her in the bath when I suddenly saw all the marks on her legs.It was an awful nightmare, there were purple rashes everywhere and Kaylah was sobbing her heart out.Eczema herpeticum is an infection usually caused by the herpes simplex  virus, which is usually responsible for the appearance of cold sores on the mouth or other parts of the body.People with atopic dermatitis and other skin diseases are more prone to getting infected, and the condition is more common among infants and young children.Symptoms include blisters, high fever and swollen lymph glands and can be proven deadly in some cases.   I was terried, my first thought was it had something to do with meningitis because she had it before.My fiance was petried, but he kept me calm and made sure Kaylah was calm too.I instantly knew we had to take her to the hospital.The doctors told us that someone with a cold sore must have kissed her on the lips and because babies immune systems are not strong enough, she developed the rash.When the doctors told me how dangerous it was I cried and cried thinking how I could have lost her due to a silly kiss.Connor was shocked and couldnt believe all this was down to a kiss too.If we hadnt gone to the hospital quickly, it could have been very dangerous, we could have lost her.I was so relieved when Kaylah was out of danger.Kaylah previously survived meningitis and needed a lumbar puncture to survive.This time, doctors told her parents the Eczema Herpeticum could have been very dangerous so it was lucky she was brought into hospital when she was.Kaylah was able to go back home after four days on a ward but her parents said she still hasnt fully recovered. Even a month later, she still needs to take daily medication until the virus is gone and must attend doctors appointments on a weekly basis.Brogan said: I am over the moon Kaylahs home now and enjoying herself with her toys and extra cuddles.I just want other parents to know, you dont have to be a physically ill to harm a baby - you can just be a carrier of the virus and still affect them."},{"url":null,"title":"travelodge digger driver pictured family","story":"NewsTravelodge digger driver pictured for first time as family reveal his real battleJohn Manley, , is now being treated for mental health issues after allegedly ploughing the construction vehicle into a newly built branch of the budget hotel in LiverpoolShareCommentsByJonathan HumphriesDanya BazaraaNews Reporter:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsJohn Manley, , who is being treated in hospital for mental health issues \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis is the first picture of the digger driver who crashed into a Travelodge hotel in a rampage. John Manley, , is nowbeing treatedfor mental health issues after allegedly ploughing the construction vehicle into a newly built Travelodge branch of the budget hotel over unpaid wages. Footage of the incident, which left the hotel front in Edge Lane destroyed, went viral after being filmed by other workers on the site. The rampage appeared to have been triggered after Mr Manleys pound wages were allegedly not paid on time by sub-contracting firm MF Constructions. Yesterday his cousin, Jason Pellegrini, , revealed Mr Manley had been seeking mental health treatment for a number of weeks.Today, his cousin reiterated that rumours circulating claiming the driver had actually been paid but had not checked his bank balance were .  In a new statement to the Liverpool Echo, Mr Pellegrini said: I would just like to stress what I stated in my local paper and clear something up.John Manley did not get paid on Monday, I know this as he does not have a bank account as he did not have the necessary identication, his wages, when paid, go into a family members account. This was checked on Monday and there was pound donated by a friend.If, as has been reported, there was an alleged glitch in the system, why would the boss refuse to answer any calls or messages which John left   Should he not explain this to his workers who break their back in a physically demanding job and just want a honest wage  We would like to highlight the fact again we do not condone Johns actions for the simple fact someone could have been seriously injured or worse pay disputes can be handled in dferent ways. Potentiallythe unions had more power it could be resolved that way, however I doubt that will happen whilst we have the muppets in charge of our country. His cousin yesterday said the huge strain on mental health services in the local area meant Mr Manley failed to receive adequate help.  Mr Pellegrini said: Hes had a very, very bad le. Hes not an angel we dont want to portray him as an angel... We have been trying to get him help but theres such a long waiting list. Its not down to the health care professionals but its a lack of resources. We are not condoning what he did at all someone could have been seriously hurt and hes not a national hero like some people have been making out. He is very troubled and its something when he has had to do what he did to get the kind of help he needs. He told me he does not want any money, he just wants his mates to get paid and he wants to get well.  He added that Mr Manley had traumatic childhood and only worked sporadically. It was claimed that Mr Manley was sleeping on a relatives couch inMerseyside in the lead up to the incident and was desperate after his employer MF Construction, allegedly failed to pay his pound wages. Mr Pellegrini said: He would ring the GP at am when it opens, and there would already be  people in the waiting line for an appointment. We wanted to get him a to a psychiatrist in Crosby but the waiting list is so long. I know he was technically of no fixed abode and could not claim benefits, so when he didnt work he literally had nothing. He had no money for gas, electric or food. According to Mr Pellegrinis account, neither his boss or his employer would answer the phone. I think in the end he just snapped. He said to me he would not have done ithed had an explanation.  Triton Construction, the main contractor for the Travelodge site, revealed there was no structural damage to the site. Michael Parkinson, managing director of Triton, said: It is our understanding that one of the labourers working for MF Construction, who were employed as the groundworks contractor for the project, had been waiting for his boss to arrive with his wages, which he told other workers on site were overdue. It is alleged that the labourer couldn’t track down the owner of MF Construction and he became increasingly frustrated. At approximately .pm the labourer took it upon himself to drive a small mini excavator through the entrance screen of the hotel and subsequently caused damage to finishes within the reception. The labourer then ran from the scene and to our knowledge is being pursued by the police. Fortunately there appears to be no structural damage so repairs can be undertaken relatively quickly. “ Merseyside Police confirmed they located a man as part of the investigation into the incident, but stated he is not under arrest.

Hannah Taylor grew up with “scary” stories about childbirth from her own mum and wanted a serene experience for her son Koa. The -year-old yoga teacher decided the best option for her and her son - now aged three months - was a freebirth without a medical attendant or professional present. Hannah and her partner Tyler Couchman welcomed lb oz baby Koa in an outdoor bath with no-one telling her to push, describing it as an incredible, blissful, experience. Just Tyler and best friend Shea Zamarra were in attendance. Hannah, from the US city of Sacramento, Calornia, said: “My mum had traumatic births with me and my sister and it didn’t sit well with me. “Growing up I had only heard scary stories of birth and when I heard about my friend’s experience with unassisted birth. It felt right to me.  “A unassisted birth is one without medical intervention. You give birth unhindered and without medical interference.“No one telling you when to push, you just completely listen to your own body. “During my pregnancy I did a lot of research and I read a lot of books. I listened to podcasts focused on women and their unassisted birthing stories.  She added: “I went into labour in early morning at about am on October  and my active contractions started around .am. “I was just home with my partner and my best friend Shea. I hadn’t planned to move to the outside to the tub, I just wanted to use it as somewhere to take a break during labour. “I was on the floor of my room when I decided to move outside to the tub. It is connected to the warm water mains from our house.  “It was an incredible, blissful, experience and I was ecstatic. Meeting my little boy for the first time was incredible.” Hannah and her sister, Jessica Taylor, were born by Caesarean section which left her keen to explore other options during her own pregnancy. Unassisted birth is the process of having a baby without the presence of a medical attendant or professional, which Hannah believed was the best option for her family. Hannahs partner Tyler, , a chef, added: So far it was the most amazing experience of my le. I had never heard of free birth before, but catching my son in my arms was the most amazing thing. Holding him brought tears to my eyes. It felt like a dream.  While Hannah’s birth was unassisted, the mum did attend regular prenatal appointments with a midwe to make sure her pregnancy was healthy.

The sisters, who had been living in the US for two to three years, were found dead on the banks of New Yorks Hudson River last October.Their bodies were discovered tied together at the waist and lying in an area where you would essentially walk right into the water.Now, it has emerged that they died by drowning.In a statement released yesterday, New York Chief Medical Examiner Dr Barbara Sampson also said the siblings had committed suicide.  “Today, my office determined that the death of the Farea sisters was the result of suicide, in which the young women bound themselves together before descending into the Hudson River, she said.Dr Sampson added that Rotana and Tala were among around  known suicides across the city in , according to PEOPLE. The sisters had been living roughly  miles away, in Virginia, and were wearing similar clothing when they entered the Hudson.As well as black leggings and fur-trimmed jackets, they were found bound together with duct tape, a press conference heard last year.  New York Police Department Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea said they were tied at the waist in a way that was keeping them together.But he said the tape wasnt meant to restrain them, CNN reports.The siblings were said to have likely entered the water alive. Their bodies were discovered by a horried passerby on October .Officials initially believed the pair may have committed suicide by leaping off George Washington Bridge, near the scene.But they were found to have no signs of trauma that would suggest such a fall - and experts later concluded they had drowned.  Sources in Virginia told detectives the sisters would rather inflict harm on themselves and commit suicide thanto Saudi Arabia. Detectives used eyewitness testimonies, video evidence and the eldest sisters credit card purchases for food, hotel and transportation to determine that there was likely no foul play involved in the deaths. The two had been last seen by family in Virginia in November . They subsequently stayed at a shelter facility for domestic violence victims until the end of August, according to reports.   They apparently arrived in New York City on September  before staying at a number of high-end hotels, Det Shea said. According to police, Rotana and Tala had allegedly been subjected to physical abuse and may have applied for US asylum. A Saudi official denied claims that the country ordered the sisters and their mum, who lives in the US, tothere.If you need to speak to someone, Samaritans are available   by calling   or by emailing jo@samaritans.org "},{"url":null,"title":"bride demands pick sister laws","story":"NewsBride demands to pick sister-in-laws wedding outfit - for outrageous reasonThe bride has made two requests about her sister-in-laws outfit for her wedding day - even though one of them will make her feel very uncomfortableShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  JAN NewsThe bride has made two demands\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has labelled her sister-in-law a bridezilla after she made a number of outrageous demands about her wedding outfit.

Those who chose breast milk can be faced with several issues - especiallythey struggle to produce their own. Thankfully the internet has a solution for this. For years generous women have been offering up their spare breast milk for babies in need via social media and websites. But while this act of kindness may bring about joy, it can sometimes also be a bit bizarre. One unnamed woman recently saw the darker side of her charitable actions, after a mum contacted her to ask for some of her milk.  The conversation between the two began civilly, as the mum messaged the woman to askshe could donate some milk to her. In screen shots of their chat shared on Imgur, we can see that the woman is more than willing to give away her milk, she responds asking how old the little one is and asks how much she requires. The mum reveals that her son is almost two-years-old and eats a lot. She subsequently offers to take it all off the womans hands.  The woman, who has her own six-week-old daughter, says she can spare about  ounces of milk for her fellow parent. I can spare about  ounces todayyou can pick up. My girl is only six weeks old so Im reserving most of the milk for a baby her age or any preemies in need in the Facebook group. However the other mum isnt impressed by her offer and asks for more. She replied: Lol... ounces  He eats like almost  a day. Thats only like  days worth. [Friends name] said you make tonnes of milk so I was hoping you could give a bit more. Hes got a sensitive stomach and breast milk is one of the few things his little tummy can handle.  He was a preemie too. The woman remains levelheaded with her reply and kindly tells the mum shell see how much she has left over after the rest has been claimed as shes donating with the intention of helping out an infant preemie. Her answer adds fuel to the fire and outraged the mum sends off another message. It reads: Dont understand why you cant just give it to me  Why does it have to be a preemie My boy was a preemie and he is a baby in need.   The woman stands her ground, reminding the mum that her son is no longer a baby and doesnt actually need any breast milk. No offence but your kid is a toddler, not a baby who needs exclusive breast milk. Ive offered you what I can spare already and am happy to see how much I have left over after donating the majority this weekend, she said. Im happy to send you a message to let you know. Realising shes not going to get what she wants, the mum decides to turn nasty and lashes out. The conversation ends with her writing: Whatever b****, keep your sour milk. Its probably tainted with booze and painkillers. Feel sorry for whichever poor kid ends up with it.

Her -year-old mum was attacked on the last night of their holiday in the Italian seaside resort of Meta di Sorrento, south of Naples, when her drink was allegedly spiked. The court heard how the gang of workers were caught by cops after sharing sick videos of the attack on an online chat group.  She was on holiday with her daughter and was so shocked she didnt tell cops what happened until she ed home to the UK. Her daughter broke down in tears as she told the court in nearby Torre Annunziata: My mum seemed distant and far away.She broke down in tears at the airport as we were leaving and told me everything that happened. We had dinner at the hotel restaurant and shared a bottle of wine. We were with another couple of holidaymakers.  The staff at the restaurant were very polite. Then one of the barmen offered my mother and I drink in some shot glasses. One of them had a tattoo on his neck. They invited us to the bar for a drink after we finished our dinner. I remember having a drink and then almost immediately feeling sick.I went to the toilet and threw up. I was there for a while and when I came back my mum had disappeared. Prosecutors say the victim was taken to a room close to the swimming pool where she was raped several times by the men before stumbling back to her room at the Hotel Alimuri.  The woman reported the attack to cops when she ed to the UK, and DNA samples and drug tests were sent to Italian investigators. They revealed a high level of the sedative benzodiazepines but lawyers for the five defendants claim the victim was on tranquillisers following the death of her husband.

One bathing house in the town was even built exclusively for Joseph Stalin. But after the USSR collapsed in the early s, the stream of socialist visitors started to dry up and the once grand buildings were left to be reclaimed by time and nature.  Eerie images taken by photographer Roman Robroek show deserted arcades with columns topped by crumbling turquoise arches - that open onto balconies with views of the woods beyond.And wide stone staircases spiral down to the now empty bathing pools, where the ceramic tiles barely cling to the walls.

Nara Dreamland was built in , complete with fairytale castles, rollercoasters and other attractions. But the park struggled to compete when both Disney and Universal Studios opened up their own parts in nearby Osaka and Tokyo. The park was eventually closed in the summer of , but its attractions were left in place for over  years to rust and decay.

Houtouwan, China  Built on the steep hills of Shengshan Island, , fishermen once plied their trade in the village of Houtouwan in China. But thousands of inhabitants moved from the island, one of  islands on the Shengsi archipelago, in the early s, seeking better education, jobs and healthcare. They left only a small handful of residents still living there, and today even that group has dwindled to almost nobody.  Last year stunning pictures emerged from the village showing how it is being reclaimed by nature.

But after the Soviet Union fell in  the bunkers were sealed shut or demolished.One near Dundee, however, was preserved exactly how it was when it was last entered at least  years ago.  Explorers who recently entered the secret site for the first time found old pots and pans, mugs, and washing up liquid alongside official Cold War communications technology. The bunker, built ft under the ground, and housed two people when it was operational, still has the original desk, cabinets and bunk beds that would have been used by volunteers. Blankets were filmed rotting on the bunk bed exactly where they had been left decades ago, and there is even a candle holder with the remains of a burned-out candle stuck in the base.

They were seen with the toothy beast loaded in the back of a boat, which was being carried on a truck, to Cecil Park, in the west of the city, on Sunday. Footage of the incident went viral online, with many people questioning the decision to transport the shark they way they did.   One of the men, Nathan Struck, said: We definitely werent showing off. The shark was enormous and just physically too big to fit into the car door. The clip was uploaded to the TeamBaitcatcher Facebook page and received mixed comments. One praised their work, saying: Absolute Legends and the Mako actually looked like he was enjoying the ride.   While another was more concerned about the shark, adding: Nice fish and well done but why be a bunch of flogs and hang it out the back of the boat. The fishermen confirmed they would cut up and share out the meat to their four familes.

It wasn’t good when we lost.“That feeling is one you don’t want again and results like that one just show you can’t take anything for granted.“Teams in Scotland in all the leagues have good players and,you don’t have the proper approach, you will have problems.”And Stanton expects Montrose to battle tooth and nail to cause a shock tomorrow but believes United will be ready to cope with that.“These are dficult games because you know one team is giving everything they can to beat you because they have that nothing-to-lose mentality about them.“I’ve been there myself in those cup-ties when I was with Dumbarton, where you play teams who are bigger than your club and you don’t normally play against.“It excites you and it’s a chance for you to show how good you are. It’s why,you’re the bigger team, you can never take these games for granted.”He believes the key to avoiding a shock is treating the opposition with the respect they deserve and working towards the tie asit was a big game.“We have prepared for this one like we do every other game and that makes sure you have the right attitude.“The manager has had his videos of Montrose and been telling us about their strengths and weaknesses.“That way you make sure you are going into the game with the right mentality.”And,promotion from the Championship this term is by far the No  goal, Stanton admits he would love to go as far as possible in the cup.“A cup run is always important for the supporters and we know that.“For the players as well, it’s nice to do well and, as a football club, it is always important that we go as far as we can in the cup.“It’s another game we want to win and,you can string some wins together in the league and add a cup run to that as well, it’s always a help.”Stanton is also well aware that a side story tomorrow will be Tangerines legend Sean Dillon coming up against them for the first time since he ended a -year stay at Tannadice in .He expects the man who won the cup with United in  to get a rousing welcome from Arabs but, once that is out of the way and the game kicks off, it will be business as usual.“Sean left before I arrived at United but I know what a good player he was for the club.“He was here a long time and I’m sure he will get a good reception from our fans who travel up there.“For us, it’s about making sure he’s not the one getting clapped off the pitch after the game has finished.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c45bd0ec386d0.62163534.jpg ","title":"jim mcintyre relieved as dundee remain in scottish cup","story":"Dundee boss Jim McIntyre was relieved to still be in the Scottish Cup after his side scraped a draw with Queen of the South at Dens Park.Saturday’s fourth-round clash saw the Doonhamers deservedly move ahead through veteran striker Stephen Dobbie’s rd goal of the campaign.Although Jesse Curran struck a fine equaliser at the end of the first half, it was to prove the Dark Blues only shot on target over the  minutes.It was down to the heroics of debut keeper Seny Dieng, on loan from QPR for the rest of the season, that McIntyre’s men can look forward to a replay at Palmerston next week.And Jim conceded they were outplayed for much of the  minutes by the visitors.However, on a day of shock results that saw Motherwell and Ayr United go down to lower level opposition, Aberdeen held at home by Stenhousemuir and St Mirren having to battle back from two goals down against Alloa to edge through, being in the hat for the fth-round draw was a consolation.It will see Dundee face the Dons or Stenny away –they can come through the second game.“I thought Queen of the South were better than us.

For him, the bottom line is Dundee should have been better than this.“It was very frustrating on Saturday. I think our performance first half, we should be thankful we are still in the cup really,” he said.“It wasn’t good enough. They’ve got the goal to go ahead and then Jesse has done brilliantly just before half-time to get it back and have us level.“It was a good time for us to score and then we did definitely play better in the second half. On the whole, though, it was not good enough.“I suppose it does happen in the cup, we saw that with some of the other results, and the big thing is we are still in there and have a replay where we can make it into the next round.“So we maybe shouldn’t be too hard on ourselves over it but we’re still not happy with the performance.”Like most players after a bad game, now the -year-old just wants to get out on a pitch again and try to put things right.That’s why he breathed a sigh of relief on Sunday when Hearts’ televised clash with Livingston produced a result.Had the Jambos not edged past the Lions, a replay would have been tonight and Dundee’s Premiership visit to Tynecastle would have been postponed.“We have another game right away and that’s good. The one thing we didn’t want was no game this week because Hearts had drawn their cup-tie.“The thing you want to do after the winter break is get back into playing regularly again right away and you don’t want to be missing games because of things like that. You want to get points on the board as soon as possible.”Turning to the subject of the new arrivals, Ralph believes they will signicantly boost the chances of top-flight survival.So far, he’s been impressed by what he’s seen.He added: “I thought the new lads looked sharp and direct. They definitely want to get on the ball, create and make things happen.“I think them coming in this month will be good for the squad and they are going to help us going forward.”"},{"url":null,"title":"one in and one out for dundee united as goalkeeper signs from hibs","story":"Dundee United have signed goalkeeper Ross Laidlaw on loan from Hibs as Matej Rakovan departs the club.The Tangerines have sealed a loan deal until the end of the season for the -year-old after releasing Slovakian goalie Rakovan with  months remaining on his contract.Laidlaw has played  times for the Hibees, winning the Championship in  in the process, and will challenge with Benjamin Siegrist for the gloves at Tannadice.Manager Robbie Neilson said: “Ross joins us to compete for the first-team goalkeeping position.#He brings important experience having won this championship with Hibs and most importantly is an excellent goalkeeper.#I have been looking to improve the competition within the goalkeeping set-up, and I am happy to see Ross here.“Rakovan played  times for the Tangerines, keeping one clean sheet."},{"url":null,"title":"readers panel tell us what you think of the tele and you can win 50","story":"The Eveningwants to know what YOU think – and you could even receive a cash reward.Join the Tele’s Reader Panel – a sounding board of trusted readers – to let us know, through short and simple online surveys, what you think of our content.All the answers are vital to us, helping us to provide the kind of paper you want to read.What’s more, for each survey you complete you will be entered into a free monthly prize draw, with three lucky lists each winning £.It really is that simple.Tele editor Dave Lord said he wanted to hear from readers, however they consume the news – be it a copy of the newspaper or online through your mobile or tablet.“This is the perfect opportunity for you, as a reader of the Tele, to tell us what you think and have your say on our future,” he continued.“Please be assured that input from readers is crucial in shaping our content, from news and sport to features.

It gave everyone with a liking for the Tangerines a lt.So, too, did a dramatic shrinking of the seven-point gap at the top of the Championship courtesy of Neilson’s team taking four points from consecutive home games, while top two Ross County and Ayr United each lost two in a row.That means, for a few hours at least, United can join leaders County on the -point markthey win the second tier’s game of the weekend at Ayr on Friday night.They would, of course, still trail the Staggies, who have a vastly superior goal dference, but just being up there would be another boost.A win would also cancel out the game in hand Ayr hold over United, though they too have a better goal dference. And whatever happens at Somerset Park, Ian McCall’s team will be above themthey beat Inverness next midweek.Perhaps, though, the biggest benefit to United this weekend can be the type of performance that, whatever the points, makes a statement that they’re the ones to beat. That, unfortunately, is something they’ve largely failed to do in three seasons down in the Championship.Past glories, some of them recent, mean United start every campaign as favourites for promotion.And any team walking into Tannadice on a Saturday sees a club geared for football in the Premiership.Too often, however, any edge that’s given United has disappeared because of performances.Even when they’ve lost, in the last two-and-a-half years sides have come out of games against them feeling reputation and expectation have not matched the sum of the parts of the team they’ve faced.Results like two defeats away to Dumbarton the season before last, a - loss at Falkirk last term and two five-goal home losses in this campaign, have led to opposition throughout the ision believing they always have a chance when facing United.In truth, even the draw with Partick Thistle this month and the win over Dunfermline that closed the gap at the top to those three points, were not as convincing as was expected.That’s repeatedly been the case during the two failed attempts to get up. In the big games, too often United have come up short.They did beat Hibs at Tannadice near the end of  but lost heavily to them soon after and quickly dropped off the pace at the top.Andthey won twice at Tannadice against last season’s table toppers St Mirren, the first time came before the Buddies were regarded as their main rivals and the second after Jack Ross’s team were out of sight at the top.This time round, the best so far came up in Dingwall in November when County were beaten -.Without taking anything away from that success, after Paul Watson’s early goal put them ahead, the three points were secured via a gritty rearguard action.Yes, it was the kind of performance that is needed at times in a successful league campaign.So, too, do emphatic victories that tell the rest of the league you are a team to be feared. There would be no better time for such a statement than Friday in Ayrshire."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"dennys-bosses-slam-unforgiving-customers-after-being-bombarded-with-terrible-reviews","story":"DENNYrsquoS bosses have hit back at ldquounforgiving customers who have left negative feedback after visiting the dinerrsquos newly-opened branch near Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-subway-incident-at-west-street-mean-services-suspended","story":"UPDATE:Man dead after being hit by train on Glasgow Subway during rush-hour.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 9","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDrawn on Monday January , Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery numbers were ,  and .

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13896898.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS171494552.jpg","title":"coventry city signing michael rose","story":"NewsCoventry City signing Michael Rose can be future Scotland star, says Ayr United boss Ian McCallThe Ayr United centre half has completed a pre contract switch to the Ricoh Arena and will join the Sky Blues in the summer.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsMichael Rose, left, in action for Ayr United \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIan McCall reckons Coventry have bagged themselves a future Scotland star in Michael Rose.

Everyone talks about Lawrence but, in my opinion, Michael Rose could go on to achieve just as much -not more -he wants to.  He is that good a player and Ive no doubt he can be a future Scotland international. For my money hes been the best centre half in the Championship this season. Of course wed have loved to keep him, but we have to be realistic. Rose is one of a number of players to reinvent their careers under McCall following his failure to break through as a youth at Aberdeen. And McCall said: It is further proof to boys thatthey come here and develop themselves, they will get their reward. Michael is an outstanding player with a very bright future and we wish him all the best.

And the shining star of the region’s education system confesses she is now “living in a bubble waiting for it to burst”. Gaenor, who joins Heathfield after heading up Dalmilling Primary for five years, said: “I was very happy there and only Heathfield would have pulled me away. “It is always the school I have aspired to. My twins came here and I feel that level of affinity. “All I see is potential. I’ve never been at a school where the surroundings in the community are so rich.” Gaenor cut her teaching teeth in south London before ing north after her sister suffered a severe stroke, aged just . She said: “It made me review my le and decide what was important so we relocated back up to Scotland. “I’ve been back here for  years now and always had one eye on Heathfield as I knew it was such an exciting job. “Part of that excitement is that I live in the catchment and my children went here so it feels like coming home. “But I’m also excited about making this the flagship school. “However, we also need to make this the hub of the local community.” Fitness fanatic Gaenor admits an “open and frank exchange of views” took place during the first meeting with her new parent council last week. It follows concerns over the previous management’s approach to alleged bullying within the school. But she insisted: “I’m all for honest, vibrant and lively dialogue. “None of it was a surprise to me as a parent myself. “I would hate to think I’ll be a comparison to previous management in the school. “What I can bring is my own unique experience to the role. “I want to be open and visible and have parents approach me. “This has to be us together on the journey.” And she added: “I don’t have to grow a passion for the school. It is there within me already. “I feel like I’m in a bubble of looking forward to coming to work and being so motivated – and I’m still waiting for it to be burst.” Now Gaenor, who is often seen walking to school, is planning to get her pupils into shape as part of a new physical and mental drive. She said: “If I want the children to be fit and healthy then I have to model that. “Health and wellbeing has to underpin everything we’re doing. “The local junor parkrun is an example of something I’d like to see encouraged. “We’ve also rolled out more than  after-school and lunch clubs from this month. “I’ll be doing a homework club and the clerical team are doing a running club so we’re all very hands on. “But ultimately the children are my inspiration. “We have a fantastic new building in which to work and I’ve never experienced anything like it during my career. “Now the challenge is to make the most of it and enjoy what we have.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"new super school riddled structural","story":"NewsNew super-school is riddled with structural problemsLeaks, faulty automatic doors and sensory lights are among a string of issues at Invergarven’s marquee campus in Girvan.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsInside the school \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new pound million super-school is “riddled” with structural problems, it can been revealed.

I had a lot of balls left because Georgie loved them and my other dog doesnt so I put them in the box at the Gattonside end of chain bridge.\"Since then someone has attached it to the gate and people have been borrowing the balls and putting them back and even adding new ones.\"I just want the box to remind owners to enjoy every moment with their dog.\"Georgie passed away in May last year after contracting Alabama rot, also known as Cutaneous and Renal Glomerular Vasculopathy .Only appearing to affect dogs, the disease damages the lining of blood vessels in the skin and kidney, resulting in ulceration of the skin and kidney damage.The condition can affect any breed or age of dog and a proportion can go on to develop severe, acute kidney failure, which is often fatal.Lynsay and her dogs Georgie and Taffy used to walk along the river most days and it was after one of these walks that she noticed Georgie had lesions on her legs.\"It was after a walk in Gattonside one Saturday that I saw that she had sores on her legs so I took her to the vet on Monday and she was given some cream.\"But she went downhill fast and by Wednesday her poo was black, which I later learnt was a sign that her kidneys were failing.\"I took her to the vets again where she was given a cone to stop her licking the sores but by Friday the vets suspected it was Alabama rot and put her on a drip and kept her in overnight hoping that she would improve.\"But on Saturday we were told that her kidneys had stopped working and she wasnt going to get better.\"I took Taffy with me to spend some time with her and then she got put to sleep.\"Alabama rot was first recorded in the UK in  and the number of cases has risen each year. Georgies was the first confirmed case in the Borders.Lynsay said: \"The only way that you can be sure it is Alabama rot is to have a post mortem so Georgie was then taken to the Dick Vet in Edinburgh where it was confirmed that she had had Alabama rot. My other dog was tested for it but thankfully the results were clear.\"The Kennel Club is warning dog owners to be extra vigilant at this time of year as the peak season for the disease is between November and May.Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary said: ldquoAlthough the disease is very rare, affecting an extremely low percentage of dogs in the UK, the condition is very serious and potentially le-threatening. It is therefore vital that owners understand and recognise the warning signs, especially as time plays a signicant part in successfully treating the disease.ldquoWe are asking owners to look out for any signs of Alabama rot during the winter months and to remember to take action right away. Any dogs with unexplained or concerning skin lesions which typically look like sores, ulcers, or red, swollen, bruised areas, commonly with an infected appearance should be taken to their vet as soon as possible. These skin changes are usually found on their paws or lower legs, but may also appear on their head, face or lower body. Dogs who have contracted the disease may also become tired, disinterested in food, or present other signs of illness like vomiting or diarrhoea.ldquoAlthough these signs may not necessarily mean your dog has Alabama rot, acting quickly and speaking to a vet to determine what is wrong is the best course of action to protect your petrsquos health.While large amounts of research have been carried out over the last six years, the cause of the disease remains unknown. As yet, no evidence has been found to suggest that CRGV is caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins, or radiation. There is speculation that it is related to mud or water, due to the higher prevalence in winter and spring, and relatively low case numbers seen in the summer.Caroline continued: ldquoTo lower any risk of your dog contracting Alabama rot, itrsquos also advisable to keep your dog away from very muddy areas, wash wet or muddy dogs straight after a walk and regularly check your dogrsquos body for anything thatrsquos dferent.,params: .pushldquoWhile a distinct seasonal pattern is suggested, we must continue to research this deadly disease and ensure all dog owners are aware of the signs and symptoms so they are able to seek veterinary advice immediately.Despite what happened, Lynsay still s to walk Taffy along the river in Gattonside.

This apple is magic and is found at the top of a tall ancient tree, which grows deep in a dark forest.ldquoTo get to the tree first you must find your way through the forest. Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"communities-chance-to-take-charge-of-their-local-halls-and-centres","story":"East Lothian Council has identied six community buildings which it believes could be run by local residents.It says the move would be carried out as part of its Community Asset Transferproject, which is looking for new ways to run some of its facilities, including handing them to local groups to run or take over ownership.Six potentially suitable buildings will be offered to communities this month, with a three-month deadline for local groups to submit notes of interest.They are: East Linton Council Chamber, Gullane Recreation Hall, Macmerry Village Hall, Prestonpans Town Hall, Stoneyhill Community Centre in Musselburgh, and Trevelyan Hall in Pencaitland.Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: ldquoThere are a number of community facilities and village halls in East Lothian which are already managed successfully by volunteer members of the local community.ldquoCommittees often cover running costs through the income they receive, with a ied programme of events taking place at the heart of the local community.ldquoWe believe that giving communities the opportunity to take an enhanced role has the potential to increase the usage and vibrancy of the facilities and also increase income to help cover running costs.And he added: ldquoCommunity organisations may be able to access external funding sources to help make the venues increasingly successful.The council will be engaging with local groups and inviting interested parties to get in touch as it looks for ways to transfer the buildings back to the communities.It has already held meetings with community councils and area partnerships.Mr Goodfellow said: ldquoThis supports the council in making increasingly efficient use of resources.ldquoIt enables us to continue working in partnership with local communities towards realising our vision for an even more prosperous, safe and sustainable East Lothian.Recommendations for the future of the buildings will be made following the end of the consultation period."},{"url":null,"title":"were-sorry-scotrail-offers-compensation-for-unacceptable-service-on-north-berwick-line","story":"The Haymarket to North Berwick line is one of those whose season ticket holders qualy for the special compensation as a result of it being one of the worst affected by recent train crew shortages.As an apology, ScotRail is offering season ticket holders free travel on six specied weekends in the spring.There is no need for season ticket holders to apply for the offer.A statement on ScotRails website from Alex Hynes, managing director of ScotRail Alliance, said: \"We are very sorry to ScotRail customers for our unacceptable service in parts of the country recently.\"While our teams work hard every day to deliver the service you demand, the reality is that wersquove fallen below the standard you expect and deserve.\"While it doesnrsquot excuse what has happened, here are the challenges we have faced:\"We are working flat out to train conductors and drivers on Scotlandrsquos railway so that we canservices to normal.\"Since December  we have trained  drivers and conductors, so we have made progress, but we know we need to do more.\"We are training more than  drivers and conductors every day throughout January and February toyour service to levels you deserve.\"We have seen the level of cancellations reduce steadily over the last few weeks.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

My own wish would be for MPs to seize the moment and vote to revoke Article  altogether. MPs have the power to stop the clock for good, thanks to the good works of legally-minded MPs like the SNPrsquos Joanna Cherry.Staying in the EU is the only sure way to stop the endless arguments about Canada plus, Norway plus, customs union, Irish backstop, regulatory alignment, maximum facilitation and all the rest of the gubbins thatrsquos been occupying our addled brains for the last two-and-a-half years. However, this isnrsquot going to happen.And Irsquod have to agree that it would be undemocratic for MPs to simply reverse the result of the  referendum by revoking A. It may be that Parliament has the power and the constitutional right to do so: referendums are only advisory. But it would leave so much unpleasantness that British politics would be soured for decades. There would have to be a referendum.This is where my unease turns to genuine anxiety. I have a horrible feeling that Labourrsquos Diane Abbott was right on Question Time this week when she said: ldquoBe careful what you wish for. She agrees with Nigel Farage that a repeat referendum is likely to endorse no-deal Brexit, perhaps by an even greater margin than in .Evenit left us with a mirror-image result, with say % Remain against % Leave, that would itself be a disaster because it would have no legitimacy. Yes, some opinion polls say Remain would win a comfortable majority, but they said that last time.The Brexiteers are already field-testing their slogans on social media. The frontrunner is ldquoTell Them Again, which may not be as resonant as ldquoTake Back Control but is still pretty hot. It surfs on the very widespread disgust and alienation that many ordinary people feel about the political elite. It appeals to democratic injustice: how dare the globalists ignore the result of , which David Cameron promised would be for keeps What would Remainrsquos slogan be  Itrsquos likely to be a repeat of the Project Fear line which failed dismally in . ldquoDonrsquot put your childrenrsquos prosperity at risk, perhaps, or ldquoThink Twice Think Jobs. But what many pro-Europeans fail to grasp ndash and this applied to the Unionists in the Scottish independence referendum ndash is that it ISNrsquoT the economy, stupid. Brexit voters donrsquot just make their decisions on the basis of economic rationality, as seen from the CBI and corporate Britain.People are always motivated more by emotion than numbers ndash on what they believe to be morally right. The sense that working-class people have lost control is a very potent mobiliser.As in war ndash and it is remarkable how much Brexit mythology harks back to World War Two ndash people are quite willing to sacrice some comfort for what they believe in.I may think they are mistaken. As with the people who supported Donald Trump because he promised to Make America Great Again, and bring back the jobs, I think Brexit voters have been sold a  prospectus by politicians who do not have the best interests of working people at their hearts.But that isnrsquot really the point. I can well understand the sense of injustice felt by people who have been left behind by global capitalism. They want to kick the system, and the referendum gave them a chance to do it. They need a very strong reason not to kick the metropolitans again. Only Labour can provide that reason, and Jeremy Corbyn has been singularly reluctant to do so.His refusal even to meet Theresa May was irresponsible in this climate. It may have allowed him to avoid coming off the fence, but it looked petty and weak. Corbyn should have gone in guns blazing, demanded that she drop the red lines, and then mobilised Labour for either rejoining the single market or for a referendum.Single market membership has always been the logic of Labourrsquos position, even though Corbyn usually refers to a ldquopermanent customs union. Only by joining the European Economic Area could Labour deliver friction-free trade, and protect environmental standards and workers rights. People say that Norway has blocked the UKrsquos entry to the European Economic Area, but this is not true. The Norwegian PM, Erna Solberg, has repeatedly made clear that Norway would have severe reservations ndashwho wouldnrsquot  ndash but would not block UK membership.This is because the EEA is essentially a Brussels creation. It was set up as a halfway house to membership of the EU back in  when a number of countries were uneasy about joining the political institutions of Europe. The EEA is just the European Single Market under another name.Brussels endorses British membership of the EEA, and this economic arrangement has a number of advantages over Mayrsquos deal. Therersquos no need for an Irish backstop no membership of the CAP and the Common Fisheries Policy no direct jurisdiction of the European Court and it costs less than EU membership. Of course, it does not bring the full benefits of EU membership. Britain would become a ldquorule taker on trade. But the EEA does not preclude future membership of the European Union. Norway, or any other member of the EEA, can opt for full membership at any time. And unlike the backstop, countries can leave the EEA after one year.Membership of the single market also means accepting freedom of movement, which is why it may well be rejected by Parliament. But it is the only option that has a snowballrsquos chance of getting a majority,Labour were to seriously support it. ldquoNorway plus, as itrsquos called, has more support than a repeat referendum. Fewer than  Labour MPs have called for a Peoples Vote, and only  Conservatives. The SNP has decided to throw its lot in with a repeat referendum, despite having argued convincingly for the single market for the last two years. But that isnrsquot enough.To repeat. Were it left to me, I would revoke Article  tomorrow. I just want this madness to stop. But given the metrics in Parliament, we have to look at the least worst options, as the Labour-supporting commentator Owen Jones put it last week. Mayrsquos deal is dead. MPs owe it to the country, and to themselves, to find some compromise that works. Perhaps that can only be achieved with a referendum. ButMPs fail this week, they risk destroying respect for parliamentary democracy, and opening the way for a more authoritarian form of political leadership."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-a-play-a-pie-and-a-pint-15-years-and-500-plays","story":"Chamberlain is auditioning later on, and she has  plays to cast.

This shows the range of material which has made its way onto Oran Morrsquos stage in a low-budget, low-risk way light-years away from a prevailing corporate philosophy of big-budget event-based shows.This includes revisiting the debut plays by David Ireland and Denise Mina, as well as favourite shows about comedian Chic Murray, Dusty Springfield and Fe-born darts player, Jocky Wilson. Irelandrsquos play, What The Animals Say, heralded a career which has seen one of his most recent plays, Cyprus Avenue, win numerous awards, while his Traverse Theatre hit, Ulster American, is about to tour to Australia and Ireland.

Chamberlain, meanwhile, co-founded production company The Comedy Unit, responsible for numerous much-loved TV sit-coms.While things have become more streamlined in terms of the day to day running of the company since the early days of PPP, all those involved since have nevertheless retained the sense of low-risk immediacy which MacLennan championed, and despite receiving Creative Scotland funding in a way it might have previously steered clear of, remains a small operation.ldquoOne of the great joys of A Play, A Pie and A Pint for the writers, says Fullarton, ldquois that your play can be on in three months, and it doesnrsquot have to hang around for a year waiting for lots of executive producers to make decisions.

Two-thirds said it was unfair to penalise those who have to travel before lower fares kick in, at am.ScotRail, which is run by Dutch firm Abellio, has been losing money.

That includes efforts to boost the number of seats by  per cent by the end of this year.The spokesman added: \"More widely, we are currently undertaking a review of the National Transport Strategy, which will consider our long-term approach to ensuring the affordability of transport across Scotland.\"David Sidebottom, director at the independent watchdog Transport Focus, called for reform of fare pricing.He said: \"We know just over a third of ScotRail commuters are satisfied with the value for money of their ticket. Despite substantial investment in new trains and track, many passengers have yet to consistently experience a more reliable railway with punctual trains, accurate information and less disruption.ldquoPassengers also want a smarter ticketing system that they can understand and trust, is simpler to use, better value for money and offers choices that suit the way we travel now.\"There are parallel reviews under way of Britains railways and their fares. Unions have been campaigning for Abellio to be stripped of its franchise - and for renationalisation.Transport Salaried Staffs Association General Secretary Manuel Cortes said, ldquoThis is a chance for Scotland to lead instead of trailing. Last year Michael Matheson said that it would cost Abellio poundmillion to freeze the fares.\"Well thatrsquos pennies compared to the poundbillion over ten years that the ScotRail contract is worth.ldquoPrivatisation isnrsquot working for the economy of Scotland.

The  information broadcast by the Brexiters was by no means a one-off occurrence.In  we were told that we were joining a trading group called the EEC and to a greater extent that is exactly what it was. Unfortunately, those in power in the UK whether blue or red did not see Europe as a positive. It became common policy to blame any unpopular action they took on the European Union. In this they were aided and abetted by the red tops and Little Englander press which enthusiastically printed their nonsense and made up their own as well . This swelled the ranks of voters who blindly blamed Europe for any perceived disadvantage they experienced. The logical result of this was the rise of racism and anti-Semitism.Westminster had no interest in working to mould the EU and was seen as a disruptive element standing on the outside throwing insults. The constant bitching about how much our contribution was masked the real net amount which our membership actually cost. The thing Westminster politicians hated was that money paid was ed as grants not to the south-east of England but to rural and regional areas, in which as we all know Westminster has very little interest.The cynical use of misinformation continued through the  Independence referendum and on to the European referendum. It continues today with Theresa May and Liam Fox making absurd statements about the ease of trade deals, nf which obviously Mr Mowbray has also been duped.

As he waited quietly, I could just about discern him counting out the seconds in his head. Without turning round to watch what was going on in these final moments of world-class culinary creation, he simply knew who was doing what and when. Everything came together when it should. The rhythm and harmony of Fairliersquos kitchen ndash the beating heart of Scotlandrsquos only two-Michelin starred restaurant within the Gleneagles Hotel ndash was palpable, and to witness Scotlandrsquos most celebrated chef at the very top of his game was a privilege Irsquoll never forget. I am grateful to him for this and the many subsequent memorable experiences he allowed me to share. Remembering him sitting youthfully cross-legged atop the scrubbed wooden kitchen table of his Glasgow flat, grinning widely with his hair boyishly tousled, for a photographer just after he got his first Michelin star for One Devonshire Gardens in , is particularly poignant.It was Andrewrsquos quiet demeanour and waspish sense of humour that endeared him to so many, not only within the Scottish, UK and international hospitality industries, but also in the fields of art, design and, most recently, horticulture. He was a great collaborator and mentor, and he certainly had a huge personal impact on many journalists, myself included.From my numerous accompanied visits to the Victorian walled kitchen garden in Perthshire he acquired in  after an unsuccessful second course of chemotherapy, it was abundantly clear that he adored it and regarded it as his ldquosalvation, both professional and personal. He loved the quiet energy of the many specimens being cultivated by head gardener Jo Campbell exclusively for his restaurant. ldquoItrsquos so dferent from the crazy energy of the kitchen, he said. ldquoThe garden is a very calming influence and I am sure it has had a beneficial effect. Despite the chemotherapy he never lost his sense of taste and the fresh produce had a galvanising effect on his menus, with dishes headlining the greenery in line with global culinary trends. He loved that diners would travel for miles to sample his take on the fruits of the Scottish terroir, and spent many happy hours with Jo and her team. When I got my allotment last August, I laughed out loud when he cautioned me wryly against letting it take up too much of my time. God knows I know now what he meant.I like to think his humility, which endured even after joining the international culinary elite as one of only a handful of Grands Chefs du Monde, was down to his upbringing in a modest council house in Letham, Perth, and leaving school at  with no qualications.

Marrying his beautul, loving long-term partner Kate White last November was, he told me, the ldquoicing on the cake.At the Michelin Star awards ceremony in London last October, he was using a walking stick with some dficulty but looked deliriously happy as, surrounded by Kate and his closest chef friends, Restaurant Andrew Fairlie retained its second star for the th consecutive year. He had words of encouragement for those Scots restaurant chefs who were left disappointed not to receive a star: ldquoIn the next couple of years Scotland will do really, really well, he said.The last time I saw him was when he invited me to his home just days before the wedding and some weeks after being discharged from the Beatson Cancer Centre in Glasgow. Struggling under the long-term effects of chemo followed by steroids to help correct his balance, he told me that his brain tumour - first diagnosed in  - had now entered the terminal stage. He wanted the world to know that though he was finally having to give up cooking, the Gleneagles Hotel had assured him that Restaurant Andrew Fairlie would continue with the same long-standing team under head chef Stevie McLaughlin, restaurant manager Dale Dewsbury and business manager Gregor Mathieson ndash whom he had worked with since the early days at One Devonshire Gardens. Over coffee at his home overlooking the Ochils, Andrew confided that hersquod been so worried his staff may be laid off and his restaurant given over to a dferent chef that hersquod had sleepless nights angsting about it. The relief at being immediately assured otherwise was, he said, ldquoa huge weight off my shoulders. Concern for others was an abiding characteristic, and engendered le-long loyalty.For his th birthday hersquod had plans to take his trusted tight-knit team to spend time with head chef Michel Guerard at Les Pres drsquoEugenie, the three-Michelin starred restaurant in south-west France where Andrew had worked at age  as the prize for winning the very first Roux Scholarship in . ldquoThatrsquos where it all began, hersquod said. ldquoReturning will be the final piece of the jigsaw. Though hersquod subsequently had to cancel that long-cherished trip, he bore the disappointment with a philosophical acceptance. ldquoI feel very peaceful, were among his last words to me.I cherish the notebook I used to record my most recent interviews with Andrew. He liked it because of the lobster design on the cover. I was pleased hersquod noticed, as Irsquod bought it on purpose: Andrewrsquos signature dish was home-smoked Scottish lobster with warm lime and herb butter.

Discussions on the future of the service were scheduled to take place in November but were delayed to allow extra time to take residentsrsquo views into account - proposed service changes have been amended as a result.Proposals to close the Insch Household Waste and Recycling Centrehave been removed as a result of public feedback. It is proposed that the centre would stay open two days a week, with the cost to be covered by slightly shortening opening hours at other recycling centres.Changes to kerbside services have also been proposed and, out of the two options consulted on, councillors are recommended to choose the option which will give residents a  litre non-recyclable waste bin to be emptied every three weeks. Paper card and metals, cartons and plastics recycling bins would also be incorporated into the -weekly collection cycle, together with a weekly food waste collection. Although a dferent option was more popular in the consultation, professional advice is that the alternative is most likely to encourage residents to recycle more and send less waste to landfill.By increasing recycling the proposed change is expected to reduce service costs by at least £, per year, money which will be reinvested into other essential council services.It is also proposed to double the number of seasonal garden waste collection points, with new facilities in locations including Balmedie, Kemnay, Kintore, Mintlaw, Newmachar and Oldmeldrum.Aberdeenshirersquos current recycling rate is only .%, but the services currently available to residents should allow over % of waste to be recycled.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Wednesday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

And we really hope that radio as a medium flourishes in Caithness with future listeners accessing and interacting with the programmes they deserve.\"Soyouve never heard the show before then you have only one last chance to do so.Just before nine oclock tomorrow night the words \"so its goodnight from me, and its good night from me.

The following autumn links were formed with Moray Firth Radio and a restricted service licence was applied for to enable a temporary broadcast in the area.In October , the first broadcast took place.

Work is due to start this year, be completed by spring  and create  jobs during the construction phase.Councillor Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness on Highland Council, said: \"While Im keen to see an improvement to the north brae, I still believe we cant take our focus off the south brae.

Improvements to the north brae are very welcome and I hope that it is the start of a bigger vision to improve the entire Berriedale Braes.\"We can expect the standard lead-in period of about three months and for discussions to be held with the contractor on how they propose to physically approach the works and discussions with statutory bodies like the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds among others.\"He said that archaeological investigatory works have been completed.The award of the contract was also welcomed by Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce.She said: \"We are delighted to see that after many years of dedicated campaigning by the chamber, Caithness Transport Forum and other local organisations, this project is finally moving ahead. For too long, the Berriedale Braes has acted as a pinch point for travellers on the A north of Inverness, disrupting business and jeopardising investment in the region.\"It has been good to see other work on A improvements and repairs going to local companies in recent years, and we hope the principal contractor will engage closely with our highly skilled local supply chain as these works progress.\"Ms Morris added: \"Now that the contract has been formally awarded, we hope to see clarication on exact start dates and expectedof works very soon.

The names of the companies involved have however, not been released.Minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: “Issuing the Invitation to Tender marks the next stage of the process to award the new contract to operate the Northern Isles Ferry Services.“The contract will run for eight years, allowing us to build a strong working relationship with the successful bidder, and all the routes within the network are being tendered as a single bundle.“The Scottish Government remains fully committed to high quality ferry services to the Northern Isles. A key benefit of this new contract is the in-built flexibility, allowing the ferry services to be amended to reflect future changes in demand across the important sectors of the islands’ economies – tourism, fishing, food and drink, aquaculture and farming. Scottish Ministers will also retain control of all of important issues, such as fares and timetables, through the public service contract.“We are committed to a fair, open and transparent tender which aims to get the best possible deal for the communities that depend on these ferry services.”• Commenting on the issue, Northern Isles MSP’s Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott said: “The Scottish Government have finally issued the tender. The timescale is very tight indeed given the operator needs to be up and running the North Isles leline ferry services in  months’ time. It is essential that companies make constructive bids with improvements to the existing service. It must, in particular, recognise the growing freight volumes that are being exported south to the Scottish mainland.“So the tender bids must be properly assessed to ensure the service moves forward and not backwards. And the endless saga of RET must come to an end, otherwise how can bidding companies submit a proposed fare policy ”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

OIC Leader James Stockan has notied Ministers that the council will hand over responsibility for running the service to Transport Scotland, unless sufficient funding is provided.A year ago, a similar level of support was secured, after a y campaign by OIC for fair funding. Of this, £. million was allocated to fully fund Orkney’s internal ferry service during the current financial year, with £ million awarded to Shetland Islands Council for its ferry operations.“But this time there is no specic amount allocated to Orkney or Shetland. The government recognises that it will cost £. million to operate our ageing fleet of ferries during - — and that is what we are asking the government to provide.”OIC is also looking to the government to fund the replacement of the current inter-island fleet. The council has been working with the government on this for a number of years and is currently developing a business case setting out the service levels local communities require, and the engineering options needed to achieve these.Councillor Stockan added: “We would object in the strongest possible termswe end up with a reduction in our ferries funding. This would place a wholly disproportionate and unfair burden on the smallest council in Scotland and would mean us having to make cuts to other vital services.“The ferries are a leline for remote and fragile communities across our islands. Orkney has the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — an inequality we cannot address without proper financial support from the Scottish Government.We are calling on the government to take an honourable approach to fulfilling the will of the Scottish Parliament that we should receive fair and equitable funding for our inter-island ferry service. The principle of transferring Orkney’s internal ferry service to the Scottish Government, at no net detriment to OIC, has already been approved by the council. That is a route we will have to take unless we are provided with the funds to run the service over the year ahead.”For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She agreed to look at ways the Scottish Government may be able to help in identying potential options.Commenting after these exchanges, Mr McArthur said: “It remains a concern that Orkney continues to be without a local abattoir. I am very conscious that the longer this remains the case, the more dficult it will be to find a solution.“I welcome the cabinet secretary’s willingness to re-engage with the Council and other local stakeholders in Orkney in an attempt to make sure that all possible options are fully explored.

Director Robbie Fraser had no knowledge of Mr MacInnes’s illness when he started to make the documentary until the mountaineer spoke on camera for the first time.Mr Fraser said: “He went on in that interview to describe being sectioned, a bewildering and deeply traumatising experience for a man who had spent so much of his le in pursuit of the sense of freedom given by climbing.“He described over the course of that interview – and his hospital notes bore out – how he managed to make his way to the roof of the hospital, pursued by staff who presumably thought he was suicidal. But, in fact, he was simply trying toto his happy place – the highest point available. “When he came out of care, all memory of his previous le had gone. What he did next seems extraordinary. As well as undergoing physical and psychological rehabilitation with the help of his friends, he seems to have rebooted his mind.”Speaking in the film, Mr MacInnes said: “I find it very dficult to remember, because I was so ill. It’s all very hazy, like looking through a very dense filter. I was found unconscious at the back door. I think I was pretty close to dying. “Somehow or other I had contracted this urinary disease. It was a terrible thing. I went down from  to eight-and-a-half stone.“I was taken in a vehicle. I knew from certain landmarks they were taking me in a circle. After that I found it quite distressing as I was sectioned and sent into confinement. It’s the only way I can put it. “I had this obsession or desire to get out because I’d been used to the open air all my le. To be cloistered there was quite a restricting mental and physical experience. I lost my memory completely, not just for a few hours, but for two or three months. “Memory is obviously very complex. One of the ways I clawed my way back to sanity was to watch all my own films. It’s quite an interesting thing. You feel asyou are a spectator looking in. This was how I refreshed. Every morning when I woke up a bit of the puzzle would come out.”In the film, Palin recalls the shock of visiting Mr MacInnes in hospital after embarking on several expeditions with him. He said: “There was just something about Hamish’s presence. He had this aura about him that made you feel you were going to be okay and that he would get you downanyone could.“I heard that he was ill and then I heard that he had been taken to a mental hospital against his will. No-one could find out why he was taken there.“I found this much reduced figure sleeping in one small room. I noticed the bed was very narrow.

What an extraordinary situation we find ourselves in as we hurtle towards the March  deadline.This week, the Prime Minister put forward her ‘plan B’ after her withdrawal deal was comprehensively rejected last week. You may have noticed that ‘plan B’ looked remarkably similar to ‘plan A’. In fact, it was nearly identical. The only dference was the letter describing it.If the Scottish independence referendum taught us anything, it’s that politicians who fail to produce genuine plan Bs are found out by the public – as Alex Salmond discovered when he failed to outline an alternative to using the British pound in .Theresa May is treating parliament and the public like fools. That’s why she is almost certain – once again – to lose the next vote on her withdrawal deal this coming Tuesday.It’s worth reminding ourselves why there is such opposition to Downing Street’s proposal.First of all, this isn’t even about our future relationship with the EU post-Brexit. This is merely the orce agreement – the terms in which we would leave the EU.It doesn’t cover what happens after we leave and that is why there is a ‘backstop’ to the issues with the border on the island of Ireland. That explains why Number Ten appeared to be floating the dangerous idea of reopening the Good Friday Agreement, before realising that was a complete non-starter. It is an international treaty underpinned by the United Nations and ratied by referenda in the north and south of Ireland.Nobody voted for a Brexit that would see Britain giving away control and leaving people poorer. It means paying a near £ billion orce bill but getting nothing in . It is the worst of all worlds, which is why it has united both Remainers and Leavers in Parliament.: First Minister warns Theresa May must drop hardline Brexit stanceThe Prime Minister has insisted she will continue making tweaks to win over MPs, but the EU has made it clear that the withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated. It is a legal text.That is not the EU being intransigent – the Prime Minister’s red lines make this the only option for the other  member states. To get any movement, she would have to loosen those red lines.Her red lines include leaving the customs union and the single market, ensuring that freedom of movement can end. That’s the freedom of movement which has allowed Brits to travel freely and live and work in European countries, and allowed the British economy to grow by addressing worker shortages in key industries.So we’re in an almighty mess. As things stand, the default scenario the country faces is a ‘no deal’ Brexit. I fear the full impact of this catastrophic option is still misunderstood.It means leaving the EU with no withdrawal agreement in place, falling back on World Trade Organizationtrade rules. That comes with tarfs on imports and quotas, for example cars would be taxed at  per cent every time they crossed the UK-EU border, and dairy products would be hit with a  per cent tarf – hence the stockpiling of key goods. As the EU confirmed only yesterday, it would also mean a hard border with Ireland.: Poll: Two-thirds of Scots believe Brexit makes independence more likelyA ‘no deal’ Brexit would wipe tens of billions of pounds off the UK economy, including around £bn in Scotland, according to the CBI. A hit of that magnitude would have a devastating impact on jobs and living standards, plunging public services into crisis. And who would be the worst affected  The poorest people in society. So that’s why those of us who care about our constituents talk about taking no-deal “off the table”. The fear is that the Prime Minister runs the clock down until March, and we automatically fall off that no-deal clf-edge because time has run out or she bribes MPs to back her botched plan.There are ways to prevent that happening, however.The Article  timetable can be altered – either extended with the agreement of the EU or unilaterally revoked. That has to happen now regardless of the way forward.If the Prime Minister allows us to leave the EU without a deal, her Government will be deliberately choosing to inflict untold damage on its people. That would be unforgiveable.Fortunately, while the Government flounders, many MPs are rising to the occasion. A series of amendments have been submitted, including a Labour frontbench amendment which legislates for the holding of a People’s Vote. Others seek to extend the Article  process.There is, of course, little point in extending Article  in an attempt to tweak the withdrawal agreement, because the negotiations are over.It should, however, be extended so that we can go back to the people of the United Kingdom and offer them a vote to decide our future.I am open-minded about what should appear on the ballot paper, but the most obvious solution is to give voters a choice between the clear measurable propositions of Theresa May’s Brexit deal – which would confirm that the people of the UK still want to leave the EU – and keeping the best deal we already have by remaining a member state of the EU.The Prime Minister claims that a People’s Vote would be damaging to democracy, yet it’s the devastation her deal will inflict on the country that will irreparably damage our democracy – and a ‘no deal’ more so.It’s time to let democracy flourish and put control back in the hands of the British people. Next Tuesday gives parliament an opportunity to do that andthe Labour Party supports a People’s Vote amendment and whips to support it, we can achieve this goal.When that time comes, I know I will put our national interest first and campaign tirelessly for the UK to remain in the EU.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4861273.1548262308!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit sees scots tories mask slip over devolution joan mcalpine msp","story":"After Scottish Conservative MPs warn the UK Government not to give the Scottish Government a formal role in post-Brexit trade negotiations, SNP MSP Joan McAlpine says it shows they are putting #extreme unionist ideology# ahead of their constituents.The Scottish Tories were against the establishment of a Scottish Parliament in the first place.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1380213.jpg--.jpg?1547207055000\n","title":"57 job losses confirmed by administrator jbe not feasible","story":"The Administrator for JBE Mechanical.Electrical Ltd, the Ballymena based electrical and mechanical firm, has announced that following a review of all options in respect of the business, that it is not feasible for the business to continue to trade.Speaking following a meeting with all staff at the firm’s headquarters at Braid River Business Park in Ballymena, the Administrator Gerard Gildernew said: “Unfortunately, following our review of live contracts and the company order book, I have concluded that it is not feasible to continue trading the business in administration.

But unfortunately it is the residents who are suffering from the impact of all of this.“Depending on the direction of the wind the smell can be so bad it makes me feel nauseous and sometimes you just want to get out of the area to get some fresh air.“You cant hang out clothes, open your windows or sit in your garden. It affects your well-being because you are always thinking how long am I going to have to live with this or will I have to sell-up, leave the home that I have put a lot of effort into and have lived in for many years  The possible health implications are also a major concern.”She continued: “It is not just me there are residents in the area who have farms or homes that have been in their families for generations.“There are other issues as well as the odour and I feel like we are the guinea pigs in all of this.“The company have told us they are working to fix the problem and we are meeting with them again on February .”One man who has lived in the area all his le but does not wish to be named, said he will have to think about movingthe situation does not improve.He stated: “The smell at times is terrible. It is a gassy smell but there is also a rotten smell to it, its hard to explain.“We cant open our windows even during the warm weather. We tried to have them open but I had to get up in the middle of the night to close them the smell was so bad.“Last summer when the weather was good everyone was out enjoying their gardens and having barbecues but we had to either sit in the house or go out to eat somewhere.”He continued: “We were told at the start that we would hear, smell or see nothing but that is not the case. “When the smell gets into the house it takes a long time for it to go. I have even had people saying they can smell it when they are driving along the Craigadoo Road and they ask me how do you stick it .“My we loves to garden but she cant because of the smell. I have lived in the area all my le andthis doesnt improve we will have to consider moving.”TUV MLA, Jim Allister, called on the company to “take urgent action”.Mr Allister led a delegation of residents to a meeting with senior management at the plant on Tuesday, January .He said: For several months these residents have been afflicted with unbearable odours from the plant which processes poultry litter.“When seeking planning permission the plant owners assured everyone they were installing state of the art technology which would ensure no smells. The supposed super efficient technology has failed and now local residents are paying the price.”Mr Allister has vowed towith the residents for a further meeting.He said he would also be pressing the Northern Ireland Environment Agency “to step up its supervision and action”.“The present intolerable position cannot continue,” he concluded.Meanwhile, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs said the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, NIEA, was aware of odour complaints relating to the Anaerobic Digestion facility at Moorfields Road, Tully Quarry.A spokesperson for the Department said: “This facility is regulated by NIEA under a Pollution Prevention and Control Permit and the permit holder is Anaerobic Advantage Ltd.“NIEA agrees that odour management at the facility has not been acceptable and the facility is currently not in compliance with its permit. In response NIEA has been working with the operator in recent months resulting in the operator taking numerous steps attempting to mitigate and resolve the problems. “NIEA staff have visited a number of the residents during this time and we have also worked in close co-operation with the local council Environmental Health officer to obtain information on the odour impact from local residents.“As a result of investigations NIEA issued an Enforcement Notice on  October  requiring the operator to provide detailed proposals to fully resolve the odour problem. The operator has now provided their proposals for additional odour treatment and it is expected this work should be completed by end of January .“NIEA will continue to inspect the site on a regular basis, maintain pressure on the operator to take all necessary actions to minimise odour nuisance and liaise with local residents to keep them updated on progress.”In a statement Stream BioEnergy Ltd said: “We acknowledge and respect the concerns raised and we are continuing to work hard to resolve these as quickly as possible.”  "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8771209.1547630975!/image/image.jpg","title":"coffee morning to raise funds for samaritans","story":"On Saturday January , from am to .pm, a coffee morning will take place in Banbridge#s Old Town Hall, to raise much needed funds for the Samaritans.Ian Burns, one of the organisers of the event, said: “It is very concerning that Northern Ireland has the highest rate ofmale suicides, within the United Kingdom. This is an issue which needs addressing and one which requires a Strategy, to be put in place.Whilst I like the idea of our local Assembly producing a strategy, it is vital that this statistic is reduced, drastically.”Ian’s we Beverley lost a family member over  years ago, through suicide. Beverley commented: “our family knows only too well the pain and heartache which family and friends endure, following such a tragic loss. For many years, you ask the question why.You also wonder,only they had engaged with someone, and that person had been able to offer some glimmer of hope, which resulted in them not pursuing their course of action. “There have been a number of suicides in our town recently and since the Samaritans are a wonderful organisation, who offer a tremendous telephone helpline service, we thought that it would be worthwhile to try and raise some funds, for this great charity.”The Samaritans’s vision is that fewer people die by suicide. They believe that it is time to look beyond the statistics and into the real lives of these people, so that they and others, can find ways, to reduce any unnecessary deaths. The Samaritans know that when people are in crisis, talking can help that person.Beverley added: “ the money raised at this event, can fund just one phone call to the Samaritans and the Samaritan at the other end of the line is able to provide some hope and results in one person not proceeding with their plan to take their own le,then this event will have been very worthwhile. “I would appeal to anyone who is facing dficulties, no matter what they are, to call the Samaritans on  .

The Belfast playwright’s scripts have a reputation for their intense humour, but at the heart of this play are the stark realities of working class le, isolation, and the emotional labour of mothers. The story gives the audience a veritable look into the lives of two overworked and underpaid care workers, Francesand Loretta , who look after the housebound -year-old Davy Magee, whose sole joys in le are horse betting, reading the Daily Mirror, and the music of Frank Sinatra.What turns out to be a catastrophic Monday for the pair begins with a small personal disaster for Loretta her son has forgotten his PE gear – she has to double back home and is late for work. In her absence, Francis has already helped Davy to the bathroom. Loretta arrives at Davy’s bungalow and chats to her friend about their respective family lives – Frances lambasts the education system for failing her entrepreneurial son, who has recently found success selling knock-off DVDs, while Loretta worries about her out-of-work husband and their inability to pay for their daughter’s school trip to Alton Towers. All the while Davy hasn’t emerged from the bathroom.When their charge fails to respond to repeated knocks at the door, Francis and Loretta panic, fearing the worst. As it turns out Davy has, in fact, died. Hilarity ensues as the women come to grips with his death and are presented with a further dilemma whatthey waited a few hours before reporting his demise, allowing them to withdraw his pension from the ATM and collect his winnings from the bookies  It would surely solve their money woes.Fearing the consequences of their petty crime, Frances and Loretta scheme up more and more elaborate ways to cover their tracks. Whatthey were caught  Whatthey were blamed for his death – could they be “up there with Myra Hindley and Fred West ”Theatrical comedy often treads a fine line between being side-splittingly funny and desperately exaggerated, but Fly Me To The Moon undoubtedly falls into the former camp. Despite the unfolding madness and slapstick antics, Tumelty and McGibbon manage to retain a level of realism in their fantastic performances. These two absurd characters could easily be ordinary Belfast women.Jones has written and directed a truly magnicent piece of comedy in Fly Me To The Moon but, crucially, the humour is punctuated, at critical moments, by important social commentary. Like many pensioners, the lonely Mr Magee, whose phonebook only contains the number of his bookie, lived a le in isolation – “a le of misery” as Frances says. The protagonists struggle with the daily problems of impoverished Belfast mothers, their crimes paling in comparison to the grand-scale corruption of politicians and bankers often mentioned in pages of their charge’s Daily Mirror. Loretta’s admission that her husband “even seemed smaller” since losing his job almost presented itself as a moment of comedy on the night, drawing a few solitary laughs before its signicance sank in. The preceding paragraph should leave readers in no doubt as to the hilarity of this play – there wasn’t a person at the Grand Opera House whose cheeks weren’t sore by the end.However, audiences will also go home, having had some laughs, with something more to ponder."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"hoax device alert sees residents evacuated in sub zero temperatures","story":"A number of residents from the Springfield Road area in West Belfast have been allowed toto their homes following the discovery of a suspicious object last night.The Springfield Road and Lanark Way were closed for a time as a controlled explosion was carried out by army technical officers on the suspicious object, which was later deeclared to be an elaborate hoax.

That’s all we asked and that’s what got.“Peter Healy, Kristian Healy, Odhran Eastwood, boys like that, James McAuley, Joe Maskey – calm heads. Eoin Nagle was fantastic up front.“It’s going to take a good team to beat us. I’m so proud of the boys – that was some performance.”Naomh Éanna settled into the game quickly and a goal from the impressive Kristian Healy, following good work from Nagle and midfielder Ethan Gibson, put them into a - to - lead on eight minutes.The pace of the Naomh Éanna attack created numerous goal chances in the first half, with Liam Kelly making a last-ditch clearance to deny Odhran Eastwood, but the Ulster side didn’t have long to wait before finding the net again.On  minutes, Joe Maskey and Kristian Healy put centre-forward Ruairi Scott through on goal and, despite Manus Breathnach’s best efforts in the An Spidéal goal, the shot had too much power and trickled into the net.The Galway men were reliant on free-taker Antaine Ó Lao to keep them in touch, with the centre-forward landing four frees in the first half.Yet their defence was being repeatedly unlocked by the sheer pace of Naomh Éanna, who forced several turnovers.With  minutes played, goalkeeper Breathnach was caught in possession around midfield and dropped the ball under pressure from James McAuley and Maskey with the former gathering possession.After talking a few steps forward, Maskey unleashed a shot with the outside of his right boot which carried  yards into the unguarded net.Leading by six at the break, Naomh Éanna never looked in danger of losing the game with Eastwood unerring from frees – finishing with a haul of -, with one from play. An Spidéal’s discipline undermined any slim hopes they had of getting back in the contest, with Eoin Ó Droigheáin and Conal Ó Caoimh picking up black cards either side of Ó Lao’s dismissal as Naomh Éanna held their nerve to claim a seven-point victory.

the public understand that the implications… people might find themselves in a situation of being forced to assume an identy they wouldn’t choose.”Ms Logan said the offer of continued EU citizenship should be extended to all the “people of Northern Ireland” as defined by the Good Friday Agreement, given recognition of the birthright of people in Northern Ireland to identy as Irish or British, or both.“The last situation we wish to see is one where the people of Northern Ireland feel forced to choose their identity based on what they think their post-Brexit entitlements might be,” she said.Ms Logan appeared before the Justice and Equality Committee on Wednesday alongside representatives from the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commissionand Queen’s University to discuss the potential implications of Brexit on human rights and equality.Thank You to the Oireachtas committee on Justice and Equality for the invitation to discuss the human rights and equality implications of #Brexit https:t.co ytRNvE— Emily LoganJanuary , Brian Gormally, director of the NIHRC Committee on the Administration of Justice said thatBrexit goes ahead, it would make the status of Irish citizens born in Northern Ireland “insecure” and they would become “EU citizens living in a non-member state”.He said the first possibility is that the Home Office would regard Irish citizens as “really” British, the second possibility is that the Common Travel Area would sort the issue out, and thirdly that EU citizens living in the UK could apply for “settled status”.“None of these options is appealing as they all involve the implication that those who choose Irish identity are in some way second-class citizens,” Mr Gormally said.“Their rights as full participants in NI le would depend on either a denial of their Irish nationality, as yet unknown bilateral agreements between the UK and Ireland about the Common Travel Area, or paying to ask the Home Office to graciously allow them leave to live in the land of their birth.“The reality is that Irish citizens, born and living in Northern Ireland, have no legal connection to the jurisdiction in which they were born.”Mr Gormally told the committee the Belfast Agreement had not been effectively implemented in UK law.He said legislation was needed in the UK and Ireland to recognise the “particular status of Irish citizens born in Northern Ireland” and their “unequivocal” right to participate fully in that region and in Irish society.Committee member Clare Daly, an Independents  Change TD, described the comments as “shocking and sobering”, adding that they had highlighted “scarily” a legal deficit regarding citizenship rights which needs to be addressed.Ms Logan and her Northern Ireland counterpart Les Allamby, chief commissioner of the NIHRC, warned the committee that the withdrawal of the UK from the EU threatened to undermine the human rights of the Good Friday Agreement.Ms Logan said that since , there had been substantial progress towards a lasting resolution of the conflict in Northern Ireland, but it assumed that the UK and Ireland would continue to be members of the EU.“Although the Joint Report of December  committed to protecting the Agreement ‘in all its parts’, Brexit negotiations currently depart from that common framework creating risks for both rights and remedies,” she said.Mr Gormally said Brexit had already “damaged” and “destabilised” the peace settlement and relations across the island.“Questions of identity and citizenship have been opened up in a way not seen since well before the Agreement – those genies cannot be put back in the bottle,” he said.“We therefore need a set of measures, across the island and, where possible, on the basis of formal treaties between the two sovereign states involved.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nodeal brexit can only be stopped by mps backing another solution says barnier","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

He said the US ignored Moscow’s offer to inspect the missile made during talks in Geneva earlier this month – a refusal he alleged reflected the lack of US interest in meaningful negotiations.Mr Ryabkov said the US has made it clear during diplomatic contacts that President Donald Trump’s decision to abandon the pact is final and not subject to talks.US undersecretary of state Andrea Thompson, who led the American side in the talks, has said Moscow’s offer is inadequate.“To see the missile does not confirm the distance that missile can travel, and at the end of the day that’s the violation of the treaty,” she told reporters last week."},{"url":null,"title":"derry hijackings mccallion convenes talks restore services","story":"Foyle MP Elisha McCallion is calling an urgent meeting with statutory agencies aimed at restoring services which have been suspended following the spate of alerts in the city.A number of services including transport, postal and housing maintenance have been suspended due to the threats and the Sinn Féin MP said it is vital that they are quickly restored.It followed the hijacking of three vans in the city yesterday - two in the Creggan area - and the attempted hijacking of a Translink bus in the Galliagh area.Ms McCallion said: “I have asked the Unity of Purpose group to urgently convene a meeting with the key statutory agencies that have had services affected as a result of this mindless spate of alerts.“It’s important that we do that in order to demonstrate that the political and civil leadership of this city is absolutely united in its opposition to what we have witnessed over the past number of days.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“We also want to show our support to the local communities who are suffering as a result.

We could all learn so much from him.Cllr Walker said he hoped those who targeted Ryanrsquos cookie box would realise the error of their ways and stop again outside the young manrsquos home to pay for the food they took.ldquoWhat happened in the dead of night outside Ryanrsquos home is a sad reflection on those responsible. If they do not pay for the goods. I hope they can be identied so the authorities can have a word, he continued.Cllr Walker, who, along with his Rowallane counterpart Terry Andrews, organises several charity events each year, hopes that his  itinerary will allow him to raise some for Ryan which he can donate to a charity of his choice.He added: ldquoRyan is a shining example to us all. He works hard to help others and it is deeply upsetting that there are those in the community who would target of all things an honesty box.

England is to introduce an opt-out system in .Mrs Taggart said: ldquoWe need to talk about the people who have lost their battle for an organ.

Still, he did everything he could to aid his recovery.Tommy and his family were so thankful to the medical team at the Freeman Hospital for saving his le in  that they raised over pound, in order ldquoto pay back the care they had received.Mrs Taggart says that her family know that the doctors ldquodid absolutely everything in their power to keep Tommy alive and had promised that he would have had his heart transplant before Christmas.ldquoThere is a typical wait of between - days for a heart and we just donrsquot know why one didnrsquot become available. But it didnrsquot and his lungs and kidneys began to fail as a consequence of his heart failure, said Mrs Taggart.Despite the efforts of the ldquophenomenal medical team, Tommy required dialysis and ventilation to keep him alive.The medical team were unable to get him breathing on his own again and he was taken off the transplant list.ldquoWe had seen Tommy go through some much and come out of the other side that it never crossed our minds that he wouldnrsquot get a heart, said Mrs Taggart.She and her family now know from personal experience just how hard it is to make a decision to donate a loved onersquos organs.ldquoDue to Tommyrsquos condition, he was only eligible to donate his corneas, she explained.ldquoWhen we were approached about this, my fatherrsquos immediate reaction was, lsquoNo, hersquos been cut into enoughrsquo, despite the fact that Tommy campaigned so passionately about organ donation, and we all knew his wishes.ldquoThankfully myself and my sister were able to be Tommyrsquos voice, and he was able to give one final and very precious gt to someone.ldquoWe desperately hope that the subject of organ donation can be normalised, and that a change in legislation and attitude is seen very soon. We are just so sorry that this change will come too late for Tommy.Mrs Taggart paid a loving tribute to her only brother: ldquoTommy was a fiercely independent, successful and outgoing young man. He was extremely intelligent, loved technology and was a fountain of knowledge.ldquoNo matter where he travelled, he made friends instantly.Mr McManus is survived by his father, sisters, brothers-in-law Bryon and Kieran, nephews Daniel, Paul and Matthew, nieces Emma and Erin, great-nephews Jay and Donal and great-nieces Chloe and Freya.bull To join the NHS organ donation register, go to www.organdonation.nhs.uk.register-your-details.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Finnebrogue to create 90 new jobs with new food ranges  ","story":"THE success of innovative Downpatrick firm Finnebrogue Artisan is set to continue with the opening of a new ultra-modern poundm vegan and vegetarian factory.The latest signicant investment by the award winning company mdash which is one of the districtrsquos leading employers mdash will support  new jobs with the new facility capable of turning over poundm a year.The latest investment by the company is in response to increasing demand for vegetarian and vegan alternatives, with the ersication illustrating the firmrsquos willingness to respond to changing trends across the food industry.The artisan food producer, which has revolutionised the bacon and ham market in the past  months by launching the first mass-produced nitrite-free alternatives, has invested poundm as it looks to step up its meat-free offerings.Finnebrogue has been producing vegetarian and vegan products for three years, but the opening of a brand new factory marks a signicant up-scaling of the firmrsquos meat-free production.The companyrsquos managing director, Brian McMonagle, said Finnebrogue prided itself on providing consumers with ldquodelicious, innovative products.ldquoGiven the increasing demand for vegan and vegetarian alternatives, this new factory was the obvious next step in our extraordinary growth, he continued.ldquoWe are determined not to stand still and are always looking to make food the best it can possibly be, without being bound by the way itrsquos always been done.

He is very focused on where he comes from. He’s very keen to do the right thing in helping to build positive relations through sport. He doesn’t seek any kudos for it.”He added: “After the formalities of the presentations Jacob is probably spending another hour with the kids, signing autographs and taking selfies.“I don’t consider myself old but I’m more than twice Jacob’s age. When you are in your late forties speaking to an assembly of school kids they look at you thinking you’re old. “Jacob is . They’re looking at him thinking he’s not much older than us. He speaks the same language as them, they can relate to him.“It’s nice to have an accessible sporting star.”Although Jacob was born in Newtownstewart, he moved to Lurgan as a schoolboy, going to school at Wallace HS in Lisburn. Up until very recently he lived with his mother and father in Lurgan, but has now moved to Belfast.Gavin said: “Lurgan is a very polarised town. The overriding aim of the project is to reach the hand across the community. Although Lurgan is the lead club we’re engaging with local Gaelic clubs – Eire Og and St Peter’s.“We have a sport like rugby which is played on an All Ireland basis and we have an inidual who could make it into a world XV team on our doorstep and who is willing to turn up at school events.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before her move to London she had worked for Paul Rankin at Roscoff’s.Mary-Anne said she had always intended to come home from London and her original intention was to open a café deli. She said the market stall was designed to be a stopgap while she looked for premises but she ended up spending ten years there until she had her twins three years ago.“I was self-employed so I couldn’t take maternity leave from the market for more than eight weeks or I would lose the pitch,” she said.“I was already doing some midweek cookery classes at home in Moy, so I decided to expand on that and convert the garage into a state of the art facility. I really enjoy it and it allows me to work from home.”Courses cost from £ and include tea coffee and scones. Mary-Anne delivers savoury cookery classes as well but explained that baking is far and away the most popular.“I wasn’t actually trained as a pastry chef but there has been such a resurgence in the popularity of baking. That is where the demand is. I would love to do more cookery classes where people can learn to do savoury foods too, however the majority of bookings are for those sweet treats we all love. I like to combine traditional recipes and new flavours. Local, seasonal and organic ingredients are key.”Each course can accommodate - people and are booked out weeks in advance. All recipes andequipment are provided and you get to take home what you make.“My style is informal, it’s all about having fun. I do hands-on and demonstration classes and cater for all levels from complete beginners to more experienced cooks. The aim is to get stuck in.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/steve_web.jpg","title":"the catalyst to putting northern ireland on the global map","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Ulster Business speaks to Catalyst Inc chief executive Steve Orr about his hugely ambitious plans for growth, expansion and moulding NI into a world-leader in tech ‘We aren’t going to follow anyone , and we need toto becoming leaders in the world.’It’s immediately clear that Steve Orr has big ambitions for Catalyst Inc.

It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed.

The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come.

It’s still lovingly referred to as the Swiss watch stalwart’s sister brand.From there, following the Second World War, he decided now was the time to expand and give the brand an identity of its own.The primary dference between the brands back then, was that Rolex watches carried in-house movements, and that Tudor would offer familiar watch styles, such as the Oyster and Submariner, at a more affordable cost, while its big brother would guarantee the technical, aesthetic and al characteristics, along with distribution and after sales service.But the brand back then, and the company now, has changed radically. Just a few years ago, it tore up the rulebook on its traditional line – moving away from historically similar watches to Rolex, and a few changes from its classical lines, towards a tight range of watches, bringing in the old and the new.The core model is the Black Bay. A millimetre larger than the Rolex Submariner, it’s a slightly chunkier affair, without treading into the excessive sizes of some other brand’s modern timepieces. It also offers a new ‘’ –  a smaller mm watch, which fits right in as a cheaper alternative to the Submariner, a Black Bay Chronograph and the Pelagos – a larger, more modern affair made out of titanium.The brand also comes in at a time when Rolex prices have shot up, considerably. Many of the most desirable models in the Rolex line have a waiting list – with second-hand prices outpacing the new book price.Tudor itself has also embraced this burgeoning demand, releasing its own GMT watch – with so-called ‘Pepsi’ blue and red bezel. Currently, Rolex’s own model – aside from the sizeable price dference – will mean joining a waiting list. A WEEK ON THE WRIST Tudor Heritage Black Bay Sitting as Tudor’s poster-boy or flagship in its range, the Black Bay is a e watch which melds the styling and inspiration of, possibly the most recognisable watch in the world, the Rolex Submariner, with a larger case, while adding patina on the hands and markers.There’s no crown-guard, ala Rolex. This time, it’s a larger, screw-down, with an etched Tudor rose – formerly the brand’s logo.Overall, the Black Bay’s case is brushed, including the caseback, with the finish smoothly transitioning into a polish around the sides and crown.The sapphire crystal glass is slightly domed, sitting around a millimetre off the face off the watch. Around the edge, the bezel is a solid, thick and satisfyingly sold -click version, with red triangle and lume dot.This version is on a steel bracelet, but is also available on a leather or fabric band, along with red dial and blue – the latter without the patina on the markers and hands.The bracelet is a stand-out characteristic of the piece, certainly in terms of build quality. The three-piece links have a lug width of mm, tapering to around mm. It’s brushed, but polished and riveted along the side. On the clasp, there’s a double-locking system, with a thoughtful inclusion of the Tudor shield logo into the mechanism, along with three points of micro-adjustment.This watch, available from jeweller Lunn’s, spent several days on my wrist – from the office, to out-and-about and around the house. It’s a comfortable piece to wear – balanced between a bit more heft than its more expensive sibling, but never straying into the realm of gaudy or garish.After a few hours, it felt very much like one of my own. I did miss the date, however, but those after additional complications or ality could look to the chronograph version, or the larger Pelagos.The Black Bay is a well-balanced piece – easily sitting at the centre of a Venn diagram between casual and formal.The brand itself is firing everything at the new range, with endorsements from David Beckham and Lady Gaga, aimed at a younger generation with disposable income to spare. While that may not appeal or speak to the horological purists, with the in-house movement, attention to detail, provenance and mixture of the traditional and modern, it’s likely to build a fresh reputation as a ‘watch fan’ timepiece, and for those who have no issue explaining to those admiring the chunk of steel on their wrists, that it isn’t a Rolex.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
