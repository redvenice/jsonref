He was quite upset by it… and I was speaking in his defence.\u0027One of the two Zionists was identified by MailOnline as Mr Millett, who often attends events he suspects of spreading anti-Semitism and writes about them on his blog afterwards.‘I didn\u0027t berate anybody and I\u0027m not an aggressive person,\u0027 he told MailOnline. \u0027I\u0027ve had this over the years, everyone\u0027s been trying to smear me as aggressive, and it\u0027s just not true.\u0027That\u0027s the smear, and now it\u0027s coming from the very top. Jeremy Corbyn is making it more widespread. He\u0027s trying to make me persona non grata.\u0027Although Mr Millett accepts that he may have had a conversation with the Palestinian representative, he called the idea that he was aggressive \u0027ridiculous\u0027.\u0027He\u0027s the last person I\u0027d have a go at,\u0027 he said. \u0027We don\u0027t agree on Israel but I\u0027ve always got on with him personally.‘He\u0027s a very personable chap. He always answers my questions and we never get into arguments.\u0027The Labour leader knew Mr Millett personally at the time, the blogger said, as they \u0027mixed in the same circles\u0027 and were both involved with the same television station.This, he said, made his comments about him not understanding \u0027English irony\u0027 all the more hurtful.\u0027Corbyn knew me to say hello to me,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s not like I was a stranger. He read my blog. He knew that I was British and Jewish. He was targeting me.\u0027  \u0027As the Labour Party faces the scrutiny of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, at long last Mr Corbyn himself must now face a British court so that a judge can separate fact from fiction.\u0027 Mr Corbyn has since said his use of the word Zionist was \u0027in the accurate political sense and not a euphemism for Jewish People\u0027. He has also committed to being \u0027more careful\u0027 with his language in future.Mr Millett, whose father founded the Millets chain of outdoor clothing stores, said Jewish people are \u0027scared on a physical level\u0027 amid Labour\u0027s ongoing anti-Semitism crisis.Gideon Falter, Chief Executive of the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism (CAA), said: \u0027When Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s comments about “Zionists” being un-English came to light, they sent shockwaves through the Jewish community.\u0027Over the last four years, as the evidence of Mr Corbyn\u0027s antisemitism has mounted, instead of apologising, he has dug deeper, responding to each allegation against him by splitting hairs and spinning tales that beggar belief.\u0027As the Labour Party faces the scrutiny of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, at long last Mr Corbyn himself must now face a British court so that a judge can separate fact from fiction.\u0027Fiona Sharpe, spokesman for Labour Against Antisemitism, added:‘Labour Against Antisemitism fully supports the legal action being taken by Jewish activist Richard Millett against the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.‘Mr Corbyn’s comments that “British Zionists… don’t understand English irony”, made at a Palestine Return Centre event in 2013, and his subsequent comments regarding Mr Millett made on the Andrew Marr Show in September 2018, were in our opinion offensive, defamatory and arguably antisemitic.‘Racial discrimination on the Left needs to be confronted and tackled effectively and aggressively - even if to do so requires recourse to the law courts.’  "},{"url":null,"title":"Toy shop worker creates low tech version Lion Kings Circle Life using model animals","story":"Share this article With the barcode labels still attached, he fixes rods on to the toys to move them around the basic set. The climax of the video is inevitably the lifting up of the baby Simba - the future king.           Rafiki, who in the movie is a mandrill species of monkey native to west Africa, is instead portrayed by a toy orangutan - an animal which actually inhabits south east Asia         With the barcode labels still attached, he fixes rods on to the toys to move them around the basic set       Alongside the standard animals found wandering the planes of Africa, Kyle also decided to feature some toy geese and chickens in his mock-up.In the Disney movie, the lion is shown to the animal kingdom from a rock which juts out from the mountainside, but Kyle makes do with a model of a craggy cliff edge instead.And Rafiki, who is a mandrill species of monkey native to west Africa, is portrayed by a toy orangutan - an animal which actually inhabits south east Asia. In the film, once the newborn cub is raised aloft, the gathered animals bow their heads in respect.But obviously it is impossible to bend the rigid plastic heads of the toys, so Kyle flicks them over on to their sides.           The Lion King\u0027s Circle of Life scene is one of the most iconic movie moments in the Disney franchise         Kyle Fisher, social media manager for Tom\u0027s Toy\u0027s, gathered up toy monkeys, elephants, giraffes and of course lions to recreate the opening scene of the 1994 animation."},{"url":null,"title":"The father Elin Nordegrens baby NFL tight end Jordan Cameron","story":"Share this article After his split from Elin in 2010, Tiger went on to date Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn, who he was in a relationship with for three years, from 2012 until 2015. At the time, Lindsey insisted that their break-up was mutual, and the result of conflicting work schedules, however DailyMail.com exclusively revealed in May 2015 that Tiger had cheated on the sporting superstar after he was eliminated from a golf tournament. \u0027He had a relapse in the sex department,\u0027 a close friend revealed. \u0027Lindsey found out about women again.

With few exceptions the celebrities brightening our screens favour only the most familiar ingredients: ‘prime’ cuts of meat such as rack of lamb, duck breasts, sirloin steak and so on.Seafood consists invariably of salmon, tiger prawns and cod. How much more useful it would be to show viewers the economic, practical and healthy benefits of cheap cuts, offal and less familiar fish!However, with channels chasing ratings, terrified that the audience will switch off at the sight of a firm, perfectly cooked kidney or a deliciously spiced haggis, it is never going to happen. Cooking shows are entertainment, and no substitute for learning to cook from a parent.         Faggots are another genius ‘nose-to-tail’ solution. They are made from pork liver, heart and belly, wrapped in a lacy ‘caul’ of fat (pictured: Faggots with potato mash, peas and gravy)What’s more, we shop differently today from the way we did in the past. Not so long ago, High Street shopkeepers were essential in educating their customers. Traditional butchers chatted to the lady who had popped in for lamb chops but went out, after a bit of advice, with some cheaper and much more delicious lamb neck instead. This was an essential service — and it was free.New mothers, the elderly, a single person moving into their first home — all could learn from their friendly butcher, fishmonger or greengrocer.Instead, nowadays, we trudge silently with our trolley around the supermarket aisles.Largely as a result of the supermarkets’ influence, our high streets lack the variety they used to display. And hard-working supermarket staff don’t have the time to offer cooking advice.         New mothers, the elderly, a single person moving into their first home — all could learn from their friendly butcher, fishmonger or greengrocer (pictured: Jellied eels)Supermarkets are the culprit in another way. Their model is built on centralised supply: every branch, from Cumbria to Cornwall, sells the same food, often from the same warehouse. Typically, they have little or no local buying policy and put great emphasis on imported produce and novelty. By doing so they have done much to destroy Britain’s richly historical regional food culture.Many of the items on the bottom tier of the survey were specialities of particular areas. Jellied eels became one of the best-loved dishes of London’s East End because the Thames was full of them.Passion for cheap, nourishing jellied eels is embedded in the Cockney mindset, though it is disappearing fast.Haggis is a fine example of how canny cooks invented ways to use all of an animal, in this case the sheep. Chopped, seasoned and sealed inside the animal’s stomach as a homemade sausage — perfect for boiling! — it symbolises 500 years of croft farming and is justly beloved of the Scots.Faggots are another genius ‘nose-to-tail’ solution. They are made from pork liver, heart and belly, wrapped in a lacy ‘caul’ of fat, and were once a favourite supper wherever you found pigs: the South-West, the Midlands and Yorkshire.         Liver was sliced thinly, then flash-fried in butter. Tender and a little pink in the middle, it was beautifully complemented by crisp bacon and smooth, buttery mashed potato (pictured: Liver and onions)Enthusiasm for faggots — the name doesn’t help — has been dwindling for decades in spite of the meat industry’s best efforts. In the Seventies, a campaign ran with a slogan that would probably not be used today: ‘Surprise your husband with a faggot.’It might be idealistic to suggest that everyone can be persuaded to try food made with blood, guts and heaven knows what else.While travelling, I have wimped out of challenging delicacies. In the Faroe Islands, I was proudly served fermented mutton, a die-hard speciality if ever there was one. I could still taste it three days later — but the Faroese, who eat it as infants, love it.A parent who wants their child to enjoy everything can be forgiven for cheating: I fed our daughter black pudding from a very young age without telling her what it was. She loved its rich crumbliness, crisp edges and herby seasoning.When she was about 12, she asked me what it was made from. Her face fell for a moment when I told her, then swiftly recovered.Delicious won the battle — and if she one day feeds black pudding to her children, perhaps that food will start to rise again to its rightful place in the pantheon of great British dishes."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/06/13/16/4ACC9E9200000578-0-image-m-59_1560440406564.jpg","title":"Stop calling Jeremy C says Jeremy Hunt series air gaffes presenters","story":"Share this articleGrow up and stop calling me the c-word live on air, Jeremy Hunt tells broadcasters"},{"url":null,"title":"Four five Ofsted rated outstanding schools downgraded inspected year","story":"Share this article However, it proves parents should in future be suspicious of outstanding-rated schools which have not been inspected for a number of years.The reason why Ofsted does not routinely inspect outstanding-rated schools is a government-imposed exception aimed at letting them \u0027get on with their good work\u0027.

This horribly prescient exhibition shows how to respond to calamityKeith Haring was everywhere in the 1980s. All over the walls of the New York subway, all over T-shirts, all over posters, all over dresses and all over Grace Jones’s body. You could wear him on your lapel. He was there when you needed him and there when you didn’t. He was in all the galleries and nightclubs and he invaded your house. He was all over MTV and he wanted to be all over the Berlin Wall, a section of which he painted. Haring was joyous, riotous, funny and angry, this gawky skinny kid with the glasses and a Sharpie pen. And then he was gone, dead at 31 from Aids-related illness in 1990.Now he fills the top floor of Tate Liverpool and the gallery shop. His little bouncy figures climb the columns in the cafe. With his outlined boing-boing beings and miraculous babies, his barking dogs and his three-eyed faces, his boys in heat and his general malarkeys, he took potshots at God, sexual repression, America’s culture of guns and the dollar, and much besides.There was more to Haring than his ubiquitous cartoons, and this travelling exhibition (it goes to Brussels and Essen), mounted with the co-operation of the artist’s estate, unpacks his work from its early beginnings to his outspoken responses to the Aids crisis. There are videos of early student performance works and projected images of the 80s New York club scene. Andy Warhol, William Burroughs, David Hockney, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Tom Verlaine and Robert Mapplethorpe pass through, along with all the denizens of the downtown dark.And always there were the drawings, from early, art-school abstractions and filmed performances, drawings made in public on the subway (for Haring, drawing was a kind of performance art) and drawings often used as posters, protesting against apartheid, railing against religious intolerance and bigotry, homophobia and racism. He celebrated Coming Out Day and had a chirpy cartoon condom promote safe sex.Haring made a great deal out of what appears an extremely limited lexicon of forms and a basic, though singular, style. The thick, simplified line, the speed and certainty of his one-shot drawing approach, wouldn’t seem to offer much leeway. But the show is full of variety, for one thing in the way Haring kept complicating and developing his bestiary. He presented his painted drawings in a UV-lit gallery basement, against walls striped red and yellow, with blasting music. He drew stories and parables, cheeky same-sex couplings, almost medieval scenes of torture, torments, monsters, Bosch-like penis-beings, choking cockerels, angels and maggots, flying skulls and tiny humans ripped apart.His later work (in a career lasting barely a decade) teems with life and death, pluggings and unpluggings, gods and demons. What began with wry smiles, as a buoyant, seemingly benign art, ended up heaving with malevolence. Going through the show I felt like Dante being led into the circles of hell by Mickey Mouse. Walking past walls covered in club flyers, seeing footage of Haring handcuffed by a transport cop for drawing on the subway, passing through the Mudd Club and Club 57, then marching on Washington to protest government inaction on Aids. In the 80s, Haring wrote the writing on the wall: Crack is Wack, Ignorance  Fear and Silence  Death. He drew flying saucers training their beams on the city, and a prone body spewing a monstrous cloud of chaos into the sky.The modern apocalypse is no less filled with demons as any medieval vision of the end. For a gay man in the 80s, the end was all too present and personal. Through all this, Haring’s art – and it was art of a high order when seen in full – never lost its grip. Making work increasingly terrible and apocalyptic in its own visions, he somehow still manages to exhilarate us through it all. As much as Haring was an artist of his time – he seems almost to typify it – the show feels horribly prescient. Same end, different apocalypse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b37cdc1cc5214ad0e1ef707e14aa7446e204bc3/0_0_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=252fc9b7b22207bcd3cb340e79ddfe4a","title":"photographer stephen dupont looks back a picture essay","story":"The renowned Australian photographer chooses 10 of his most memorable images and explains why they had an impact. He is talking at Aperture, the southern hemisphere’s largest photography conference, held from 22 to 23 June in SydneyWhenever I travelled to Afghanistan I was always looking to tell the human stories of Afghans and how they cope with life under constant war. When I was covering the civil war between the Northern Alliance and the Taliban in late 1998, I came across this soldier along a front line near Bagram airfield, just north of the capital Kabul. When I saw his prosthetic arms I was compelled to make a rare (for me) set-up portrait. He then told me his story:I was not a soldier before I used to work for an international NGO de-mining company trying to rid the country of landmines. One day I was de-mining when one blew off my arms – a mine that had been planted by the Taliban. It was then that I decided to join up with the Northern Alliance and learned to shoot an AK-47 with my new arms so I could take revenge.For me photography has always been about having fun and there’s no better enjoyment then street photography. I have been going to Havana for many years now and it was and still is one of the best places in the world for street photography. The old-world charm of Cuba oozes through every crack and along every street corner. Also in public view are most people’s interiors. When you’re walking along the street you’re watching out for any moment outdoors but you are also drawn into the more private spaces as well. I saw this woman sitting just as she was from the street looking in. I stopped in my tracks and thought, should I? I walked to the door and through my very broken Spanish I asked if I could take her photograph. She said yes. The lighting was perfect, the setting incredible, everything was there for the taking. You don’t take photographs, you’re given them. Photography is a gift.Aside from Afghanistan, Papua New Guinea is the one country I have travelled in and photographed most. I had been inspired to go by the films by friend and colleague Bob Connolly and late-night stories from Mark Worth who sadly passed away some years ago. This photograph was taken on my first trip to PNG at an annual cultural festival in the Western Highlands capital Mount Hagen. I paid some locals to build me a makeshift grass hut studio and I invited sitters to be photographed.I was in Srinagar working on a story around war trauma. Kashmir is one of the world’s longest-running conflicts that dates back to the British partition of India and Pakistan. I wanted to look at the consequences of human suffering from the Indian side of Kashmir. I’d already been to the Pakistan side a year earlier. I covered the weekly protests, mainly young Muslim youths against Indian soldiers. Very similar to what I’d witnessed on many occasions in Israel and Palestine, a kind of David v Goliath scenario. I received a minor injury when an Indian soldier shot a stun grenade directly at me and it hit the top of my foot. I photographed them dragging off protestors into trucks. At some point I found myself inside the main psychiatric hospital. I had a really good fixer who got me in and I worked frantically knowing that my access was unique and that I would be tossed out or worse at any time. It was visually strong and many of the patients were in there because of the effects of war.For me a good war photograph must be an anti-war photograph. War is a nasty business and traumatises both the killers and the victims. While embedded with the US marines in Kunar province in 2005 I was out on a routine patrol with them as they searched for insurgents or weapons caches. I noticed that the marine in front of me stopped at the corner of a mud wall, trigger ready. As I framed my picture I could see an incredibly intense gaze from a young boy with other gazes and interesting compositions spilling the frame. For me this young boy summed up an entire nation’s feeling towards a foreign occupation. War also makes the youth fearless.Lately I have been digging through my archive looking for broken frames. These are photographs that have been unintentionally messed up, double exposed, light or emulsion leakage and x-ray damaged. This portrait I took of Tim Page is a personal favourite. Tim is a very close friend and I grew up wanting to be a photographer through his words and photographs. He was one of the inspirations for me to cover war. Tim is most famous for his coverage of the Vietnam war and I feel quite blessed not to just know the man but be invited right now to collaborate with him on a kind of retrospective book of his Nam pictures and contact sheets.In 2009 I had the fortune to be an artist in residence with the Sydney festival. A festival highlight was one of my all-time favourite bands Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds who would play Cockatoo Island. As I had an all-access pass, I found Nick Cave and Warren Ellis backstage before one of their gigs. I asked if I could take some portraits and Nick and Warren posed in a back room. After not even finishing a roll of 12 frames, Nick said “I think you got the shot” and they walked away. Happily I did get the shot, thank you Nick, you were right.I was covering the chaos and aftermath from the 1999 East Timorese referendum for independence. Pro-Indonesian militia were roaming streets killing people, soldiers were looting and burning down buildings as they prepared to depart by ships. I was among the first wave of journalists to arrive as the international community sent in foreign forces to bring stability and peace to the world’s newest nation. I flew in with the British on C130 Hercules and was met with total chaos throughout the city. Most folks had fled the city before we arrived and were still hiding in the nearby jungles. But slowly they returned as more and more foreign soldiers arrived, many from Australia. I took this photograph as a man was pushing a cart with a child inside of it and passed a former Indonesian military barracks that was on fire. I liked the caged symbolism of the child against the inferno-esque backdrop. I remember thinking it reminded me of scenes I had often seen from photographs taken in Cambodia during the genocide there.I can never forget this photograph because soon after I took the frame I was mugged. I was in Bucharest shooting a story around stray dogs (there were 300,000 in the city alone). Whenever I go to a new city I like to walk around and get a feel for the place and shoot street pictures. It was mid winter, snowing with that eastern European grey tinge to the place, when suddenly I was cornered by four men in trenchcoats. I had my Leica around my neck and my Hasselblad Xpan over my shoulder, maybe even a Rolleiflex as well. They asked for my wallet, took out all my cash and handed it back to me before moving on. All I could think about at that moment was what I was prepared to do if they went for my cameras.

Combine both at Mindil Beach Sunset Market, which buzzes with live music, crafts and food – all locally made. For the ultimate Mindil evening, Flight Centre’s Amber Farley recommends the market’s “Asian-inspired snacks and sorbets, then picnic at a film screening”. Feeling still more daring? Order a “roadkill burger”, made with kangaroo, buffalo or crocodile, before heading to the beach for a piña colada-coloured sunset.An Indigenous Australian art site with sweeping views over Arnhem Land, Ubirr is one of the most untouched and spiritually significant swathes of land in Australia. Visit the Rainbow Serpent – an Indigenous Australian creation story character believed to have painted her own image here as she snaked through the region – then climb to the site’s highest spot for a seductive sunrise and sunset views of Kakadu’s “stone country”. “The rolling plains look like they are glowing and the birdsong is hypnotic,” says Farley.Farther south, Kakadu’s dry land becomes a water-filled oasis, and Yellow Water billabong is a wildlife photographer’s dream. Lily pads float on its surface and paperbark trees rise up through its waters, as saltwater crocodiles bask on its banks and giant sea eagles and colourful kingfishers flit above it. Take a cruise with an Indigenous Australian guide in the early morning or evening to seek out the best snaps.Nitmiluk national park’s network of 13 gorges features soaring red and craggy cliffs rising above teal-toned waters. The freshwater crocodiles that lurk beneath are far less deadly than their salty cousins, making this a glorious canoeing spot. One tucked-away treasure you shouldn’t skip is the Southern Rockhole, an emerald-coloured waterfall-fed swimming hole. “Whether you are a first time traveller or a returning fan, this nature spot is one that keeps on giving,” says Flight Centre’s Farley.Wangi Falls, in Litchfield national park, robs many visitors of their breath. An arcing stretch of foliage-infused rock hosts two water streams that tumble from up to 85 metres into a glistening swimming hole. To reach the top, follow the walking trail, looping past trees loaded with flying foxes. “Take some meat, bread and utensils with you, and make use of the area’s BBQ facilities to extend your stay in this beautiful environment,” says Flight Centre’s Farley.A traditional Anangu dreaming site, this behemoth redheaded rock is taller than the Eiffel Tower and takes a cool three and a half hours to walk around. As the sun rises and falls over “The Rock”, the surfaces shift colours – from red and orange, through to maroon and purple – making Uluru a clear contender for Best Australian Backdrop, full stop.Ninety miles east of Uluru lies imposter rock “Fool-uru”. Travellers driving from Alice Springs often mistake this monolith – almost equal in size to Uluru – for the real deal. In fact, flat-topped Mount Conner is private property – so you’ll have to book a tour to visit – but those who do so will be rewarded with a lot more than a poor man’s Uluru. Conner’s striking horseshoe inselberg overlooks seven salt lakes and 1,500-head of cattle. “It’s a chance to step away from the crowds and learn about what this vast part of Australia can offer,” says Farley, who recommends rounding the visit off with a three-course home-cooked meal and a glass of fizz at the cattle station.Travellers with time for desert hopping would be mad to miss Kings Canyon, a sprawling wonderland of dome-like rocks, pink cliffs, abundant bird life and bursts of flora. The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert was filmed here, and the area was once entirely underwater, so keep your eyes peeled for stone paths imprinted with marine fossils. “The Garden of Eden”, a cycad-filled gully, is another highlight.A sacred site for the Indigenous Australian Arrernte women, this dramatic red corridor owes its existence to a tributary that once flowed through sandstone to meet the Finke River. Visit at midday for the best light – and venture beyond the chasm for views of the mountain ranges and a pretty walking path, lined with lush bushland.Picture-perfect swimming spot Ellery Creek Big Hole, 50 miles from Alice Springs, cuts through a gorge in the West MacDonnell Ranges. The scenery en route from Alice recalls the paintings of mid-century Indigenous Australian artist Albert Namatjira: expanses of ochre soil, soft green eucalyptus and skies ribbed in royal blue.With so many things to see, do and capture on camera, you might need a little help squeezing everything into your Aus adventure.

Business can have no absolute reassurance that an agreement will be reached, particularly given the commitment of some Conservative leadership candidates to leaving the EU in October, with or without a deal. It feels like the extension is at risk of being wasted.”The IoD said there had been very limited financial support from central government for small businesses to prepare, despite repeated calls from the employers’ group for Brexit planning vouchers to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) receive professional help for complex trade and legal issues.Morgan said that getting a deal would be “by some distance” the better outcome, adding that it would prolong the uncertainty if Britain had to trade with the EU on the same World Trade Organization terms as countries such as China and the US.“If businesses can’t have faith in politicians that means they have to look out for themselves. With business costs rising in many quarters, and management time precious, it’s understandable that firms don’t want to put resources towards preparing for something we still hope won’t happen. But the risk of no deal is very real and so we’d urge all businesses, if they haven’t done so already, to carefully consider their exposure and draw up mitigation plans now.”Speaking on Thursday, Tesco’s chief executive, Dave Lewis, said it was harder for supermarkets to prepare for a no-deal exit from the EU in October than it was in March because they will be storing more products for Halloween and Christmas in their warehouses, leaving limited space for Brexit stockpiles. “October will be much more challenging than March was,” Lewis said. “We’ll be coming out of Halloween and building stock for the Christmas peak, so the capacity in the supply chain will be much more challenging. It’s about sheer physical capacity. It’s not just the availability – it’ll be the space.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/639de100e94f2b15df49dce3015e48959d4303a2/0_464_7846_4708/master/7846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=407e492cb1af1299f9f274a00240d5b6","title":"has tokyo reached peak city","story":"You could argue that the world’s biggest city has hit a sweet spot: a flatlining population, pervasive transit and little gentrification. But is ‘peak city’ even possible – and where does Tokyo go from here?Tokyo is often described as crowded, mushrooming, figuratively bursting at the seams. Except, in many ways, it’s not.Unlike many megacities, the world’s largest metropolitan area has largely stopped growing, either in land or population. Where Mumbai, Lagos or São Paulo continually sprout new informal neighbourhoods that are constantly outstripping the ability of the city to catch up, Tokyo’s urban planning and services more or less seamlessly encompass the central wards and the neighbouring cities of Kawasaki, Yokohama, Chiba and Saitama that form its unbroken metropolitan area.Despite Japan’s ageing population, Tokyo’s demographics are actually quite middle of the road. Far from being crammed with people, Tokyo is in fact averagely dense – more crowded than some cities, less so than others.As Japan\u0027s capital enters a year in the spotlight, from the Rugby World up to the 2020 Olympics,  Cities is spending a week reporting live from the largest megacity on Earth. Despite being the world\u0027s riskiest place – with 37 million people vulnerable to tsunami, flooding and due a potentially catastrophic earthquake – it is also one of the most resilient, both in its hi-tech design and its pragmatic social structure. Using manga, photography, film and a group of salarimen rappers, we\u0027ll hear from the locals how they feel about their famously impenetrable city finally embracing its global crownUnemployment and crime are low. Traffic is comparatively well-managed, while the modal share of transit and cycling are high: Tokyo in particular has solved what many cities call the “last-mile” transit problem, by relying on an informal network of cheap bicycles. Gentrification, though a factor, feels less disruptive than in similarly prosperous cities such as London and New York, where entire neighbourhoods are being rewritten at great speed, or most Chinese cities, which are unrecognisable to themselves 15 years ago.Of course, Tokyo has many problems. Its real estate remains expensive, its sprawl makes for long commute times, it has less green space per capita than one might hope for, and worrying social problems remain. Nor has Tokyo stopped changing: because real estate value is tied so closely to land rather than property, new buildings rarely last longer than 30 years, leading to a constant shedding of the city’s skin.But is there an argument to be made that Tokyo, having now finished its postwar growth spurt, has reached a kind of maturity? Is this the most stable form of megacity that can exist at present – occupying an equilibrium where the population is stable, change is manageable, and the city’s residents and industries are in some sort of balance?While the cities of Kinshasa and Delhi continue to grow apace, and the Chinese government has actively restricted the growth of Shanghai and Beijing, Tokyo’s population has evened out – in part because it has more or less run out of new land to cover, and in part because of the ageing population of Japan.“Tokyo is the first megacity to see the end of growth,” says Andre Sorensen, chair of the department of human geography at the University of Toronto, whose 2002 book The Making of Urban Japan was widely praised as key to understanding Japanese urban planning. “It offers important lessons for cities around the world, as ‘peak urban’ will increasingly be seen elsewhere over the rest of this century as the world becomes fully urban and population growth slows and then starts to decline.”“The bell curve of the population age will be 50-60, and the city will contract and become more concentrated,” agrees Mark Dytham of Klein Dytham Architects. “The bulk will slowly evaporate leaving a stronger essence of the city and I think in the next 20 years in 2040 you are going to see the city stop contracting as birth rate levels out.”Although immigration is increasing, it remains a relative drop in the bucket.“Tokyo is clearly at or near its peak population, at the high point of the rollercoaster ride, the point when the distant horizon comes into view, just before the nose points down, gravity takes charge, and downward acceleration begins,” Sorensen says. “Although few demographers are willing to say so, it is hard to imagine the factors sufficient to end this decline.”One clear benefit of this “peak” is that housing prices have levelled out, more than two decades after the burst of the asset bubble in 1991. This allowed, says Sorensen, “an extraordinary burst of high-rise residential development in the core of the city over the last 15 years, in part because lower land prices made it economically viable to build new condominiums in central areas.”Unfortunately, Tokyo is also sucking up people and resources from the regions. “The construction of housing in the Tokyo core just means that many more vacant dwellings in the suburbs and the rest of Japan. And housing vacancy and abandonment is already an epidemic of vast proportions, particularly in declining regions, but already also in the Tokyo suburbs.”That’s a huge problem, agrees Tom Gill, professor of social anthropology at Meiji Gakuin University in Tokyo, who specialises in Japanese social issues, especially casual labour, poverty, homelessness and minority issues. For one thing, Gill says, it robs the regions of youth and hurts industries such as agriculture and fisheries. The government’s latest effort to increase immigration is in large part aimed at reviving those creaking industries, as  Cities reported earlier this week. “This is a gigantic socioeconomic problem, and one that successive governments have signally failed to address.” Unlike some countries where governments attempt to offset the centrality of a single dominant city by spreading services to smaller cities, in Japan most officialdom is centred in Tokyo. “There has been plenty of talk about devolution and decentralisation, but no action,” Gill says.The dominance of Tokyo hurts the regions in other ways. This week, the  reported on how the 2020 Olympics projects have sucked up construction labour and driven up the price of raw materials, hugely slowing the reconstruction of the lands that were destroyed by the 2011 tsunami.“The Tokyo Olympics have adversely impacted the ongoing struggles of local communities in the quake-tsunami-meltdown stricken north-east,” agrees Franz Prichard, assistant professor at the Department of East Asian Studies of Princeton University and author of Residual Futures, a book about Japanese cultural responses to urbanisation in the 1960s and 70s. He argues that this can “complicate the myth of recovery” from which Tokyo currently benefits. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is currently pushing the narrative that the nuclear disaster is “under control”, as Japan attempts to resume selling nuclear plants abroad.“The 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster was symbolic,” agrees Gill. “The crippled reactors were located in rural Fukushima, but the electricity they generated went straight to Tokyo. This was a particularly striking example of the regions being sacrificed for the benefit of the metropolis.”But the availability of relatively affordable housing in the centre of the city does mean that there is less concern with a huge issue transforming other developed-world capitals, such as London and New York: gentrification.And it’s not just because of newbuild construction, says the architect and urban theorist Hiroshi Ota. Because Japanese real estate values land over property, it is often the case that the smallest houses are in fact the most valuable.From a rooftop in Aoyama, he points out the low clusters of single-family homes.“Those are probably richer people than the people living in the tower blocks,” he says. “And they won’t leave. They don’t sell.“It’s also hard for commercial property developers to buy them out and knock them down, because the lots are so small, and neighbours often refuse to sell in groups. And for many unused plots of land, nobody knows who the owner is at all – it’s some distant family relation who might not even know they’re the owner, or they’re all dead.” Major developments like Roppongi Hills required large parcels of land that were already in one set of hands, and that’s a rarity.Nevertheless, there has been gentrification in the sense that young families have been pushed out from the core by lack of services. Tom Gill notes that a short walk from Shibuya or Shinjuku, you will see little parks with no children playing on the swings and slides. “In fact, right in the centre of Tokyo, many of the primary schools closed down many years ago, as rising housing prices forced people out of the city centre, where residential districts were taken over by high-rise office buildings.”The suburbs have taken on a lot of the social problems the city centre no longer has to deal with. “As your own paper pointed out just yesterday, suburban housing projects have become ghettoes for the old,” he says. “Not much violence in the streets — but how about the solitary old people dying alone (kodokushi) in their apartments, their bodies often not discovered until they start decomposing and smelling? Is that what happens in a peak city?”The city’s transit system is the envy of the world: dozens of private metro and public rail lines run impeccable service across nearly the entirety of the metropolitan region. “Despite its size it has developed an articulated metropolitan governance system that responds to its specific economic, environmental and social challenges with one of the most sophisticated and efficient integrated public transport system in the world,” declared a report by the LSE Urban Age programme.Cycle-share systems haven’t made huge inroads into Tokyo, but only because so many people already have bikes of their own, which can be parked in large automated lots at most key stations, solving the vaunted “last-mile” problem between home and public transport that bedevils many cities. Commuting full distances on bikes, however, is not encouraged in Tokyo the network of blue arrows painted on the streets for bike routes ahead of the Olympics is frequently interrupted by delivery vehicles, and seems basically token in nature.Bicycles could be better integrated into the city, argues Astrid Klein of Klein Dytham. “But we just love the seamless integration of cars, bikes and people in the smaller streets – a fuzzy soft logic. It’s no good having beautiful streets – say, the Victorian terraces of Chelsea in London – if you then allow cars to be double parked in front of them. In Japan there is no on-road parking, which keeps the roads free of ugly cars and allows pavements to be free.”Sorensen points out that there is a danger of ascribing Japan’s much-vaunted social stability to something inherent in Japanese culture, as opposed to wealth. It could also mean ignoring the marginalised groups that aren’t easily heard in a consensus-driven society, says Prichard.“On the one hand, relative to other cities, Tokyo is in fact quite remarkable, the essential support networks of a liberal welfare state remain operative and have so far survived the neoliberal plunder seen in other cities in ‘advanced’ states. But without the tireless struggles of many people this would not have been the case,” he said.“Discovering the forces at play in sustaining the benefits of this stability would include telling the stories of those who worked to make the state accountable to the people, including the erse histories of the movements for gender equality, resident Korean rights movements, environmental movements, anti-hate speech movements, labour movements, and many more.”Despite the wonders of the transit system, Tokyo also remains a massive city with difficult commutes, and a demanding work culture. “There are plenty of people enduring four or five hours on a severely overcrowded train each day as they struggle to get between their workplace and their in one of the far-flung suburbs,” says Gill. “Flextime? Working from home? These practices have been around for half a century, but very few major Japanese employers make use of them. So the misery of the daily commute continues.”Regardless of whether it’s useful to speak of Tokyo as a “peak city”, everyone agrees on one thing: change is inevitable.“The dominant features of the version of Tokyo we have now are only a few decades old. So the stasis and stability we perceive is only legible from a narrowed time-frame,” says Prichard.Tokyo is, like all cities, subject to external forces: “While Tokyo is exceptional in many ways, it is also deeply connected to other cities (and non-cities) in Japan and worldwide. Despite the best efforts of planners and politicians, the forces at play in the conditions favourable to this narrowly framed stability are by no means under control. The flux of regional and global flows of ideas, goods, and people, as well as the uncalculated human and environmental costs of this fraught equilibrium, remain to be determined.”Sorensen, too, emphasises the importance of understanding 2019 Tokyo as a snapshot of a particular moment in time. “The basic problem of the suggestion that Tokyo’s current housing affordability (compared to comparable cities like New York, Mumbai, London, Shanghai and Paris) represents a sweet spot of ‘stability and equilibrium’ is that this is a snapshot view that is devoid of historical perspective,” he said.“Cities always exist in time, and temporal processes and future expectations rule in property markets. This equilibrium seems to me a temporary and passing moment. Use value triumphs over exchange value, but asset values evaporate. How this will play out is unknown, and it will be worth watching this space. But celebrating this moment as an enviable period of balance seems a bit myopic.”“I do not feel comfortable calling Tokyo a peak city,” agrees Gill. “It is a very complex situation, and there are some positive aspects, notably the fact that it is now relatively inexpensive to live in Tokyo, certainly less expensive than London, and there’s no denying the low crime rate and feeling of safety when walking through Tokyo at night. However, you could just as easily argue that it has passed its peak, and is dragging the rest of Japan down with it.” Cities is live in Tokyo for a special week of in-depth reporting.

US officials briefed that it was “highly likely” Iran had attacked the Norwegian vessel and another tanker in the Gulf of Oman, close to the strait of Hormuz – a chokepoint for the global oil and gas trade. They had already blamed Tehran for mine attacks on other oil ships last month.Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, was quick to tweet that “suspicious doesn’t begin to describe what likely transpired this morning”, pointing out that vessels with cargo for Japan were attacked as the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, met the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a trip intended to help ease US-Iran tensions. In reality, the question of who is actually responsible is subsumed by two more: who is held responsible, and who created the context for these attacks, which would have been unthinkable a year ago but now seem disturbing rather than surprising. Iran has plenty to answer for in the region, most of all perhaps in Syria. But it is the US that walked away from an international nuclear deal by which Iran was abiding, motivated largely it seems by Donald Trump’s allergy to any success by his predecessor. With ultra-hawk John Bolton at the helm, and egged on by the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, the US has pursued “maximum pressure”, strangling Iran’s economy and sending other threatening signals even as it says it would negotiate. The only real restraint on the president seems to be his promise to voters to save them from expensive Middle Eastern wars, and perhaps his desire to prove he is a better dealmaker than Barack Obama.Yet as the jump in global oil prices following the attacks shows, Iran may not be the only one to suffer from the tensions. The US decision to disown the Iran nuclear deal and undermine its remnants strengthened hardliners in Iran and undermined moderates. Mr Zarif warned on Tuesday that the US “cannot expect to stay safe” after launching an economic war against Tehran. The supreme leader’s spate of tweets to Mr Abe sent a far more uncompromising message. Mr Trump is not a person deserving of an exchange of messages the US could not stop Iran producing nuclear weapons the US cannot be trusted.China, focusing on its own troubles with the US, has not filled the economic gap as Tehran hoped. Iran is growing increasingly frustrated despite Europe’s efforts to shore up the nuclear deal. Though the UK, France and Germany have created the Instex mechanism to enable trading, it looks more like a political statement than an effective mechanism at present. Iran wants a serious injection of seed funding, which might persuade it to pause on its current path of escalation.In the US, Congress has limited powers to constrain the administration, but can and should at least use its ability to increase and highlight the political costs of America’s current course. It has finally shown its willingness to take a stand over the war in Yemen.It seems extremely unlikely that Tehran has any hubristic inclination to confront the US directly. Yet at present there is no sign that either side is willing to halt the escalation. Last month, after the first tanker attacks, the British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, warned of the risk of a conflict happening “by accident”. An attack that causes mass fatalities, or any American death, could send this precarious situation over the edge. The blaze on Front Altair could yet turn out to presage a wider conflagration in the region, the devastating consequences of which could not be confined to Iran."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21e5f2cdcac00c4bd5fe1db13d4646a75691b0fb/0_389_2214_1328/master/2214.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0db0ee6d718a96f3ed2eb3aeab95034c","title":"coffee finance experts","story":"I get notifications on my phone whenever I use my bank card and this week, while undertaking a mini-audit, I noted that I was doing something that apparently leads to financial ruin. The other morning, in a bakery on Broadway, I spent $8.70 on non-essential pastries. A few hours later, in spite of the loaf of bread in my house, I threw down $8.25 at Pick A Bagel. And scattered throughout the day, like small distress flares sent up from my current account, was a notification trail of $3.77 coffees.It’s not the first time a wealthy investment analyst has characterised coffee drinking as feckless spending. A few years ago, Shark Tank judge, billionaire wealth manager and nightmare human being Kevin O’Leary told CNBC: “Do I pay $2.50 for a coffee? Never, never, never do I do that. That is such a waste of money for something that costs 20 cents. I never buy a frappe-latte-blah-blah-blah-woof-woof-woof for $2.50.” Instead, he said, he drank coffee at home and invested the difference, as a way of “maintaining growth in my own personal investing”.Most of us understand this to be a narrow definition of personal investing. You definitely don’t need that coffee. Nor do you need brunch of any kind, ever. You don’t need to go to the movies when there’s TV at home, and why have kids when you could maintain growth in your personal investing by putting the money in a Roth IRA instead? The gimlet-eyed joylessness of an old age spent reliving all the wonderful ways in which you saved money is certainly one to look forward to. O, reason not the need.On the other hand, I’ve always liked Orman and quite admire her for doing the maths on this. In other circumstances, most of us would not, probably, reserve a whole lot of love for Starbucks and might even admit the chain is bleeding us dry. For all that Orman and O’Leary are advocating self-denial in the pursuit of making more money, the puritan in me quite likes their jabs at consumerist spending. Iced coffee season is upon us in New York and the sheer volume of people wandering around sucking on straws like pacifiers is a reminder of just how bananas many of us are, nursing an apparently constant need to be consuming all day. I went to a meeting on Tuesday and although I was running late, I swerved into a coffee shop on the way because for some atavistic reason that might once have been fixed by smoking, I wanted the security blanket of a large, sweating cup in my hand. It was a nervous tic, and not a particularly good one.It’s not the money I resent, although there is that. It’s the consumption as blind reflex and the equation of that reflex with comfort. No matter how unpalatable the source of the advice, it might be a good idea to take another look at the habit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9975d2226a6a407268eecbc4315453bcc85c21c/0_9_3047_1828/master/3047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=212b682b55f2a5d41bc8212a05f58cbf","title":"response to grenfell windrush","story":"Last month Peter Mason, the chair of the Barking Reach residents’ association, contacted the builder Bellway Homes, requesting an investigation into the fire risk at his block of flats, following a BBC Watchdog report that revealed fire safety problems at two other Bellway developments. The company reassured him there was nothing to worry about. The wooden cladding had been treated so that it would take 30 minutes before a fire could take hold. “We understand that these news articles are highly alarming for all residents of new homes,” the company responded. “And I hope that the above statement has allayed any fears you may have over the safety and construction of your Bellway home.”On Sunday the cladding at De Pass Gardens, part of the Barking Reach development, caught fire in 70 seconds and soon consumed the building. Andrew Boff, the chair of the planning committee on the London Assembly, who lives opposite and was on the scene to help rescue people, told the London Evening Standard there was “no alarm and of course no sprinklers”. Miraculously, nobody died.The very next day, at an event in parliament to commemorate the second anniversary of the Grenfell fire, in which 72 people died and a further 70 were injured, Willie Thompson, a former Grenfell resident, confronted the housing secretary, James Brokenshire. “There’s another Grenfell in the post and it is going to land on your door. You guys are doing almost nothing. Does it take another Grenfell?”Tragically, given this government’s attitude to working people, wavering between the callous and the capricious, and a broader state of civic ennui, it might.The state’s culpability in this regard is clear. As my colleague Robert Booth has reported, in the two years since the fire, the public inquiry into what happened at Grenfell has not reported (and will not until October) tens of thousands of people still live in blocks covered in the same highly flammable cladding and despite Theresa May’s promise that everyone would be rehoused within three weeks, 17 families remain in temporary accommodation, with one in a hotel. Nobody has been held accountable and police investigations into potential manslaughter and health and safety violations aren’t expected until 2021.Natasha Elcock of Grenfell United has described the lack of progress as “beyond frustrating. Is it incompetence or is it indifference?” she asked the . Two years on, it feels nigh impossible to parse the two. Indeed it seems like the latter makes the former possible. It is the government’s indifference that makes it incompetent. It’s not an issue of capacity. It could fix these things if it wanted to. But it doesn’t care enough.In that sense, precious little has changed. From the outset Grenfell was a charred and gruesome monument to neglect. Not benign neglect – the absent-minded inattention of those who did not know, failed to prioritise or were engaged elsewhere – but malign: the knowing and wilful lack of interest of a political, rentier and media class that were aware of the issues but unmoved until tragedy forced them to respond.But it was also true in a broader metaphorical sense. The protective cladding – lethal to those who lived in it, decorative to the mostly wealthy neighbours who had to look at it – said it all. This is the country we now live in. This fatal blaze in the heart of Britain’s wealthiest borough signalled the brazen arrival of the four horsemen of late-stage capitalism: inequality, austerity, deregulation and privatisation.All illusions about where that toxic blend of policies and trajectories might lead went up in flames that night. With austerity causing an estimated 130,000 preventable deaths since 2012, putting profit before people is a principle some are willing to champion to death. But politicians are rarely directly confronted with the human cost of their ideology on such a scale. When they are, they are likely to gag like a meat-eater in an abattoir. May’s refusal to meet survivors in the days immediately following the fire was emblematic of her inability to engage, empathise or relate.There’s an obscenity to the Tory leadership race, in which candidates parade their tax-cutting credentials when the need for more social housing, safety inspectors and housing officers is so painfully evident.But to blame this entirely on the government and Conservatives would be too easy. The Grenfell fire took place less than a week after the last election, and in the last seat to declare a result – a shocking 20-vote victory to Labour in a seat no one imagined it had a chance in at the outset. Labour had campaigned against austerity the Tories had lost their majority. Put bluntly, there was significant public pressure that went beyond those directly affected.Part of the reason the government has managed to backslide is because that pressure was not sustained. Grenfell is not alone in this regard. The same thing has happened with Windrush – which pricked the national conscience for a few weeks and then receded from the conversation. But just because people stop talking about an injustice doesn’t make the injustice disappear – indeed, it’s precisely because they stop talking about it that it’s liable to persist.Within a year of the scandal breaking, Amber Rudd was back in the cabinet and the government had resumed the deportations of people who had every right to be here. Meanwhile, only 13 people have been given any assistance from the hardship fund set up to help Windrush victims struggling with destitution since they were illegally and improperly stripped of their citizenship. That’s just one more person than the number who were wrongly deported and then died before the government could even apologise.Just last week Glyn Williams, the architect of the “hostile environment” policy that made the Windrush scandal possible, was made knight commander of the order of Bath in the honours list.The nation’s capacity for indignation is apparently rivalled only by its propensity for distraction. It’s not that we don’t see injustice or cannot comprehend it. It’s that we apparently get bored by it. We are becoming very careless with our innocence: we keep losing it, only to find it again in time to be “shocked” by the next outrage.Grenfell was not only predictable, it was predicted. It did not “take” that tragedy to teach us what happens when negligent landlords and shoddy builders come together in an age of cost-cutting and regulatory ambivalence. We already knew. But it has raised the question whether we, as a society, cared enough to do anything about it. So long as a similar tragedy could happen tomorrow, the answer is a shameful no."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e35b3e3f417a50692318cb238becf69b259cd316/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7ee08929aa0b877c8e63a47e2fc9cc7","title":"making the mundane must have prada and the art of the fashion meme","story":"The Italian fashion house’s recent analogue-tech inspired show demonstrated how treading the line between the sublime and the ridiculous can spark a social media frenzy – and get everyone talkingForget The Devil Wears Prada – the Italian luxury fashion house looks to have drawn on The IT Crowd for inspiration at its recent Shanghai-based springsummer 2020 show.Designer Miuccia Prada appeared keen to equip fans of the brand with everything they might need for an IT conference in 1989: the show’s standout print was a repeating retro pattern of floppy discs, boom boxes and cassette tapes, printed on jackets in black and beige. It gave the young, clean-shaven models a boyish innocence and none of the looks would have seemed out of place in an episode of Stranger Things, each one social media catnip.Prada has form in making the mundane must-have last year the label was responsible for turning the lanyard into the summer’s hottest accessory. Although Miuccia said that the location of the show hadn’t influenced the collection, it was hard to ignore the irony of the analogue aesthetic in a country known for driving technological innovation. And it highlighted her ability to harness social media meme-dom as a marketing tool. The self-conscious ugliness of brands such as Prada drives people to social media to ridicule it (free advertising), while making those who wear Prada feel as if they’re in on the joke.The same thinking applies to some of fashion’s more outre looks. Take the autumnwinter 2018 collaboration between Moncler and Craig Green, that pushed the idea of the puffer jacket to the extreme – garnering comparisons with the Michelin man, a walking sleeping bag and a tampon. At London fashion week men’s on Monday, Green’s show had some models dressed as huge children’s party decorations or Mexican Easter flags (he has won British Menswear designer of the year for the past three years).Similarly, French It-designer Simon Porte Jacquemus has a penchant for pieces that are likely to go viral. His “mini chiquito” bag nestles comfortably into the palm of one hand while his “la Bomba” hat would provide enough shade for a family of four.Graduate designers are also adopting this strategy. Last week, Central Saint Martin’s Fedrik Tjærandsen’s inflating and deflating “balloon” dresses went viral, and Vogue dubbed Tjærandsen a “groundbreaking talent”.The approach implies that key to a designer’s success in the social media age is finding that sweet spot between being lightly ridiculed online and adored by the fashion crowd. Despite Miuccia Prada’s championing of all things analogue, she is likely well aware of the role modern technology plays in her label’s success."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a91c33e8f32eaf1ceacf8208c9c4f49c1ecfb215/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e28d33cf0f92b5b1f893c55474b4634","title":"the best dresses for all ages in pictures","story":"The perfect summer dress is not a one-size-fits-all affair.

What can I say? I was a 15-year-old girl! I cried my heart out every time. I remember sitting in the first row on opening night because it was otherwise completely sold out. Then I watched it again with friends, and again and again I watched it alone. I went to see it so often the local cinema gave me a free ticket to watch the last showing: I just loved the experience. It was a movie so epic, and until then everyone thought they don’t make them like that any more.I haven’t seen it lately but when my daughters are old enough I will try to find a cinema showing. It won’t be the same for them, of course, but it has to be seen and it is truly a movie that belongs on the big screen. Stephi, AustriaMy friend and I made 17 trips to Leeds city centre to revel in the greatness. Why? The sheer fun of the film, the soundtrack, everything encapsulated who we were at that moment in time. We even managed to collect a fair bit of memorabilia.We went so often that on our last visit we only noticed the rest of the audience’s 3D glasses when the film began. It turned out after 16 viewings in the “main” screen we had been relegated, and had to highfoot it to get to number 17 in time. Stu, AustraliaI couldn’t wait for Grease to be released in September 1978. You’re the One That I Want had topped the charts all summer and every Thursday I’d sit waiting to see the video on Top of the Pops. The world of Rydell High in the 50s was a world away from a 70s Edinburgh council estate. Then a rumour started that Grease would be classified AA, meaning nobody under 14 could see it. I was gutted. Luckily that was wrong, it was an A, and I spent the next 32 Saturday afternoons at the ABC cinema, Lothian Road, watching first a 20-minute short film about skateboarding that had Chris Montez’s Let’s Dance as its theme, then came Danny and Sandy at the beach, Love Is a Many Splendored Thing playing in the background, before the cartoon credits rolled. Sam, EdinburghAfter the whole debacle between Netflix and established cinema chains across the world, I was happy to see that the EYE Filmmuseum in Amsterdam was showing Alfonso Cuáron’s Roma. Not only that, but the screening was in their state-of-the-art Cinema 1, with 4K resolution and beautiful, crisp surround sound. This elevates the already profound experience of Roma to a whole new level: you can feel yourself in the busy streets of Mexico City.I went several times, and took different friends each time. We pretty much all agreed that Roma was meant to be seen on a big screen, with great sound, rather than a tiny computer screen and tinny speakers. This is the kind of film that asks for complete immersion into a time, setting and aesthetic – it is a shame that it couldn’t be experienced that way by the majority of the public. J Medina, AmsterdamI went to see this film six times in the two weeks it played at our local Unit 4. That first time, it took my breath away – I’d never seen anything as captivating. Everything, from the premise to the music, the actors and the action itself (the fight scenes especially) was a revelation to this small-town 20-year-old. Thrilling.I also fell in love with one of the extras, which must’ve been part of the draw (the young woman with the long blonde hair in the Lizzies scene). A week later, myself and a group of friends went to see it again in Rawtenstall: we were passing joints around when suddenly the lights came on and police streamed in and frogmarched us out, into waiting vans. Busted! Martin Peacock, AccringtonWhile I saw the 1982 theatrical cut on TV and really liked it, I fell in love with the director’s cut and saw it four times in two weeks when it was released in cinemas in 1992. This doesn’t sound like much, but if you consider the three different versions of Blade Runner to be “one film”, then I’ve seen it over 20 times at the cinema. They could release a fourth version tomorrow with the only difference being a one-second cut to an incidental scene and I’d be the first to buy a ticket.You really can’t beat seeing those stunning visuals on the big screen and hearing Vangelis’s gorgeous soundtrack in the theatre. I’m lucky that the Astor in Melbourne screens it about once a year, although there’s not one currently scheduled for 2019 (strange given that’s the year the movie is set). Neill Brown, MelbourneI see new details and nuances each time. Recently, for example, I noticed the wire rakes in the garden shop Marion’s boyfriend works in, and their resemblance to skeletal claws. But why was such an image planted there, rather than in the Bates Motel? This kicked off a line of enquiry I will take into my next viewing. I also find seeing the film each time with a new audience helps me to experience it in its totality quite differently. Recent viewings have opened my eyes to its sly humour. Emotionally, I identify with those in the audience seeing the film for the first time and share with them the frisson of its unravelling. Alex, LondonMy 16-year-old daughter and I completely fell in love with this film (we were seeing a lot of Bollywood films at the time), and returned at least six times over the course of a couple of weeks, taking with us various reluctant friends each time. We loved the adventurous characters (played by Abhishek Bachchan and Rani Mukerji) and their slow-burn romance, the high-spirited (but never mean-spirited) capers they ran, and their pursuit by a wily cop played by legendary superstar Amitabh Bachchan (Abhishek’s father). We adored the music, lusted after the clothes, and never got tired of it, even after we knew the Hindi dialogue by heart. Laura Boyes, North CarolinaI stumbled on Annie Proulx’s short story and it captivated me. I was in my mid 40s when the movie was released and I went to see it solo at a matinee here in San Francisco. I was so moved I was shaking when I left the cinema and, afraid I was going to burst into tears, had to hide behind a pillar to smoke a cigarette. My hand was trembling as I tried to light it.I went back seven times, sometimes alone and sometimes with friends. I became fixated on certain scenes and would watch them over and over again on YouTube – the story really got under my skin and I spent a year on IMDb discussing it with other fans. Trevor Martin, San FranciscoI turned 20 in the summer of 1989 and went crazy for Tim Burton’s first Batman film. Maybe because it was the first “proper” superhero film since Superman II … maybe it was because it had a great soundtrack by Prince and a moody score by Danny Elfman (I bought both albums on various formats) and maybe because I loved the sartorial choices on display (double-breasted suits and 40s fedoras), but I couldn’t get enough of it.At the time I had a girlfriend in Venice, and when I went in October to visit her the movie had just been released there. Naturally, we went to see the film on a date (her first viewing, my eighth). When we came out she said she loved the moment when Bruce Wayne got shot through his jacket and didn’t notice. My jaw dropped. I’d seen the film so many times and hadn’t noticed that detail. I saw it again recently and I felt no wave of nostalgia, just a sense of huge disappointment. “Is that it?” I thought.

Not nearly as awful as it could have been.Probably the best – or least bad – of Caine’s late-70s-into-the-80s do-anything-for-money period, which included Beyond the Poseidon Adventure and Ashanti. The Swarm is actually pretty nifty: an insect-based carve-up from disaster-master Irwin Allen, featuring killer bees cutting a swathe through Texas. Caine is the prof who works out how to destroy them.A pretty straightforward rip-off of The French Connection, but entertainingly paying homage to the great French gangster movie tradition. Caine and co-star Anthony Quinn are namechecking leads Deray and Ventura, a killer-for-cash and American agent out to take down James Mason’s drug baron.Christopher Nolan’s ancestor worship has given Caine a late-career fillip. His role, as the boffin running a super-secret space agency in Nolan’s ambitious attempt to emulate Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, is a sort of autopilot-gravitas.Caine didn’t think much of Mike Hodges’ follow-up to Get Carter it’s very much not the lean, mean neo-noir that they managed for Carter. Pulp regained some critical credibility in the 90s (not least because of its title similarity to Pulp Fiction) and its labyrinthine literary musings look more interesting now.It was perhaps inevitable that Caine would show up in Mike Myers’ 60s-spy spoof: he plays Nigel, Austin and Evil’s dad, who is still the bum-pinching dinosaur of yore. Broad comedy mugging isn’t really Caine’s strength, but he gets through it fine.Caine issued a public call to be cast in a movie about the Hatton Garden job, and the result was pretty classy, compared with most of the geezer-gangster landfill of the past two decades. Caine skilfully brings out the inner desolation of his character even if the surrounding film’s attempt to humanise the robbers never quite hits high gear.Long considered a disaster – not least by Caine himself, who said he was forced into making it for legal reasons – this now comes across as the nuttiest of psychedelic period pieces, alternately baffling and flabbergasting. On some level Caine seems totally out of place, but that actually suits the bonkers material.Brian De Palma accumulated mucho trash points with this Psycho homage, even if its roll-up of dissociative identity disorder and trans-baiting, suspect back then, looks much worse now. But it was a real out-there choice for Caine, showing he was willing to break the boundaries of what was considered a safe role. Trigger warnings very much required nowadays.One of Caine’s better attempts to resuscitate his Harry Palmer persona: a cold-war thriller adapted from a Frederick Forsyth novel that managed to beat the Berlin wall coming down by a mere two years.Caine played third fiddle to Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale in Christopher Nolan’s fifth feature, as another avuncular mentor figure who is given the all-important clip-worthy montage that explains how magic tricks work. He gets the required feels, even if he is a bit overshadowed by Nolan’s directorial fireworks.This should have been a stone cold classic: Caine in his early-70s pomp, Don Siegel directing, more gritty Harry Palmerisms. Caine holds the screen effortlessly (despite those ugly aviator specs he liked), but there’s something laborious about the spy-game thriller he’s been inserted into.Surprisingly impressive entry in the feral-council-estate-kids cycle of the mid-2000s, mostly due to Caine’s fervent commitment to the role as he transforms from realist-misery pensioner to creaky-limbed killing machine. It’s still bit of a Kipper’s revenge fantasy, though.Caine won his second Oscar (for best supporting actor) for this Lasse Hallström adaptation of John Irving’s novel he plays the ether-addicted orphanage director (and secret abortionist) Wilbur Larch. Caine is very good (despite his customary wobbly accent), but the social politics of the movie have dated horribly.Caine at bay is always an impressive sight, and here he gives it up in spades as an on-the-run wartime collaborator, protected by secretive church organisations from assassins who are out to get revenge. A well-made, if fundamentally old-fashioned drama, the interesting historical background underpins good work from Caine.Greenlighting a sequel to The Ipcress File was as easy as winking, and hiring Goldfinger’s director, Guy Hamilton, showed which way the producers wanted to go. Perhaps that explains why this Berlin-set spy game is a touch stodgier than its predecessor: Harry Palmer should be lighter on his feet than 007.Caine wouldn’t work with just anybody, you know: Nolan already had three features under his belt, and had directed Al Pacino. But Caine coming on board this Batman origins film was a real coup for the director, as well as re-engaging interest of a new generation of filmgoers for the actor. The butler role – another kindly tough-nut – didn’t take the actor to new areas, but it is probably the one that will define his late-phase career.Who can honestly see Caine – or Hollywood – making something like this again? A cast-of-thousands epic set during the thirty years’ war, with Caine as the captain of a band of ruthless mercenaries who take over an untouched rural backwater in 17th-century Germany. Worth it if only for the sight of Caine in a spiked war helmet.Caine wasn’t too keen on this third instalment in the Harry Palmer series, calling his suggestion to hire Ken Russell “a mistake”. Even if Russell never got around to outlining the actual plot too clearly, Caine is on good form, with all that trademark insolence present and correct.By the mid-80s Caine was firmly established as a top-notch ensemble player. Alan Alda’s slightly supercilious Hollywood comedy – in which Caine played a lothario film star – is a fine example of how Caine’s perfectly pitched charm could quietly dominate, even with high-grade performers such as Michelle Pfeiffer and Bob Hoskins on hand.Caine proved a good sport as Sandra Bullock’s beauty-pageant instructor in this cop thriller with radioactive levels of Bullock-patented perkiness. To his credit, Caine dials back the campness levels (lesser actors, no doubt, would have detonated the scale) it remains his most unlikely mentor-type role.Caine’s career was at a low-ish ebb in the mid-90s, but this ensemble noir from Bob “Five Easy Pieces” Rafelson stands out. Sporting another dodgy tache, Caine is excellent in a small-but-key role as Jack Nicholson’s safe-cracking partner in crime, as they go after a diamond necklace. A fine showcase for Caine’s amoral-ruthless qualities.An interesting step away from the sardonic thrillers and swinging-60s material that had made Caine a star. A sweaty, deep-south melodrama for Hollywood heavyweight director Otto Preminger, Caine played a racist speculator trying to diddle sharecroppers out of their land. One of the first signs that Caine was aiming for something bigger.By the mid-70s Caine was looking past lead roles: in this Sting-inspired period comedy he is well down the bill but still highly memorable, with more recent stars James Caan and Elliot Gould in the marquee roles. Caan and Gould are con artists aiming to beat Caine’s lordly bankrobber to a heist fun stuff.If one film shows that Caine really knew how to handle military grade weaponry, it’s this: a re-run by Robert Aldrich of his own hit movie The Dirty Dozen, about a British unit cut down fighting the Japanese in the Pacific islands. As the only survivor of a risky jungle mission (reflecting the current war in Vietnam), Caine channelled his own combat experience in Korea he looks pretty convincing.In an attempt to reinvigorate his Hollywood career after its late 70s downturn, Caine tried a bit of horror – then a modish option for actors on the slide. Caine chose wisely: this creepy little number about a comic book illustrator whose severed hand becomes an unstoppable killing machine was Oliver Stone’s first Hollywood film as director.Caine had already appeared in the cameo-stuffed The Wrong Box for director Bryan Forbes two years later he was a bona fide leading man, and took the main role in Forbes’ arty caper thriller. Its sexual politics look a little crass today, but Caine’s heavy-lidded charm holds it together.A somewhat forgotten entry in Joseph Losey’s canon, very much in the Antonioni style – lush, chilly interiors, moody set pieces and quizzical meditations on sex and the creative process. Caine brings conviction to his role as a novelist and husband to Glenda Jackson, who is contemplating having it away with a drug dealer in a Baden Baden spa hotel.No doubt feeling the pace of keeping a leading-man career going into its second decade, Caine’s participation in this Neil Simon ensemble piece was one of his first attempts to ersify. It allowed him to stretch and play against type. Here he is a gay antique dealer, in a marriage of convenience to Maggie Smith’s Oscar nominee, but unwilling to conceal his sexuality.Caine had a small but vivid role in Alfonso Cuarón’s ambitious dystopian satire again, very much against type as an ageing hippy and dope farmer. Caine apparently based his scruffy long-haired character on John Lennon and – almost unrecognisable – happily farts and sparks up a fat one.A war movie of quite extraordinary cynicism , in which the British higher-ups betray their own men to the Germans for strategic purposes an anti-establishment broadside that suited Caine’s late-60s mood perfectly. He plays posh: an oil executive attached to a unit of irregulars operating behind enemy lines in the north African desert. A real gut punch of a movie.If you can get past the male-gaze sleaziness of parts of Paolo Sorrentino’s melancholy fable, there’s a fine, wintry performance from Caine as an elderly composer spending time at a health spa for a check-up. As the title ironically indicates, this is all about the dying of the light, facing up to the end – and ruminating on the missed possibilities along the way.Like many of Caine’s 60s and 70s films, there’s a barrel-load of obsolescent cultural baggage to avert your eyes from – largely, in this case, stemming from the casting of Shirley MacLaine as a biracial showgirl called Nicole Chang. That said, this is otherwise a properly charming caper movie, with perceptible chemistry between him and MacLaine.Caine largely swerved the Brit-cinema revival of the mid- and late-90s, but he did do this adaptation of Jim Cartwright’s stage hit about a painfully shy homebody with a fantastic singing voice. Caine, as her raddled manager Ray Say, is fine – until, that is, he is elevated to magnificence with Ray’s astounding onstage meltdown, belting out It’s Over and shouting obscenities at an unimpressed talent scout. Genuinely extraordinary.Caine’s credentials as a heavyweight dramatic actor began to emerge in the early 80s this, along with Educating Rita, helped him make the transition. Caine is magnificent as Graham Greene’s alcoholic British diplomat, venal but remorseful as he grapples with his own failings.Caine’s casting in this, his first substantial film role, is the stuff of legend: called in to read for a working-class trooper, he emerged with the plum role of the officer-class Gonville Bromhead. Very much a passion project for the star, Stanley Baker, this heroic rendering of the battle of Rorke’s Drift has passed into Sunday teatime territory, even if many of its cultural assumptions look pretty shaky now. Caine made the most of the opportunity, though, in full damn-your-eyes mode.Of Caine’s vast back catalogue of second world war movies, this is probably the one that will endure. Adapted from a Jack Higgins novel, bearing a certain resemblance to Went the Day Well?, this has Caine as a sort-of good German leading a mission to infiltrate an English village and assassinate Churchill. It’s absorbing, well-crafted stuff, directed by John “The Great Escape” Sturges Caine, as ever, finds a way to dominate the film, and manifest an unlikely power of performance.A real hit in the UK, this adaptation of Willy Russell’s stage play made a star of its female lead, Julie Walters, but also confirmed Caine’s transition to a dramatic actor of substance. As a character – a middle-aged, jaded alcoholic – Caine’s Open University prof is not all that different from the one in The Honorary Consul, released the same year the narrative arc here is, however, rather more obviously redemptive and uplifting.A con artist movie in all but name, this saw Caine very much hold his own opposite Laurence Olivier – both were nominated for the best actor Oscar – as a cocky hairdresser duelling with Olivier’s jealous crime writer over who can freak out the other most successfully. Caine clearly liked the two-hander format, chalking up a string of impressive examples over the years, but this is the first, and one of the best.An unlikely subject for a film: a carload of grumpy old men taking the ashes of their dead friend to be scattered in Margate. From this, as explored in Graham Swift’s Booker prize-winning novel, writer-director Fred Schepisi wove an inexpressibly moving tapestry of memory and good fellowship, loyalty and thwarted hopes. Caine is the dead friend, seen (obviously) in flashback his ability to lead even the strongest ensemble cast (which included Tom Courtenay, Helen Mirren, Ray Winstone and Bob Hoskins) was never bettered.Another leftfield choice that showed Caine wasn’t afraid to take a chance: big stars didn’t do movies with puppets. This could easily have been a disaster, but Caine absolutely nails it as Scrooge his customary total commitment to a role undeterred by the presence of Kermit, Miss Piggy and the rest. It’s the seriousness with which he takes it that’s the key: Caine said he would play it like Shakespeare, and he did.Of all the roles Caine played, you get the feeling he felt most personal kinship – at least in the early years as an actor – with Charlie Croker, the upstart bank robber whose overseas multimillion-pound heist is reconfigured by the film-makers as a reassertion of national pride and the revenge of the Little Englander in the age of vanishing empire. In some ways even more of a Kipper fantasy than Harry Brown, the compensation here is a tremendous sugar rush of entertainment.Caine made one of his rare 80s forays back home to play third fiddle to Bob Hoskins and Cathy Tyson in Neil Jordan’s undeniably haunting thriller. Even if he isn’t the main man, the role he plays – icily sleazy pimp Mortwell – is thoroughly memorable in its sheer nastiness.With The Honorary Consul, Caine had proved he could do Graham Greene, and the mood of compromise and self-reproach that it entailed. He is even better in this one, an adaptation of Greene’s excoriation of American exceptionalism in south-east Asia (a theme that proved unpopular in the aftermath of the World Trade Center attacks, when the film was originally supposed to be released). Caine’s attention to detail as he summons up the mood of conflicted melancholy secured an Oscar nomination.Caine played a fair few charming upper-class rogues in his time – mostly for Hollywood, it has to be said – and this is arguably the best: a Riviera-based swindler who latches on to rich women and relieves them of their cash. The presence of Steve Martin as his partnerrival elevates this comedy to classic status and, if the twist ending with Glenne Headly isn’t exactly a surprise, it’s all beautifully managed.This, more than Alfie, was the film that made Caine a star, and it is still absolutely terrific. Audiences got their first look at Caine’s deadpan, lizard-like charm, leavened with his then-modish street accent, which positioned him as a key player in the 60s culture wars. It also helps, of course, that it’s just a fantastically exciting thriller, with director Sidney J Furie going into overdrive as well as being a stylistic counterpoint to the flashier Bond films, it’s also much less bloated.If Ipcress got Caine front and centre, Alfie was the film that came to define his onscreen persona, at least at first. As the blazer-wearing, permacheating roué of the title, Caine perfectly encapsulated the boundary-pushing moral mood of the time – though in truth, this is a film about the failures and bleakness of the permissive lifestyle. Caine might not have been an absolute natural in the role – Terence Stamp, who turned down the film after playing the part on stage, would possibly have been a little more so – but Caine’s slight awkwardness arguably makes for more interesting drama. And it’s hard to see how Caine’s confidence in the direct-address bits could have been better.As the 70s dawned, Caine was incontrovertibly a big international star. His “coming home” to do a small-scale Brit gangster film was as much an event as Jack Carter heading back to Newcastle to sort out his brother’s killers. Conceived as a quantum leap forward in the way British organised crime was represented on screen – violent, nasty and businesslike – Get Carter emerged as a modern classic, with Caine a towering figure with a laser-like focus on getting the job done, both as a character and an actor.In retrospect, this looks like the first of a stream of pass-agg breakup notes Woody Allen was sending to Mia Farrow: Caine’s role, of a man so disgusted by Farrow’s niceness he has to go off and have an affair with someone in the immediate family, is a cleverly disguised Allen surrogate (given Allen is also in the film, playing a discontented TV writer). Notwithstanding the tsunami of bile that has swept over Allen since, this remains a richly observed drama, Chekhovian in its sweep and a testament to why Allen was (and still should be) regarded as a great film-maker. As ever making only the most perfunctory attempts to do the relevant accent, Caine’s ability to dredge vulnerability out of himself resulted in a quite extraordinary, even revelatory performance for once, an Oscar no one could argue with.Characteristically for Caine, collaboration brings out his absolute best. His double act with Sean Connery, in roles originally intended for Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart, is electrifying in absolutely the best way this is arguably Connery’s career high, too. Who knows how the American actors would have played it, but with Caine on board it became another upstart fable, the put-upon worker drones managing – at first, at least – to outsmart the boss class to grab a little loot for themselves. Of course, The Man Who Would Be King is a near textbook example of be careful what you wish for like The Italian Job, cliffs and gold play their part. There’s an extra resonance for contemporary audiences: this imperial-era study of the north-west frontier provides a lot of context for the current unrest in Afghanistan and Pakistan. (The naked racism on display, which undergoes a Kiplingesque modulation as the story progresses, is a similar eye-opener.) For Caine specifically, his screen charisma was never deployed better: crafty, resolute and empathetic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abc29ab342c906c41e52b1753602419250e7de53/0_0_5619_3371/master/5619.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9266b54aa4b7741f2210504448c0983b","title":"jay rayner dad ahead of his time except cooking","story":"Despite his dreadful wurst omelette, my father taught me a great deal – not least how to be a good dadRecently, my eldest messaged me a photograph from the kitchen of his student house. It was of a bowl of ramen. There were the curling noodles, like cross-stitch, bobbing in a broth the colour of copper coins. There were the sliced spring onions and halved boiled egg, the yolk still running, the outside of the white fully bronzed from its long rest in a soy-based marinade. There was no commentary no “Look what I made” or “Fancy some?”. There didn’t need to be.It was a father-son thing. The two of us have eaten so much ramen together over the years, argued over the finer details of what makes a good one and laughed uproariously at the bad, that he knew I’d get it. He’d made his own ramen and he wanted me to see it. Obviously, I celebrated my glorious parenting skills. I had passed on the baton of fatherly enthusiasm. I’d given him both a love of the good stuff and a desire to make it for himself. Go me.But while I looked forward, I also looked back. I would never have shown my late father pictures of my cooking. Or, if I had, Des would have greeted it with a puzzled, knotted brow, as he scrambled for the right thing to say. When he died, almost exactly five years ago, I wrote about how Des had time for a good salt beef sandwich or well-made fish and chips, but otherwise shared none of my greedy interests. I concluded this was probably a good thing. It gave me a little perspective.What I didn’t mention then, shadowed by intense grief, was his complete failure as a cook. It drove me completely nuts, but back then I really didn’t want to be critical. It seemed at odds with a man who had been so ahead of his time. My mother had been the lead earner in our house and he had supported her, rather than the other way around. He had been fully involved in every detail of our upbringing.And yet, at the stove he was a disaster. If my mother was working and dinner duties ever fell to Des, I knew he’d be cracking out the wurst, a salty, blunt kosher beef salami, rendered a disturbing pink courtesy of God knows what, which despite our lack of religious observance, was always in the fridge. This, he would slice into thick rounds and fry. It would be served with a rubbery omelette made crimson from the leaking processed meat. It was terrible a meal wasted. I couldn’t help but feel my father was negligent in not having equipped himself with the necessary culinary skills.But as my own son has reached the age where he could start pinging food pics at me, I realise how unfair this was. Des was the product of a particularly feckless man – my grandfather – who wasn’t exactly on point when it came to the fathering business. Certainly, he was disdainful of men cooking or, indeed, basic expressions of love. To simply get into adulthood more or less in one piece was an achievement for my dad. Expecting souffle recipes or an intimate knowledge of roasting times as well would be unreasonable.My child, meanwhile, has had a privileged upbringing boasting lots of space in which to share the joy over the perfect bowl of ramen. Frankly, it would be surprising if my boy wasn’t pinging me images of steaming noodle bowls, just as my own dad’s lack of skills was also unsurprising. It would be convenient if I now announced that, this Father’s Day, to remember him, I’ll be knocking up a plate of wurst and eggs. I won’t. It really is an awful dish. But as a dad myself, I think I finally understand Des a little bit more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2aa091cf84cf6bd3c1a78f25678dcf29b4f3270/0_0_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0619985022b50eea1cfe47628d5fcb78","title":"progress on ending child labour stall in countries supplying goods to west","story":"China, India and Bangladesh among otherwise thriving countries failing to make headway on issue affecting 152 million minors Progress towards ending child labour has stalled in the countries most likely to be supplying goods to the west, a study has found.Despite high economic growth and big improvements in education and development, countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia have made little progress in tackling child labour.“The economic momentum of many countries is yet to trickle down to the poorest in society and any meaningful headway on labour rights issues, including child labour, remains elusive,” said Oscar Larsson, a human rights data analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, the risk analytics company that produced the analysis.Child labour victims number an estimated 152 million, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO), 73 million of whom work in hazardous conditions.Researchers ranked 198 countries based on their laws and adoption of international treaties, the ability and will to enforce them, and the frequency and severity of violations.The five highest-risk countries were North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Eritrea, and Central African Republic.The researchers also highlighted a rapidly escalating risk of child labour in Venezuela as a result of the country’s economic and political crisis. Venezuela has fallen 80 places in the index since 2016, and now ranks seventh highest in the rankings.Globally, 27 countries – with a total collective population of 900 million people – were ranked as having an “extreme risk” of child labour. A further 82 countries were categorised as “high risk” in the index, including China (ranked 98th) and India (47th).If the frequency and severity of violations are looked at in isolation, both countries are considered “extreme risk”.Violations refer to incidents where international treaties on child labour have been broken – for example, a child under 15 is found to be working in conditions that damage their development. Due to the hidden nature of such cases, the researchers estimated frequency by surveying a range of UN, ILO and NGO sources.Agriculture, manufacturing, apparel, construction, mining and hospitality all pose high levels of risk in both India and China, according to the study. Researchers also raised concern over the trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation of children.East Africa has five of the 10 highest risk countries globally, making it the region where children are most vulnerable, while 16 of the 27 “extreme risk” countries are in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the report.Cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a child labour magnet, according to Sam Haynes, head of risk indices at Maplecroft. He also identified coffee farming in Ghana as a high-risk sector.“In sub-Saharan Africa there’s a real mix of effectiveness of governments,” he said. “Some are trying to do good things but are failing because of the lack of effectiveness of the state.”Ben Smith, ILO’s senior specialist for child labour, said that, in absolute numbers, child labour in sub-Saharan Africa had overtaken child labour rates in Asia and the Pacific combined.The UN aims to end child labour of all forms by 2025 and has introduced measures such as cash transfer schemes for children who have to work due to their families falling on hard times.“At the current rate of decline we won’t get there. Child labour cannot wait, the need for assistance is now,” said Smith.“Agriculture is the flashpoint of the child labour problems. We need to accelerate and redouble efforts and make a breakthrough”, he added.Child labour is on the agenda at the International Labour Conference, held in Geneva until 21 June. ILO sets the minimum age for work at 15. Poorer countries can use 14 as an interim age, but children cannot be involved in hazardous work before they turn 18."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherWe’re looking for unusual partnerships – two people who live together in a way that shows the changing nature of the traditional household – for our new series that seeks to reflect how the place we call home can now include extended family, friends and even strangers.In the first piece in a series talking to pairs of people who live together we met the McPhersons, a grandmother and grandson living together who tell us their story.

This brings a bigger question: what does it mean to be genetically Jewish? And can you prove religious identity scientifically?After arriving in eastern Europe around a millennium ago, the company’s website explained, Jewish communities remained segregated, by force and by custom, mixing only occasionally with local populations. Isolation slowly narrowed the gene pool, which now gives modern Jews of European descent, like my family, a set of identifiable genetic variations that set them apart from other European populations at a microscopic level.This genetic explanation of my Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry came as no surprise. According to family lore, my forebears lived in small towns and villages in eastern Europe for at least a few hundred years, where they kept their traditions and married within the community, up until the Holocaust, when they were either murdered or dispersed.But still, there was something disconcerting about our Jewishness being “confirmed” by a biological test. After all, the reason my grandparents had to leave the towns and villages of their ancestors was because of ethno-nationalism emboldened by a racialized conception of Jewishness as something that exists “in the blood”.The raw memory of this racism made any suggestion of Jewish ethnicity slightly taboo in my family. If I ever mentioned that someone “looked Jewish” my grandmother would respond, “Oh really? And what exactly does a Jew look like?” Yet evidently, this wariness of ethnic categorization didn’t stop my parents from sending swab samples from the inside of their cheeks off to a direct-to-consumer genetic testing company. The idea of having an ancient identity “confirmed” by modern science was too alluring.Not that they’re alone. As of the beginning of this year, more than 26 million people have taken at-home DNA tests. For most, like my parents, genetic identity is assimilated into an existing life story with relative ease, while for others, the test can unearth family secrets or capsize personal narratives around ethnic heritage.But as these genetic databases grow, genetic identity is reshaping not only how we understand ourselves, but how we can be identified by others. In the past year, law enforcement has become increasingly adept at using genetic data to solve cold cases a recent study shows that even if you haven’t taken a test, chances are you can be identified by authorities via genealogical sleuthing.What is perhaps more concerning, though, is how authorities around the world are also beginning to use DNA to not only identify iniduals, but to categorize and discriminate against entire groups of people.In February of this year, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, reported that the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, the peak religious authority in the country, had been requesting DNA tests to confirm Jewishness before issuing some marriage licenses.In Israel, matrimonial law is religious, not civil. Jews can marry Jews, but intermarriage with Muslims or Christians is legally unacknowledged. This means that when a Jewish couple want to tie the knot, they are required by law to prove their Jewishness to the Rabbinate according to Orthodox tradition, which defines Jewish ancestry as being passed down through the mother.While for most Israeli Jews this simply involves handing over their mother’s birth or marriage certificate, for many recent immigrants to Israel, who often come from communities where being Jewish is defined differently or documentation is scarce, producing evidence that satisfies the Rabbinate’s standard of proof can be impossible.In the past, confirming Jewishness in the absence of documentation has involved contacting rabbis from the countries where people originate or tracking genealogical records back to prove religious continuity along the matrilineal line. But as was reported in Haaretz, and later confirmed by David Lau, the Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Israel, in the past year, the rabbis have been requesting that some people undergo a DNA test to verify their claim before being allowed to marry.For many Israelis, news that the rabbinical judges were turning to DNA testing was shocking, but for Seth Farber, an American-born Orthodox rabbi, it came as no surprise. Farber, who has been living in Israel since the 1990s, is the director of Itim, the Jewish Life Information Center, an organization that helps Israeli Jews navigate state-administered matters of Jewish life, like marriage and conversion. In the past year, the organization has seen up to 50 cases where families have been asked to undergo DNA tests to certify their Jewishness.Those being asked to take these tests, Farber told me, are mostly Russian-speaking Israelis, members of an almost 1 million-strong immigrant community who began moving to Israel from countries of the former Soviet Union in the 1990s. Due to the fact that Jewish life was forcefully suppressed during the Soviet era, many members of this community lack the necessary documentation to prove Jewishness through matrilineal descent. This means that although most self-identify as Jewish, hundreds of thousands are not considered so by the Rabbinate, and routinely have their Jewish status challenged when seeking religious services, including marriage.For almost two decades, Farber and his colleagues have advocated for this immigrant community in the face of what they see as targeted discrimination. In cases of marriage, Farber acts as a type of rabbinical lawyer, pulling together documentation and making a case for his clients in front of a board of rabbinical judges. He fears that DNA testing will place even more power in the hands of the Rabbinate and further marginalize the Russian-speaking community. “It’s as if the rabbis have become technocrats,” he told me. “They are using genetics to give validity to their discriminatory practices.”Despite public outrage and protests in central Tel Aviv, the Rabbinate have not indicated any intention of ending DNA testing, and reports continue to circulate in the Israeli media of how the test is being used. One woman allegedly had to ask her mother and aunt for genetic material to prove that she was not adopted. Another man was asked to have his grandmother, sick with dementia, take a test.Boris Shindler, a political activist and active member of the Russian-speaking community, told me that he believes that the full extent of the practice remains unknown, because many of those who have been tested are unwilling to share their stories publicly out of a sense of shame. “I was approached by someone who was married in a Jewish ceremony maybe 15, 20 years ago, who recently received an official demand saying if you want to continue to be Jewish, we’d like you to do a DNA test,” Shindler said. “They said if she doesn’t do it then she has to sign papers saying she is not Jewish. But she is too humiliated to go to the press with this.”What offends Shindler most is that the technique is being used to single out his community, which he sees as part of a broader stigmatization of Russian-speaking immigrants in Israeli society as unassimilated outsiders and second-class citizens. “It is sad because in the Soviet Union we were persecuted for being Jewish and now in Israel we’re being discriminated against for not being Jewish enough,” he said.But according to Yosef Carmel, an Orthodox rabbi and co-head of Eretz Hemdah, a Jerusalem-based institute that trains rabbinical judges for the Rabbinate, this is a misunderstanding of how the DNA testing is being used. He explained that the Rabbinate are not using a generalized Jewish ancestry test, but one that screens for a specific variant on the mitochondrial DNA – DNA that is passed down through the mother – that can be found almost exclusively in Ashkenazi Jews.For David Goldstein, professor of medical research in genetics at Columbia University whose 2008 book, Jacob’s Legacy: A Genetic View of Jewish History, outlines a decade’s worth of research into Jewish population genetics, translating scientific insights about small genetic variants in the DNA to normative judgments about religious or ethnic identity is not only problematic, but misunderstands what the science actually signals.“When we say that there is a signal of Jewish ancestry, it’s a highly specific statistical analysis done over a population,” he said. “To think that you can use these type of analyses to make any substantive claims about politics or religion or questions of identity, I think that it’s frankly ridiculous.”But others would disagree. As DNA sequencing becomes more sophisticated, the ability to identify genetic differences between human populations has improved. Geneticists can now locate variations in the DNA so acutely as to differentiate populations living on opposite sides of a mountain range.In recent years, a number of high-profile commentators have appropriated these scientific insights to push the idea that genetics can determine who we are socially, none more controversially than the former New York Times science writer Nicholas Wade. In his 2014 book, A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History, Wade argues that genetic differences in human populations manifest in predictable social differences between those groups. His book was strongly denounced by almost all prominent researchers in the field as a shoddy incarnation of race science, but the idea that our DNA can determine who we are in some social sense has also crept into more mainstream perspectives.In an op-ed published in the New York Times last year, the Harvard geneticist David Reich argued that although genetics does not substantiate any racist stereotypes, differences in genetic ancestry do correlate to many of today’s racial constructs. “I have deep sympathy for the concern that genetic discoveries could be misused to justify racism,” he wrote. “But as a geneticist I also know that it is simply no longer possible to ignore average genetic differences among ‘races’.”Reich’s op-ed was shared widely and drew condemnation from other geneticists and social science researchers.In an open letter to Buzzfeed, a group of 67 experts also criticized Reich’s careless communication of his ideas. The signatories worried that imprecise language within such a fraught field of research would make the insights of population genetics more susceptible to being “misunderstood and misinterpreted”, lending scientific validity to racist ideology and ethno-nationalist politics.And indeed, this already appears to be happening. In the United States, white nationalists have channeled the ideals of racial purity into an obsession with the reliability of direct-to-consumer DNA testing. In Greece, the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party regularly draw on studies on the origins of Greek DNA to “prove” 4,000 years of racial continuity and ethnic supremacy.Most concerning is how the conflation of genetics and racial identity is being mobilized politically. In Australia, the far-right One Nation party recently suggested that First Nations people be given DNA tests to “prove” how Indigenous they are before receiving government benefits. In February, the New York Times reported that authorities in China are using DNA testing to determine whether someone is of Uighur ancestry, as part of a broader campaign of surveillance and oppression against the Muslim minority.While DNA testing in Israel is still limited to proving Jewishness in relation to religious life, it comes at a time when the intersections of ethnic, political and religious identity are becoming increasingly blurry. Just last year, Benjamin Netanyahu’s government passed the Nation State law, which codified that the right to national self-determination in the country is “unique to the Jewish people”.Shlomo Sand, an Israeli historian who has written extensively on the politics of Jewish population genetics, worries that if DNA testing is normalized by the Rabbinate, it could be used to confirm citizenship in the future. “Israeli society is becoming more of a closed, ethno-centric society,” he said. “I am worried that people will start to use this genetic testing to build this political national identity.”For Sand, there is a particularly dark irony that this type of genetic discrimination is being weaponized by Jews against other Jews. “I am the descendant of Holocaust survivors, people who suffered because of biological and essentialist attitudes to human groups,” he told me. “When I hear stories of people using DNA to prove that you are a Jew, or French, or Greek, or Finnish, I feel like the Nazis lost the war, but they won the victory of an ideology of essentialist identity through the blood.”But for Seth Farber, the problem with a DNA test for Jewishness runs deeper than politics it contravenes what he believes to be the essence of Jewish identity. There is a specific principle in Jewish law, he told me, that instructs rabbis not to undermine someone’s self-declared religious identity if that person has been accepted by a Jewish community. The central principle is that when it comes to Jewish identity, the most important determinants are social – trust, kinship, commitment – not biological. “Our tradition has always been that if someone lives among us and partakes in communal and religious life, then they are one of us,” Farber said. “Just because we have 23andMe doesn’t mean that we should abandon this. That would be an unwarranted and radical reinterpretation of Jewish law.”As I was reporting this story, it often struck me as oxymoronic that an institution like the Rabbinate would embrace new technology to uphold an ancient identity. It seemed to contradict the very premise of Orthodoxy, which, by definition, is supposed to rigidly maintain tradition in the face of all that is new and unknown.But Jessica Mozersky, assistant professor of medicine at Washington University in St Louis, explained that part of the reason why the Rabbinate might be comfortable with using DNA to confirm Jewishness is because of an existing familiarity with genetic testing in the community to screen for rare genetic conditions. “Because Ashkenazi communities have a history of marrying in, they have this high risk for certain heritable diseases and have established genetic screening programs,” she explained. “So this has made it less fraught and problematic to talk about Jewish genetics in Ashkenazi communities.”In fact, the Orthodox Jewish community is so comfortable with the idea of genetic identity that they have even put together their own international genetic database called Dor Yeshorim, which acts as both a dating service and public health initiative. When two members of the community are being set up for marriage, Mozersky explained, the matchmaker will check whether or not they are genetically compatible on the DNA database. “This means that the notion of genetics as a part of identity is deeply interwoven in many ways with communal life,” she said.This is something I could identify with. When I was 16 and attending a Jewish day-school in Melbourne, Australia, we had what was called “mouth-swab day”. Everyone in my grade gathered on the basketball courts to provide spit samples that were sent off and screened for Tay-Sachs disease, a rare inherited disorder significantly more common among Ashkenazi Jews that eats away at the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. As we waited in line, we joked that this was our punishment for our ancestors marrying their cousins.A few weeks later, after we got the results, I told my grandmother about “mouth-swab day”. I was interested in her thoughts on my newly discovered genetic identity, which seemed to connect me biologically to the world she grew up in, a world of insularity, religiosity, tradition, and trauma.“It’s like I’ve always said,” she declared, after I told her that I wasn’t a carrier of this rare genetic mutation. “It’s important to mix the blood.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5326eba626078cbaa8d00e7734dfed8fe7dbed79/707_1395_790_474/master/790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41e085aef0c607012a2cc8c00ff28e96","title":"the mindfulness conspiracy capitalist spirituality","story":"It is sold as a force that can help us cope with the ravages of capitalism, but with its inward focus, mindful meditation may be the enemy of activism. By  Ronald PurserMindfulness has gone mainstream, with celebrity endorsement from Oprah Winfrey and Goldie Hawn. Meditation coaches, monks and neuroscientists went to Davos to impart the finer points to CEOs attending the World Economic Forum. The founders of the mindfulness movement have grown evangelical. Prophesying that its hybrid of science and meditative discipline “has the potential to ignite a universal or global renaissance”, the inventor of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), Jon Kabat-Zinn, has bigger ambitions than conquering stress. Mindfulness, he proclaims, “may actually be the only promise the species and the planet have for making it through the next couple of hundred years”.So, what exactly is this magic panacea? In 2014, Time magazine put a youthful blonde woman on its cover, blissing out above the words: “The Mindful Revolution.” The accompanying feature described a signature scene from the standardised course teaching MBSR: eating a raisin very slowly. “The ability to focus for a few minutes on a single raisin isn’t silly if the skills it requires are the keys to surviving and succeeding in the 21st century,” the author explained.But anything that offers success in our unjust society without trying to change it is not revolutionary – it just helps people cope. In fact, it could also be making things worse. Instead of encouraging radical action, mindfulness says the causes of suffering are disproportionately inside us, not in the political and economic frameworks that shape how we live. And yet mindfulness zealots believe that paying closer attention to the present moment without passing judgment has the revolutionary power to transform the whole world. It’s magical thinking on steroids.There are certainly worthy dimensions to mindfulness practice. Tuning out mental rumination does help reduce stress, as well as chronic anxiety and many other maladies. Becoming more aware of automatic reactions can make people calmer and potentially kinder. Most of the promoters of mindfulness are nice, and having personally met many of them, including the leaders of the movement, I have no doubt that their hearts are in the right place. But that isn’t the issue here. The problem is the product they’re selling, and how it’s been packaged. Mindfulness is nothing more than basic concentration training. Although derived from Buddhism, it’s been stripped of the teachings on ethics that accompanied it, as well as the liberating aim of dissolving attachment to a false sense of self while enacting compassion for all other beings.What remains is a tool of self-discipline, disguised as self-help. Instead of setting practitioners free, it helps them adjust to the very conditions that caused their problems. A truly revolutionary movement would seek to overturn this dysfunctional system, but mindfulness only serves to reinforce its destructive logic. The neoliberal order has imposed itself by stealth in the past few decades, widening inequality in pursuit of corporate wealth. People are expected to adapt to what this model demands of them. Stress has been pathologised and privatised, and the burden of managing it outsourced to iniduals. Hence the pedlars of mindfulness step in to save the day.But none of this means that mindfulness ought to be banned, or that anyone who finds it useful is deluded. Reducing suffering is a noble aim and it should be encouraged. But to do this effectively, teachers of mindfulness need to acknowledge that personal stress also has societal causes. By failing to address collective suffering, and systemic change that might remove it, they rob mindfulness of its real revolutionary potential, reducing it to something banal that keeps people focused on themselves.The fundamental message of the mindfulness movement is that the underlying cause of dissatisfaction and distress is in our heads. By failing to pay attention to what actually happens in each moment, we get lost in regrets about the past and fears for the future, which make us unhappy. Kabat-Zinn, who is often labelled the father of modern mindfulness, calls this a “thinking disease”. Learning to focus turns down the volume on circular thought, so Kabat-Zinn’s diagnosis is that our “entire society is suffering from attention deficit disorder – big time”. Other sources of cultural malaise are not discussed. The only mention of the word “capitalist” in Kabat-Zinn’s book Coming to Our Senses: Healing Ourselves and the World Through Mindfulness occurs in an anecdote about a stressed investor who says: “We all suffer a kind of ADD.”Mindfulness advocates, perhaps unwittingly, are providing support for the status quo. Rather than discussing how attention is monetised and manipulated by corporations such as Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple, they locate the crisis in our minds. It is not the nature of the capitalist system that is inherently problematic rather, it is the failure of iniduals to be mindful and resilient in a precarious and uncertain economy. Then they sell us solutions that make us contented, mindful capitalists.By practising mindfulness, inidual freedom is supposedly found within “pure awareness”, undistracted by external corrupting influences. All we need to do is close our eyes and watch our breath. And that’s the crux of the supposed revolution: the world is slowly changed, one mindful inidual at a time. This political philosophy is oddly reminiscent of George W Bush’s “compassionate conservatism”. With the retreat to the private sphere, mindfulness becomes a religion of the self. The idea of a public sphere is being eroded, and any trickledown effect of compassion is by chance. As a result, notes the political theorist Wendy Brown, “the body politic ceases to be a body, but is, rather, a group of inidual entrepreneurs and consumers”.Mindfulness, like positive psychology and the broader happiness industry, has depoliticised stress. If we are unhappy about being unemployed, losing our health insurance, and seeing our children incur massive debt through college loans, it is our responsibility to learn to be more mindful. Kabat-Zinn assures us that “happiness is an inside job” that simply requires us to attend to the present moment mindfully and purposely without judgment. Another vocal promoter of meditative practice, the neuroscientist Richard Davidson, contends that “wellbeing is a skill” that can be trained, like working out one’s biceps at the gym. The so-called mindfulness revolution meekly accepts the dictates of the marketplace. Guided by a therapeutic ethos aimed at enhancing the mental and emotional resilience of iniduals, it endorses neoliberal assumptions that everyone is free to choose their responses, manage negative emotions, and “flourish” through various modes of self-care. Framing what they offer in this way, most teachers of mindfulness rule out a curriculum that critically engages with causes of suffering in the structures of power and economic systems of capitalist society.The term “McMindfulness” was coined by Miles Neale, a Buddhist teacher and psychotherapist, who described “a feeding frenzy of spiritual practices that provide immediate nutrition but no long-term sustenance”. The contemporary mindfulness fad is the entrepreneurial equal of McDonald’s. The founder of McDonald’s, Ray Kroc, created the fast food industry. Very early on, when he was selling milkshakes, Kroc spotted the franchising potential of a restaurant chain in San Bernadino, California. He made a deal to serve as the franchising agent for the McDonald brothers. Soon afterwards, he bought them out, and grew the chain into a global empire. Kabat-Zinn, a dedicated meditator, had a vision in the midst of a retreat: he could adapt Buddhist teachings and practices to help hospital patients deal with physical pain, stress and anxiety. His masterstroke was the branding of mindfulness as a secular spirituality.Kroc saw his chance to provide busy Americans with instant access to food that would be delivered consistently through automation, standardisation and discipline. Kabat-Zinn perceived the opportunity to give stressed-out Americans easy access to MBSR through an eight-week mindfulness course for stress reduction that would be taught consistently using a standardised curriculum. MBSR teachers would gain certification by attending programmes at Kabat-Zinn’s Center for Mindfulness in Worcester, Massachusetts. He continued to expand the reach of MBSR by identifying new markets such as corporations, schools, government and the military, and endorsing other forms of “mindfulness-based interventions” (MBIs).Both men took measures to ensure that their products would not vary in quality or content across franchises. Burgers and fries at McDonald’s are the same whether one is eating them in Dubai or in Dubuque. Similarly, there is little variation in the content, structuring and curriculum of MBSR courses around the world.Mindfulness has been oversold and commodified, reduced to a technique for just about any instrumental purpose. It can give inner-city kids a calming time-out, or hedge-fund traders a mental edge, or reduce the stress of military drone pilots. Void of a moral compass or ethical commitments, unmoored from a vision of the social good, the commodification of mindfulness keeps it anchored in the ethos of the market.This has come about partly because proponents of mindfulness believe that the practice is apolitical, and so the avoidance of moral inquiry and the reluctance to consider a vision of the social good are intertwined. It is simply assumed that ethical behaviour will arise “naturally” from practice and the teacher’s “embodiment” of soft-spoken niceness, or through the happenstance of self-discovery. However, the claim that major ethical changes will follow from “paying attention to the present moment, non-judgmentally” is patently flawed. The emphasis on “non-judgmental awareness” can just as easily disable one’s moral intelligence.In Selling Spirituality: The Silent Takeover of Religion, Jeremy Carrette and Richard King argue that traditions of Asian wisdom have been subject to colonisation and commodification since the 18th century, producing a highly inidualistic spirituality, perfectly accommodated to dominant cultural values and requiring no substantive change in lifestyle. Such an inidualistic spirituality is clearly linked with the neoliberal agenda of privatisation, especially when masked by the ambiguous language used in mindfulness. Market forces are already exploiting the momentum of the mindfulness movement, reorienting its goals to a highly circumscribed inidual realm.Mindfulness is easily co-opted and reduced to merely “pacifying feelings of anxiety and disquiet at the inidual level, rather than seeking to challenge the social, political and economic inequalities that cause such distress”, write Carrette and King. But a commitment to this kind of privatised and psychologised mindfulness is political – therapeutically optimising iniduals to make them “mentally fit”, attentive and resilient, so they may keep functioning within the system. Such capitulation seems like the farthest thing from a revolution – more like a quietist surrender.Mindfulness is positioned as a force that can help us cope with the noxious influences of capitalism. But because what it offers is so easily assimilated by the market, its potential for social and political transformation is neutered. Leaders in the mindfulness movement believe that capitalism and spirituality can be reconciled they want to relieve the stress of iniduals without having to look deeper and more broadly at its causes.A truly revolutionary mindfulness would challenge the western sense of entitlement to happiness irrespective of ethical conduct. However, mindfulness programmes do not ask executives to examine how their managerial decisions and corporate policies have institutionalised greed, ill will and delusion. Instead, the practice is being sold to executives as a way to de-stress, improve productivity and focus, and bounce back from working 80-hour weeks. They may well be “meditating”, but it works like taking an aspirin for a headache. Once the pain goes away, it is business as usual. Even if iniduals become nicer people, the corporate agenda of maximising profits does not change.If mindfulness just helps people cope with the toxic conditions that make them stressed in the first place, then perhaps we could aim a bit higher. Should we celebrate the fact that this perversion is helping people to “auto-exploit” themselves? This is the core of the problem. The internalisation of focus for mindfulness practice also leads to other things being internalised, from corporate requirements to structures of dominance in society. Perhaps worst of all, this submissive position is framed as freedom. Indeed, mindfulness thrives on doublespeak about freedom, celebrating self-centered “freedoms” while paying no attention to civic responsibility, or the cultivation of a collective mindfulness that finds genuine freedom within a co-operative and just society.Of course, reductions in stress and increases in personal happiness and wellbeing are much easier to sell than serious questions about injustice, inequity and environmental devastation. The latter involve a challenge to the social order, while the former play directly to mindfulness’s priorities – sharpening people’s focus, improving their performance at work and in exams, and even promising better sex lives. Not only has mindfulness been repackaged as a novel technique of psychotherapy, but its utility is commercially marketed as self-help. This branding reinforces the notion that spiritual practices are indeed an inidual’s private concern. And once privatised, these practices are easily co-opted for social, economic and political control.Rather than being used as a means to awaken iniduals and organisations to the unwholesome roots of greed, ill will and delusion, mindfulness is more often refashioned into a banal, therapeutic, self-help technique that can actually reinforce those roots.Mindfulness is said to be a $4bn industry. More than 60,000 books for sale on Amazon have a variant of “mindfulness” in their title, touting the benefits of Mindful Parenting, Mindful Eating, Mindful Teaching, Mindful Therapy, Mindful Leadership, Mindful Finance, a Mindful Nation, and Mindful Dog Owners, to name just a few. There is also The Mindfulness Colouring Book, part of a bestselling subgenre in itself. Besides books, there are workshops, online courses, glossy magazines, documentary films, smartphone apps, bells, cushions, bracelets, beauty products and other paraphernalia, as well as a lucrative and burgeoning conference circuit. Mindfulness programmes have made their way into schools, Wall Street and Silicon Valley corporations, law firms, and government agencies, including the US military.The presentation of mindfulness as a market-friendly palliative explains its warm reception in popular culture. It slots so neatly into the mindset of the workplace that its only real threat to the status quo is to offer people ways to become more skilful at the rat race. Modern society’s neoliberal consensus argues that those who enjoy power and wealth should be given free rein to accumulate more. It’s perhaps no surprise that those mindfulness merchants who accept market logic are a hit with the CEOs in Davos, where Kabat-Zinn has no qualms about preaching the gospel of competitive advantage from meditative practice.Over the past few decades, neoliberalism has outgrown its conservative roots. It has hijacked public discourse to the extent that even self-professed progressives, such as Kabat-Zinn, think in neoliberal terms. Market values have invaded every corner of human life, defining how most of us are forced to interpret and live in the world.Perhaps the most straightforward definition of neoliberalism comes from the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, who calls it “a programme for destroying collective structures that may impede the pure market logic”. We are generally conditioned to think that a market-based society provides us with ample (if not equal) opportunities for increasing the value of our “human capital” and self-worth. And in order to fully actualise personal freedom and potential, we need to maximise our own welfare, freedom, and happiness by deftly managing internal resources.Since competition is so central, neoliberal ideology holds that all decisions about how society is run should be left to the workings of the marketplace, the most efficient mechanism for allowing competitors to maximise their own good. Other social actors – including the state, voluntary associations, and the like – are just obstacles to the smooth operation of market logic.For an actor in neoliberal society, mindfulness is a skill to be cultivated, or a resource to be put to use. When mastered, it helps you to navigate the capitalist ocean’s tricky currents, keeping your attention “present-centred and non-judgmental” to deal with the inevitable stress and anxiety from competition. Mindfulness helps you to maximise your personal wellbeing.All of this may help you to sleep better at night. But the consequences for society are potentially dire. The Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek has analysed this trend. As he sees it, mindfulness is “establishing itself as the hegemonic ideology of global capitalism”, by helping people “to fully participate in the capitalist dynamic while retaining the appearance of mental sanity”.By deflecting attention from the social structures and material conditions in a capitalist culture, mindfulness is easily co-opted. Celebrity role models bless and endorse it, while Californian companies including Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple and Zynga have embraced it as an adjunct to their brand. Google’s former in-house mindfulness tsar Chade-Meng Tan had the actual job title Jolly Good Fellow. “Search inside yourself,” he counselled colleagues and readers – for there, not in corporate culture – lies the source of your problems.The rhetoric of “self-mastery”, “resilience” and “happiness” assumes wellbeing is simply a matter of developing a skill. Mindfulness cheerleaders are particularly fond of this trope, saying we can train our brains to be happy, like exercising muscles. Happiness, freedom and wellbeing become the products of inidual effort. Such so-called “skills” can be developed without reliance on external factors, relationships or social conditions. Underneath its therapeutic discourse, mindfulness subtly reframes problems as the outcomes of choices. Personal troubles are never attributed to political or socioeconomic conditions, but are always psychological in nature and diagnosed as pathologies. Society therefore needs therapy, not radical change. This is perhaps why mindfulness initiatives have become so attractive to government policymakers. Societal problems rooted in inequality, racism, poverty, addiction and deteriorating mental health can be reframed in terms of inidual psychology, requiring therapeutic help. Vulnerable subjects can even be told to provide this themselves.Neoliberalism ides the world into winners and losers. It accomplishes this task through its ideological linchpin: the inidualisation of all social phenomena. Since the autonomous (and free) inidual is the primary focal point for society, social change is achieved not through political protest, organising and collective action, but via the free market and atomised actions of iniduals. Any effort to change this through collective structures is generally troublesome to the neoliberal order. It is therefore discouraged.An illustrative example is the practice of recycling. The real problem is the mass production of plastics by corporations, and their overuse in retail. However, consumers are led to believe that being personally wasteful is the underlying issue, which can be fixed if they change their habits. As a recent essay in Scientific American scoffs: “Recycling plastic is to saving the Earth what hammering a nail is to halting a falling skyscraper.” Yet the neoliberal doctrine of inidual responsibility has performed its sleight-of-hand, distracting us from the real culprit. This is far from new. In the 1950s, the “Keep America Beautiful” campaign urged iniduals to pick up their trash. The project was bankrolled by corporations such as Coca-Cola, Anheuser-Busch and Phillip Morris, in partnership with the public service announcement Ad Council, which coined the term “litterbug” to shame miscreants. Two decades later, a famous TV ad featured a Native American man weeping at the sight of a motorist dumping garbage. “People Start Pollution. People Can Stop It,” was the slogan. The essay in Scientific American, by Matt Wilkins, sees through such charades.At face value, these efforts seem benevolent, but they obscure the real problem, which is the role that corporate polluters play in the plastic problem. This clever misdirection has led journalist and author Heather Rogers to describe Keep America Beautiful as the first corporate greenwashing front, as it has helped shift the public focus to consumer recycling behaviour and thwarted legislation that would increase extended producer responsibility for waste management.We are repeatedly sold the same message: that inidual action is the only real way to solve social problems, so we should take responsibility. We are trapped in a neoliberal trance by what the education scholar Henry Giroux calls a “disimagination machine”, because it stifles critical and radical thinking. We are admonished to look inward, and to manage ourselves. Disimagination impels us to abandon creative ideas about new possibilities. Instead of seeking to dismantle capitalism, or rein in its excesses, we should accept its demands and use self-discipline to be more effective in the market. To change the world, we are told to work on ourselves — to change our minds by being more mindful, nonjudgmental, and accepting of circumstances.It is a fundamental tenet of neoliberal mindfulness, that the source of people’s problems is found in their heads. This has been accentuated by the pathologising and medicalisation of stress, which then requires a remedy and expert treatment – in the form of mindfulness interventions. The ideological message is that if you cannot alter the circumstances causing distress, you can change your reactions to your circumstances. In some ways, this can be helpful, since many things are not in our control. But to abandon all efforts to fix them seems excessive. Mindfulness practices do not permit critique or debate of what might be unjust, culturally toxic or environmentally destructive. Rather, the mindful imperative to “accept things as they are” while practising “nonjudgmental, present moment awareness” acts as a social anesthesia, preserving the status quo.The mindfulness movement’s promise of “human flourishing” (which is also the rallying cry of positive psychology) is the closest it comes to defining a vision of social change. However, this vision remains inidualised and depends on the personal choice to be more mindful. Mindfulness practitioners may of course have a very different political agenda to that of neoliberalism, but the risk is that they start to retreat into their own private worlds and particular identities — which is just where the neoliberal power structures want them.Mindfulness practice is embedded in what Jennifer Silva calls the “mood economy”. In Coming Up Short: Working-Class Adulthood in an Age of Uncertainty, Silva explains that, like the privatisation of risk, a mood economy makes “iniduals solely responsible for their emotional fates”. In such a political economy of affect, emotions are regulated as a means to enhance one’s “emotional capital”. At Google’s Search Inside Yourself mindfulness programme, emotional intelligence (EI) figures prominently in the curriculum. The programme is marketed to Google engineers as instrumental to their career success — by engaging in mindfulness practice, managing emotions generates surplus economic value, equivalent to the acquisition of capital. The mood economy also demands the ability to bounce back from setbacks to stay productive in a precarious economic context. Like positive psychology, the mindfulness movement has merged with the “science of happiness”. Once packaged in this way, it can be sold as a technique for personal life-hacking optimisation, disembedding iniduals from social worlds.All the promises of mindfulness resonate with what the University of Chicago cultural theorist Lauren Berlant calls “cruel optimism”, a defining neoliberal characteristic. It is cruel in that one makes affective investments in what amount to fantasies. We are told that if we practice mindfulness, and get our inidual lives in order, we can be happy and secure. It is therefore implied that stable employment, home ownership, social mobility, career success and equality will naturally follow. We are also promised that we can gain self-mastery, controlling our minds and emotions so we can thrive and flourish amid the vagaries of capitalism.As Joshua Eisen, the author of Mindful Calculations, puts it: “Like kale, acai berries, gym memberships, vitamin water, and other new year’s resolutions, mindfulness indexes a profound desire to change, but one premised on a fundamental reassertion of neoliberal fantasies of self-control and unfettered agency.” We just have to sit in silence, watching our breath, and wait. It is doubly cruel because these normative fantasies of the “good life” are already crumbling under neoliberalism, and we make it worse if we focus inidually on our feelings. Neglecting shared vulnerabilities and interdependence, we disimagine the collective ways we might protect ourselves. And despite the emptiness of nurturing fantasies, we continue to cling to them.Mindfulness isn’t cruel in and of itself. It’s only cruel when fetishised and attached to inflated promises. It is then, as Berlant points out, that “the object that draws your attachment actively impedes the aim that brought you to it initially”. The cruelty lies in supporting the status quo while using the language of transformation. This is how neoliberal mindfulness promotes an inidualistic vision of human flourishing, enticing us to accept things as they are, mindfully enduring the ravages of capitalism.Adapted from McMindfulness: How Mindfulness Became the New Capitalist Spirituality by Ronald Purser, published by Watkins Media on 9 July and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/220237bf2576dc4b8423ff666116072ffbef963f/0_729_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7eb949f336915160e845069342b35d75","title":"world on mute absolute silence divine state","story":"Lying on my back in a cyan sea, both ears underwater, I felt every problem I had could sink into the sand and bury itselfNot many people have heard of misophonia – which is ironic, because it has everything to do with hearing. It describes extreme reactions – in my case, mostly rage, but in the case of others it may be anxiety or disgust – to certain sounds. I don’t actually know whether I have misophonia. It seems low on the list of conditions I have to worry about, or potentially worry about, but there is no doubt I get disproportionately irritated by certain sounds, all of them human-made.The issue is that while some sounds are inconsiderate (leaking music from headphones, for instance, which I think most people can’t stand), others are socially acceptable. Kids constantly shrieking are just expressing themselves someone can’t help if it if they need to clear their throat repeatedly. The man nonstop clicking his lighter during a bus ride wasn’t harming anyone, but I had to politely and apologetically ask him if he would mind stopping, because otherwise I wasn’t sure I would end the journey with my nerves intact. I have a two-stage strategy with continuous whisperers in the cinema: a dagger stare, then going over and asking them to shut up.It will come as no surprise, then, that I find absolute silence almost a ine state. Lying on my back in a cyan sea recently, both ears underwater, staring up into a sky uninterrupted by clouds, I felt as though every problem I had could sink into the sand and bury itself. It was almost total silence: the world on mute the chatter of Twitter buttoned as it leaves opinionated mouths.I don’t hate all noise. In fact, I have written a column in this magazine about the various sounds of sport, most of which I adore: the swish of nets the squeak of trainers on courts. I hate whispering in the cinema, but I love it on the ASMR playlists I listen to. I enjoy the clack of a keyboard. But being awake during the night, when sound sometimes stops like a needle being lifted from a record player, is stunning.A physicist will say there is no such thing as “absolute” silence. The lowest sound level in the natural world is that of particles moving through gas or liquid, known as Brownian motion. But tech companies have tried to top this, creating sound-sealed rooms known as anechoic chambers. Apparently, spending 45 minutes or so in one will make you go a bit mad – it is that quiet. I would still like to know if there are any in the UK that will let me visit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5dc07ed3939504cf6ec5e9713c2bc25c03a5388/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70ae7c8877262c20fa9ec26abb5da820","title":"park jiha philos review","story":"(Tak:tilGlitterbeat)Using no more than three instruments on each track especially the yanggeum, Jiha’s music expresses as much emotion as words could conveyPark Jiha trained in classical Korean instrumentation and has been a key figure, along with bands such as Jambinai, in firmly pushing forward the lineage of “traditional” Korean music. Where her debut, 2018’s Communion, was a group effort, interweaving traditional Korean instruments – the reed wind piri and gargantuan saenghwang – with saxophone and bass clarinet, Philos is a far more isolated affair.Here, her vision finds its clearest expression – featuring just four instruments, or five if you also count the voice of poet Dima El Sayed reading her piece Easy on a song of the same name. As the album’s sole player, Jiha transcends the sum of her tools’ parts to create a deceptively enveloping soundscape that evolves from soft, ambient warmth and playful melody to brittle, bone-rattling tension – textures so uncannily rendered that they almost sound programmed by computer.The star of the show is the yanggeum, a hammered dulcimer that produces flutters of high-pitched melody while also resonating like a rumbling drone on its bass strings, and the highlights of Philos come where it appears unadorned on tracks such as Thunder Shower. Inspired by a sudden summer downpour, it builds layers of the dulcimer to evoke the intensity of falling rain. Another yanggeum-rooted track, Walker: In Seoul, takes a slower pace, gambolling along to a fairground melody and suggesting the ambience of a city stroll.The beauty of Jiha’s work lies in the spaces she leaves to evoke these imaginative moments in the listener. With the use of no more than three instruments in any one composition, Jiha displays not only her subtle arranging skill but also the capacity for instrumental music to express as much meaning and emotion as language – so much so that the introduction of El Sayed’s poem in her tenor voice is jarring, whereas Jiha’s own non-verbal vocals on the dreamy When I Think of Her keeps the listener within her imagined space. Philos is all the better for its isolation, benefitting from its repetitive minimalism and Jiha’s relentlessly creative approach to playing.Senegalese superstar and one-time politician Youssou N’Dour releases his 39th album, History, showcasing his guitar-led take on mbalax, the pop genre he has made his own.

And he felt just like Jesus’s son.Other MPs had their phones confiscated at the door. There had been rumours that Team Boris, led by Gavin Williamson, had instructed all their supporters to take a picture of their ballot paper with the X in the appropriate box. Trust is currently in short supply in the Tory party, and many MPs appear shell-shocked by the viciousness of the threats being made in private in the Commons tea rooms. More savvy MPs came ready with a burner phone.

Which must be the first time a leadership contender has openly admitted he wouldn’t be voting for himself. Boris Johnson, mouth clamped shut with gaffer tape, arrived with a minder whose sole job was to ensure his man said nothing to anyone. Mission accomplished.

McVey and Leadsom kept their heads down, as if already resigned to their fate, while Stewart paced nervously. It soon became clear why.

She didn’t look best pleased when several journalists, myself included, started sniggering. “It’s true,” she said crossly. “At one point he was in sixth place.” It wasn’t the strongest of sales pitches.As she announced on 24 May, Theresa May will step down formally as Conservative leader on Friday although she will remain in place as prime minister until her successor is chosen.The rules for the contest to replace her have been tweaked by the backbench 1922 Committee, with the backing of the party’s board, in order to prevent the contest dragging on for weeks.Nominations will close at 5.30pm next Monday. Candidates will have to show that they have the support of eight of their colleagues: a proposer, a seconder and six other MPs.MPs will hold a series of votes, in order to narrow down the crowded field, which currently stands at eleven leadership hopefuls.How does the voting work?MPs choose one candidate, in a secret ballot held in a committee room in the House of Commons. The votes are tallied and the results announced on the same day.The 1922 Committee has decided that after the first round, any candidate who wins the support of less than 17 MPs, will be eliminated. And after the second round, the threshold will be set at 33 MPs.Rounds of voting will then continue until just two candidates remain. The first round will be held on Thursday 13 June from 10am to noon. Subsequent rounds have been pencilled in for the 18th, 19th and 20th.The two remaining candidates will then be put to the Conservative membership for a vote.When will the results be announced?Once MPs have whittled down the field to two, Conservative party HQ takes over the running of the next stage, which it says will be completed in the week beginning Monday 22 July.Will there be hustings?Yes: MPs have organised a series of events themselves to put the candidates through their paces, kicking off with an event convened by the One Nation group on Tuesday evening. Conservative party HQ will organise its own events and the BBC has also announced several televised debates between the candidates.Most of the rest took to Twitter to say how delighted they were to have secured so few votes. Mark Harper expressed surprise that anyone knew he existed – it was certainly news to him – while McVey was gobsmacked she had as many as nine backers. As was everyone else. Leadsom counted herself lucky she hadn’t had any new #Rally4Leadsom T-shirts made. Maybe third time lucky. Matt Hancock also couldn’t quite believe he had made such a strong showing with 20 votes. He had been expecting 19 and was so overwhelmed he appeared to be thinking of pulling out. Too much excitement can do that to you.Stewart was punching the air and sounding off to anyone who would listen. And when no one would, he just chatted to his phone. He had made it to the next round and was determined to enjoy every minute of his time in the sun. He tugged heavily on his opium pipe and revealed his alternative visions of the future. And what dreams. He was going to take Boris down. He was the man to beat. Despite finishing a strong seventh. If Boris chose to shut down parliament he would set up his own in Methodist Central Hall across the road. Shame it was already booked. Shame also that he had been so off his head the previous day that he had failed to back a Labour motion that tried to take no deal and prorogation off the table.Elsewhere Boris Johnson prepared for office. Sod Brexit. He hadn’t a clue what to do about that. Besides, there were so many other more important projects to consider first. A bridge to Ireland. A new royal yacht to keep his employers at the  happy. An honours list to die for. The bonfire of the vanities was fully ablaze."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57af62abd60cfe4974f44d748f4a9bc41c1bdba8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1d9a8b3a1102280e292121059f041ab","title":"change uk how not to set up a political party podcast","story":"With six of its 11 MPs having quit, Heather Stewart, the ’s political editor, charts what went wrong.

Another route would be to offer a free day pass to Now TV, Sky’s pay‑as‑you‑go service, as a way of attracting new customers.BT Sport had a huge increase in its audience when placing the Champions League final between Liverpool and Tottenham on its YouTube channel and app free of charge, although it was obliged to do so under the terms of its contract with Uefa given at least one English team was involved.Eoin Morgan is leading a talented and erse team who have risen to the top of the world rankings and are among the World Cup favourites.

Koepka, looking to become the second player in history to win this event for a third time in succession, was already four under par. His remarkable run, which has delivered four major wins in his last eight starts, looked set to continue.Koepka may yet prevail at Pebble Beach but, in a boost to the rest of the field here, Thursday brakes were applied. The 29-year-old played his last 12 holes in two over, meaning an opening round of 69. He is vaguely human, after all.As Koepka wobbled, Justin Rose made hay. The 2013 champion birdied his last three holes en route to a six under par 65. Rose takes a one-stroke lead into day two. His was the joint lowest round at Pebble Beach in a US Open.Rose had been a picture of major consistency until earlier this year, when he missed the cut at the Masters and tied 29th at the US PGA Championship. He appears of a mind to return to the mainstream discussion.Tiger Woods endured an uncharacteristically wayward day with his irons. Woods’s quest for a fourth US Open win began with a 70 which was borderline extraordinary given the erratic nature of his play. But for superb putting, Woods would already be flirting with a missed cut.Rickie Fowler, Xander Schauffle, Louis Oosthuizen and Aaron Wise set the early pace with 66s before Rose gatecrashed the party. Oosthuizen reached that score in the most dramatic fashion, having holed out from a greenside bunker on his final hole.Rory McIlroy’s 68 felt significant on a variety of levels. A day before this championship began, McIlroy publicly bemoaned his series of slow major starts. The Northern Irishman had grown tired of playing catch-up. In 17 of his first rounds since he last won a major, the US PGA Championship of 2014, McIlroy had broken 70 only once until this performance. His frustration over this damaging run was obvious.As he slipped to a bogey five at the 10th, his first, at 8am on a cloudy Californian morning the indications were not good. Instead, McIlroy was to return his best US Open day one score since the 65 which triggered a canter towards glory in 2011. That he enjoyed a similar procession only last weekend at the Canadian Open is also worthy of consideration. McIlroy is not only a man in form but one keen to return to the major-winning territory that was once so common.The 30-year-old understandably made no secret of the value he has placed on flying from the Pebble Beach traps. “It’s important for everybody but especially for me, trying to get my way back to winning these big events,” McIlroy said.“First two majors of this year I shot 73 at Augusta and over par at Bethpage and it’s so hard to chase, especially when courses are so tough. To get off to such a good start, you are right in the tournament from the start which is a nice position to be in. I’m happy with my day’s work.”McIlroy’s putting was impressive, as much to save pars as secure his four birdies. Trouble had threatened on the par three fifth, where a miscued a chip from thick rough. The four-times major winner duly holed out from off the green. At the 218-yard 17th, McIlroy delivered one of the shots of the day to 9ft, from whence a birdie followed.Fowler remains keen to shake off the tag of being the finest player of his golfing generation never to win a major. The Californian signed for a opening-day 66, which represents his second best US Open start. The highlight of Fowler’s matching nines of 33 was a two at the iconic seventh. He found 15 greens in regulation.“I felt like that was as bad as I could have shot, I had more chances out there,” said Fowler. “It’s great when you can have a stress-free 66. I feel great this week, I’m very comfortable here. It has been a few years since I have been here but I’ve played well at Pebble before.“You don’t have to do anything special in majors. It’s just being disciplined and executing the shot that’s at hand.”Graeme McDowell, who had Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson for company on Thursday, carded a bogey-free 69 at the venue where he claimed the US Open of 2010. “I didn’t want to be coming in here, looking round and reminiscing,” McDowell said. “I wanted to come here and compete.”Tyrrell Hatton reached four under with back-to-back birdies from the 14th. Three bogeys in a row followed, meaning Hatton had to settle for a 70. Given the Englishman’s propensity for volcanic eruptions, he was probably best avoided thereafter. Not so Rory Sabbatini, whose hole-in-one at the 12th – the ball seemed otherwise bound for the Pacific Ocean – was the first by a Slovakian in a major. Well, you have to assume so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d49791aa3d3449dffa3037081cbbd4bce73539f5/0_117_2275_1365/master/2275.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f62f2585d58a4bcc8ad6a61dc1f48f15","title":"toronto raptors ","story":"In front of a hostile Oracle Arena crowd that stood on their feet screaming from wire to wire, the Toronto Raptors made history.The NBA’s lone Canadian team won the first NBA championship in their 24-year history, beating the Golden State Warriors, 114-110, in Game 6 of the finals on Thursday night.The game ended in thrilling fashion. With 9.6 seconds left and the Raptors up by one, 111-110, the Raptors committed a costly turnover after Danny Green threw an errant pass to Pascal Siakam. The Warriors had a chance to win when Stephen Curry attempted a three-pointer over three defenders with 0.9 seconds left, but the ball rolled out of the rim.In a mad scramble for possession near center court, Draymond Green attempted to call a timeout, but the Warriors didn’t have any remaining and were assessed a technical foul. The Raptors went on to make the free throw they were awarded, and two more after Kawhi Leonard was fouled just before the buzzer.The victory wasn’t just historic. It was highly impressive given the raucous crowd in Oakland that was both trying to keep their team’s dynasty alive and honoring the Warriors’ final game ever at Oracle Arena.The Raptors went 3-0 on the Warriors’ home court in the finals, capturing the city’s first major sports championship since the Toronto Blue Jays won a second straight World Series 26 years ago.The game had its fair share of drama, including 18 lead changes. It also had its share of heartbreak. The Warriors, who were playing without Kevin Durant after he sustained a ruptured achilles tendon in Game 5, also went on to also lose Klay Thompson to injury.It happened with 2:22 left in the third quarter, after Thompson was fouled hard on a dunk and fell to the floor writhing in pain, clutching his left leg. He was walked to the locker room by Jordan Bell and Jonas Jerebko. A breathless few seconds later, Thompson limped back onto the court as a shocked Oracle Arena roared at his showing of heart.Thompson went on to make two free throws. (If he hadn’t taken those free throws, he wouldn’t have been allowed to return.) Shortly thereafter, he was ruled out for the rest of the game. He finished with a game-high 30 points on 8-for-12 shooting, including four of six three-point shots, in 32 minutes.It was a complete team effort for the Raptors. Kyle Lowry opened the game with 11 points on 4-for-4 shooting, including making all three of his three-pointers. In the first two minutes of the game, he scored more than he did in Game 5 (10 points on 3-for-12 shooting). He finished with a 26 points, seven rebounds and 10 assists.Pascal Siakam continues his season-long emergence into a star with a 26-point performance on 10-for-17 shooting and 10 rebounds on the biggest of basketball stages, making it hard to believe that he burst from obscurity just a short time ago.And Kawhi Leonard, who carried the Raptors on his back throughout the playoffs, had a relatively quiet performance, finishing with 19 points on seven-for-12 shooting, six rebounds and three assists – though he was named NBA finals Most Valuable Player.The Raptors opened the game strong, taking a quick 8-0 lead. Curry, who finished with 21 points, didn’t attempt a field goal until there was 1:25 left in the first quarter. Of course, when he finally took a shot he did it in dramatic fashion, swishing a highly contest long-range three-pointer.The Warriors got their first lead of the game when Draymond Green made a 20-footer, to put them up, 27-26, with 2:16 left in the first quarter. From there it was nip and tuck until the death.Draymond Green had a triple-double with 11 points, 19 rebounds and 13 assists. Two of those assists came off of dunks from Andre Iguodala, who had 22 points on nine-for-15 shooting.Thursday marked the Warriors’ final game at Oracle Arena after a 47-year run.The crowd at Oracle Arena was loud, feverish -- and very vocal. When Thompson shot free throws, they chanted “Game 6 Klay.” After a video tribute to Durant, they chanted “KD, KD.” When Curry shot free throws, they yelled “M-V-P! M-V-P!” And when Curry signaled for them to make noise, they roared.But none of it mattered.It was the Raptors’ night, and they had to earn it every second of the way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57bca5bb6c0153fa708d2818428c739fb552fade/0_0_1050_630/master/1050.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7db68727fb1e040ef7f9c3dd5469f70","title":"edinburgh festival 2019 50 theatre comedy and dance shows to see","story":"There’s a Belle and Sebastian play, a show in a hair salon, Frances Barber performing Pet Shop Boys songs and top comics including Josie Long and Stephen Fry.

Complete with office-chair choreography and a live soundscape by Yas Clarke, it is a satire of the cliches and catchphrases of modern communication.Hair of the WildC at SESH Hairdressing Spanish artist Concha Vidal believes you can learn a lot about someone from their hair. What we have (or do not have) on our heads tells the world about our gender, class and even our mental health. Performing in a real salon, Vidal digs out some wigs and speculates about their owners.La Reprise. Histoire(s) du Théâtre (I)Royal Lyceum Milo Rau is one of the hottest directors on the European theatre scene, although his work has been relatively little seen in the UK. A chance to catch up now with his meditation on violence, both real and theatrical, and an evocation of the homophobic murder of Ihsane Jarfi, a 32-year-old Belgian man, in 2012.All of Me Summerhall A few years ago, performer Caroline Horton stirred some debate about the appropriateness of using a jokey format to discuss anorexia. She was speaking from experience, however, and behind the send up of a micromanaging persona, Mess was a touching insight into an eating disorder. In All of Me, she is on similarly fraught ground as she uses a backstage metaphor to consider the urge to live and to die.Cardboard Citizens: BystandersSummerhall As homelessness grows more visible on our streets, the humanising message of Cardboard Citizens is all the more urgent. After winning acclaim for its adaptation of Cathy Come Home a couple of years ago, the company returns with a compendium of true-life stories from homeless people, ranging from a Polish migrant to a Windrush-generation boxer.Arthur Your home Quite a few family units are doing shows on the fringe, including this by Daniel Bye, who is joined by his infant son, Arthur, under the direction of his wife, Sarah Punshon. To see the show, which picks apart the nature-nurture debate, you have to book it for your own living room.How Not to DrownTraverse Playwright Nicola McCartney joins forces with Dritan Kastrati to dramatise his experience firstly as a refugee from Kosovo and secondly as a child in the UK care system.

Suitable for children and adults, it’s inspired by Scottish folk music and tells the tale of a lonely island where a mysterious stranger is washed up.NarcolepsySummerhall Theatremaker Chris Goode has a 25-year record on the fringe, so it’s an appropriate time for him to look back to his formative days. Reflecting on gay life in the 1990s, he focuses on the late River Phoenix, in a show that is one part documentary, one part “fractured autobiography”.Purposeless MovementsThe Studio Robert Softley Gale’s stock is high after the runaway success of the subversive My LeftRight Foot – The Musical, which he wrote and directed. Here, working with his Birds of Paradise company, he creates a dance-theatre piece focusing on the “purposeless movements” of four men, like him, with cerebral palsy.The Last of the Pelican DaughtersPleasance Courtyard Developed by Complicite, this show by the Wardrobe Ensemble is about four sisters coming to terms with the loss of their mother. A comedy about inheritance, loss and justice, it looks at the way people can exert a hold on us even after they’re gone. From the creators of Education, Education, Education.Pathetic FallacyCanadaHub @ King’s Hall It’s all very well talking the environmental talk, but if you’re burning up the planet in the process, you could be part of the problem. Step forward Anita Rochon, who appears in her own green-themed show only by remote video while a local stand-in takes her place in the lead role.Rich Kids: A History of Shopping Malls in TehranTraverse Javaad Alipoor scored a fringe hit with The Believers Are But Brothers, an interactive play about radicalisation and misinformation, which is returning for a lap of honour at Assembly George Square Studios. Meanwhile, the writer and director looks at the growing disparity in wealth between the rich and poor in Rich Kids, a play about entitlement, consumption and digital technology.Total Immediate Collective Imminent Terrestrial SalvationThe Studio Actor and playwright Tim Crouch joins forces with the National Theatre of Scotland for a piece of apocalyptic meta-theatre.

Step forward Stephen Fry, bringing the stage version of his Greek legends book Mythos to the EIF as the opening dates of a UK tour – his first since hitting the road with Hugh Laurie four decades ago.Sophie DukerPleasance Courtyard Full fringe debut for the much-touted “sexy-cerebral comedy underdog” Duker, of C4’s Riot Girls and club night Wacky Racists. Her show Venus is described as “an unconventional journey of woke self-discovery”, addressing her daddy issues, hatred of Yorkshire puddings and penchant for sexy racists.Nick HelmPleasance Dome The last time he brought a new show to the fringe, Nick Helm’s One-Man Mega Myth was nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy award in 2013. Six years on, the star of Uncle returns with another fragileaggressive nugget of hoarse, heavy-metal comedy.Catherine CohenPleasance Courtyard Known for her weekly cabaret at Alan Cumming’s Manhattan club, the 27-year-old alt-comedy darling specialises in self-mocking jokes and songs about dating in NYC. This is her Edinburgh debut.Kieran HodgsonPleasance Courtyard A treat for completist comedy fans, as multiple Edinburgh Comedy award nominee Hodgson revives his four hit solo shows – from the cute French Exchange to last year’s big-hitting Brexit pre-history ’75 – in rep throughout the second half of the festival. If you only see one: 2015’s Lance is a cracker.Desiree BurchHeroes @ The Hive Desiree’s Coming Early! runs the title of her new show – ironically, given she’s a year late for this engagement with fringe audiences, having had to cancel her 2018 run. The wait is likely to have been worth it for fans of the New Yorker’s unflinching and energetic comedy – as seen on Frankie Boyle’s New World Order and beyond.Simon MunneryThe Stand A little slice of comedy history here, as perennial fringe maverick Simon Munnery does a very un-Munnery thing, and revives his hit character from yesteryear Alan Parker: Urban Warrior. However will this “Wolfie Smith of the 90s” cope with the blasted political landscape of 2019? We’ll soon find out.John RobinsPleasance Courtyard You’d forgive John Robins for feeling overlooked. Coverage of his break-out 2017 breakup show focused as much on his ex, Sara Pascoe, as himself. Then the show with which it shared the Edinburgh Comedy award – Hannah Gadsby’s Nanette – became a global phenomenon. Happily, no one is better than Robins at turning mortification and inadequacy into blistering comedy – as Hot Shame may demonstrate.Jonny and the BaptistsAssembly Roxy What do you do when you’ve been making “musical-activist” lefty comedy for a decade, and the country’s come to this? Pretend everything is just fine, according to Jonny Donahoe and Paddy Gervers, whose new show aims (it claims) to heal a ided world. Elsewhere in Edinburgh, Donahoe premieres his first solo theatre show since the global hit Every Brilliant Thing.Phil WangPleasance Courtyard The title of Phil Wang’s new one, Philly Philly Wang Wang – hot on the heels of recent Radio 4 vehicle Wangsplaining – may not suggest sophistication. But judging by its rave reviews in Melbourne this spring, and the high quality of 2017 predecessor Kinabalu, a clever, contemplative and very funny show seems a certainty.Eddie IzzardAssembly George Square Who knows what to expect from the standup turned actor turned activist, pitching up in Edinburgh – where he was nominated for the Perrier award 28 years ago – with a work-in-progress reading, of all things, of Dickens’ Great Expectations. It sounds like the quintessential fringe ticket.Phoebe RobinsonAssembly George Square NYC comic and actor Robinson, best known for her hit 2 Dope Queens and Sooo Many White Guys podcasts, makes her UK standup debut. As per the title of her bestseller Everything’s Trash, But It’s OK, the show – called Sorry, Harriet Tubman – celebrates pop culture and analyses her failure to live up the black female icons of yesteryear.Josie LongThe Stand There are Edinburgh mainstays and then there’s Josie Long, indie comedy goddess, activist, film-maker – and now a mum, which is the subject of her new show. Like much of Long’s work, Tender will thrum with the tension between Long’s sunny disposition and the despair of being a progressive in grimly regressive times.Zoë Coombs MarrMonkey Barrel A Barry award-winner (and Edinburgh nominee) as her sexist standup alter ego, Dave, then talk of the fringe in critique-the-critics theatre event Wild Bore, Coombs Marr steps out from behind the gimmicks (she claims) in this UK debut of 2018 show Bossy Bottom.

(I have a list to hand, running from close family members, through personal nemeses, on to anyone mounting a leadership challenge and ending with all homeopaths.) It was the rather more sobering consideration of who, out of the 700,000 people from outside the EU who apply to remain here every year, the Home Office – operating via a network of rules and regulations so byzantine and in such constant flux that experts in the field describe themselves as “unsure of the law on any given day” – deems fit to stay.The opening episode (the first of three) focused on four representatives of the main routes in. Valeriya, a 27-year-old Russian on her fifth student visa, has been given £200,000 from her father (“We are millionaires, not billionaires”) to start her own fashion business in order to qualify for an entrepreneur’s visa. Thirty-year-old Rashed developed Crohn’s disease while he was here as a student and has now outstayed his visa by five years while being treated on the NHS (for free, although this is technically in contravention of current rules). He has been refused leave to stay and is appealing on humanitarian grounds, because if he returns to his native Bangladesh he will not be able to access the treatments that keep him alive. Dillian, from Trinidad and Tobago, has already been shot once because of his status as a known gay man and is applying for asylum here. Ajmal is Scottish and applying for work visas for three Indian chefs who have the expertise he needs to expand his high-end restaurant and takeaway business.The frustrations are legion. If, as the CEO of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants Satbir Singh notes, the question of who is allowed in, is as often as not, an economic one, why is Ajmal hamstrung in his efforts to recruit three people who would, in effect, create more than 50 local jobs? He has tried for three years to find people with the requisite skills within the UK, but is barred from looking elsewhere because, although chefs are on the list of workers of whom we have a recognised shortage, anyone having anything to do with takeaway food is not. “Current legislation is … restrictive sometimes to the point of absurdity,” says his lawyer delicately. “All I’m looking for,” says Ajmal, speaking for anyone dealing with bureaucracy, “is a basic measure of common sense.”Sometimes it is the clients who make life difficult for themselves. Valeriya can’t put a workable business plan together and Dillian (“A bit of a Walter Mitty character,” his lawyer says wearily) can’t stop overcomplicating his life story and distracting from the fact of his shooting and assured persecution if he is sent home.But whatever the apparent factors in these decisions, the programme’s weaving together of personal stories and expert commentary gradually shows the more intangible mechanisms at work. Access to the UK depends on a strange brew of political expediency (who is the government pandering to and when) racism (in all its myriad and subtle hues, staining every layer of society and the institutions guarding and shaping it) economic considerations (including the duty to protect finite resources against chancers, so that they are there for the people who fund them) and human compassion. The brew’s toxicity rises and falls according to which elements are in the ascendant. At the same time, the show made points rarely heard in mainstream discussions of immigration. Barrister Colin Yeo noted that the dominant narrative is of immigrants gobbling up an unfair share of some notional national pie, when what they actually do is increase the size of the pie itself. Others pointed out that there is no equivalent to the presumption of innocence in immigration law each case stands on its own merits and is subject to laws so complex that how they are applied often looks like no more than whim.Among the subjects here, justice appeared to be largely done in the end. Rashed and Dillian are staying. The Migration Advisory Committee showed a small measure of common sense and advised removal of the takeaway restriction. And Valeriya is waiting to hear if the Home Office reckons the UK needs another fledgling fashion business from someone with a lot of clothes but no plan. Rashed has had further surgery since filming, which suggests a death sentence was indeed averted. Sip your brew and wonder what it cost to save him, or what it would have cost us to send him back to die."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d52cc4d011df6bd8137c9bdaaab5c40d0f0dcaaf/0_110_2705_1623/master/2705.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15d9e387e293456cc173ca78fcfde82f","title":"new york vaccines measles religion","story":" State lawmakers vote to repeal exemption amid country’s worst measles outbreak in decadesNew York eliminated the religious exemption to vaccine requirements for schoolchildren Thursday, as the country’s worst measles outbreak in decades prompts states to reconsider giving parents ways to opt out of immunization rules.The Democratic-led state senate and assembly voted Thursday to repeal the exemption, which allows parents to cite religious beliefs to forego getting their child the vaccines required for school enrollment.Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed the measure minutes after the final vote. The law takes effect immediately but will give unvaccinated students up to 30 days after they enter a school to show they’ve had the first dose of each required immunization.After New York’s move, similar exemptions are still allowed in 45 states, though lawmakers in several of them have introduced their own legislation to eliminate the waiver.The issue is hotly contested and debate around it has often been emotional, pitting cries that religious freedom is being curtailed against warnings that public health is being endangered. After the vote in the assembly, many of those watching from the gallery erupted in cries of “shame!” One woman yelled obscenities down to the lawmakers below.The debate has only intensified with this year’s measles outbreak, which federal officials recently said has surpassed 1,000 illnesses, the highest in 27 years.“I’m not aware of anything in the Torah, the Bible, the Koran or anything else that suggests you should not get vaccinated,” said the Bronx Democrat Jeffrey Dinowitz, the bill’s assembly sponsor. “If you choose to not vaccinate your child, therefore potentially endangering other children ... then you’re the one choosing not to send your children to school.”Hundreds of parents of unvaccinated children gathered at New York’s Capitol to protest against the vote.Stan Yung, a Long Island attorney and father, said his Russian Orthodox religious views and health concerns about vaccines would prevent him from vaccinating his three young children. His family, he said, might consider leaving the state.“People came to this country to get away from exactly this kind of stuff,” Yung said ahead of Thursday’s votes.Supporters of the bill say religious beliefs about vaccines shouldn’t eclipse scientific evidence that they work, noting that the US supreme court ruled in 1905 that states have the right to enforce compulsory vaccination laws. During the assembly’s floor debate, supporters brought up scourges of the past that were defeated in the US through vaccines.“I’m old enough to have been around when polio was a real threat,” said the assemblywoman Deborah Glick of Manhattan. “I believe in science ... Your personal opinions, which may be based on junk science, do not trump the greater good.”Supporters also suggest some parents may be claiming the religious exemption for their children even though their opposition is actually based on scientifically discredited claims about the dangers of vaccines.The bill would not change an existing state exemption given to children who cannot have vaccines for medical reasons, such as a weakened immune system.Cuomo told reporters on Wednesday that he believed public health – and the need to protect those who cannot get vaccinated for medical reasons – outweighed the concerns about religious freedom.“I understand freedom of religion,” he said. “I have heard the anti-vaxxers’ theory, but I believe both are overwhelmed by the public health risk.”The current measles outbreak has renewed concern about the exemptions in many states. The nation last saw as many cases in 1992, when more than 2,200 were reported.The majority of cases are from outbreaks in New York in Orthodox Jewish communities.California removed personal belief vaccine exemptions for children in both public and private schools in 2015, after a measles outbreak at Disneyland sickened 147 people and spread across the US and into Canada. Maine ended its religious exemption this year.Mississippi and West Virginia also do not allow religious exemptions.Once common in the US, measles became rare after vaccination campaigns that started in the 1960s. A decade ago, there were fewer than 100 cases a year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c32f6f444b25c3662a014d888ccd80950e84a1b/0_91_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09ecbb342c3028cd56a2451f962b875b","title":"argentinian ex army officer accused of found on holiday in sicily","story":"Reporters discovered Carlos Luis Malatto, accused of five counts of crimes against humanity, in MessinaHuman rights groups have expressed outrage after a former Argentinian army officer accused of committing murder and forced disappearances during the 1976-83 military dictatorship was found enjoying a beach holiday in Sicily.Reporters from la Repubblica discovered Lt Colonel Carlos Luis Malatto in a tourist village in the province of Messina, even though he is currently on trial in Rome for crimes committed in Argentina, which is also seeking his extradition.A video posted on the newspaper’s website shows Malatto refusing to answer questions when he was confronted by reporters.Prosecutors in Argentina have offered a 500,000 peso (£10,000) reward for the capture of Malatto, who is accused of five counts of crimes against humanity.Writing to the court of appeal in the Argentinian state of Mendoza, prosecutors alleged that Malatto “actively participated in various detention procedures and is one of the most infamous perpetrators” of the dictatorship “for his participation in interrogations under torture”.Malatto fled Argentina and arrived in Italy in 2011, but in 2014 Rome refused Argentina’s request to extradite him. The following year, Italy’s justice ministry approved his trial in Rome for the murders of Marie Anne Erize, a French-Argentinian model Juan Carlos Cámpora, the rector of the University of San Juan Angel José Alberto Carvajal, a communist party official, and Jorge Bonil, a soldier.However Italian judges refused to put him under house arrest, leaving him free to travel – and take beach holidays.“We asked the Italian judiciary to at least monitor Malatto’s movements, said Jorge Ithurburu, attorney for the Rome-based non-governmental organisation 24 Marzo. “We fear that Malatto may escape justice. It is sad that Italy is still today a refuge for torturers.’’After the 1976 coup, Argentina’s military set about systematically crushing any potential opposition, and eventually murdered some 30,000 people – almost all of them unarmed non-combatants. Pregnant prisoners were kept alive just until they gave birth some 500 babies are believed to have been given to childless military couples to raise as their own.In 1985, barely two years after the country returned to democracy, coup leader Jorge Videla was convicted of human rights abuses and crimes against humanity.Since then, more than 1,000 other former officers have been sentenced for the torture and extrajudicial murder of activists and political opponents and their families.But many former officers continue to live in hiding in Europe, especially in Italy where many Argentinians have family ties. Malatto’s family originally hailed from Abruzzo and he holds an Italian passport.Meanwhile, relatives of the military junta’s victims are still fighting for justice: on Thursday the human rights organisation Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo announced that they had identified the 130th victim who was taken from his mother during the dictatorship.The group said that Javier Matías Darroux Mijalchukis was a four-month old baby when he was kidnapped with his mother Elena Mijalchuk, days after his father Juan Manuel Darroux vanished. Both parents were forcibly disappeared.Next month, a court in Rome is due to give the final verdict in the trial of 24 men for their involvement in Operation Condor, a secret programme in which the dictatorships of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Chile, Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador conspired to kidnap and assassinate opponents in each other’s territories.The trial focused on the disappearance of 23 Italian nationals during the 70s and 80s.But activists warn that many of the perpetrators are growing old and may never be brought to justice. “We must act quickly,” said Ithurburu, “because the more time passes the more the witnesses of those atrocious crimes age or die’’."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b11357617134ec03d977cfad795c80256eb9448e/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98ef8bd9bfe47c4a12746d713ee46d0c","title":"frozen wolfs head found in siberia is 40000 years old","story":"Fur, teeth and tissue largely intact on remains of animal bigger than a modern wolfThe severed head of a wolf that died about 40,000 years ago has been found in Siberia, and because of the freezing conditions, the remains are so well preserved that the fur, teeth, brain and facial tissue are largely intact.Pavel Yefimov, a local resident, discovered the head last summer on the banks of the Tirekhtyakh river close to the Arctic Circle in the region of Yakutia, according to the Siberian Times.The head was handed to the Science Academy of Yakutia.

File photograph: GettyMinister for Education Joe McHugh has pledged to tackle barriers preventing emigrant teachers returning home but has warned he does not have “any quick-fix ideas”.Mr McHugh is due to visit the United Arab Emirates this week to host a series of town hall-style meetings with teachers. The initiative is part of a drive to make it easier for them to return to Ireland.School management bodies say a shortage of teachers is causing a “crisis” due to a lack of substitute cover at primary level and qualified teachers in key subjects at second level.Speaking in advance of his visit, Mr McHugh said he wants to identify practical steps that could make it easier for teachers to return home.A key area he says he will examine is providing a mechanism to recognise teachers’ middle-management experience in schools abroad. Many emigrant teachers express frustration that, despite serving as heads of department, this experience is often not recognised here.“We have to look at the progression of teachers, what new skills, what experience they build up in terms of responsibility,” said Mr McHugh. “We have to open up a wider conversation over the roles of responsibility teachers have abroad and how we incorporate that into the system when they return home. I don’t have any quick-fix ideas around it . . . but those teachers bring experience, talent, insight and new perspectives.”Among the obstacles regularly cited by emigrant teachers include difficulties securing full-time posts at home, red-tape involving the Teaching Council as well as the cost of living.Online portalMr McHugh said a representative from the council will join him for the visit to take on board any ideas for streamlining registration or other issues. He said a new online portal, which opened last week, is an example of the kind of practical steps that would assist emigrant teachers.The portal – which operates under the title turasabhaile or “journey home” – will give teachers the opportunity to register their contact details, CVs, preferred employment location and specialist subjects.Mr McHugh, a former teacher who spent a year teaching in the UAE in the mid-1990s, said the visit also aimed to pay tribute to the contribution of Irish teachers abroad. He said teachers were magnificent ambassadors for the State and were boosting the country’s reputation wherever they go.There are an estimated 2,000 Irish-qualified teachers based in the UAE and hundreds have signed up for three meetings with the Minister in Abu Dhabi, El Ain and Dubai.When asked if the Government would consider additional pay for teachers based in the greater Dublin area – which faces some of the most acute shortages – Mr McHugh replied that the cost of living was also an issue for other professions.He is primarily concerned with looking at the kind of practical steps that can be taken in the short to medium term."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3925073.1560453268!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1il reviewing slate of general election candidates","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin: Told his senior TDs that the results in the elections would dictate the shape of candidate selection strategy. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has told his front bench the party would be taking a fresh look at general election candidates in light of local and European election results.Like most other parties, Fianna Fáil selected its slate of candidates for the general election at an early stage in the expectation that the Government would not last beyond the three years of the confidence and supply agreement.At the front-bench meeting on Tuesday Mr Martin told his senior TDs that the results in the elections would dictate the shape of candidate selection strategy as the party finalises its line-up for the general election. That could lead to candidates being added in some constituencies.The case of Malcolm Byrne has been instanced by many Fianna Fáil TDs. Mr Byrne, a councillor from Gorey, is not a general election candidate. The two chosen in the five-seat Wexford constituency are sitting TD James Browne and Wexford-based Lisa McDonald.However, Mr Byrne’s strong showing in the European parliamentary elections now puts him in the position of front runner to be his party’s candidate in the byelection for the seat vacated by Mick Wallace. If he is chosen, there is a likelihood he could be added to the party ticket for the general election.Party sources said on Thursday there is an outside chance Fianna Fáil could take three seats in Wexford in a general election, where it held a dominant position at time before its fortunes declined in 2011. In areas where the party has two candidates selected, and little prospect of a third seat, the general election ticket will remain unaffected. Such is the case in Dublin Fingal where Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee is likely to be the byelection candidate.There are only three constituencies where Fianna Fáil has yet to hold a selection convention. They are: Cork North Central, Galway West and Dublin Rathdown.Best performersNewly elected MEP Billy Kelleher was the Fianna Fáil TD for Cork North Central so there is no candidate selected there. The best performers in the local elections were Kenneth O’Flynn and Tom Fitzgerald.Several party activists have privately mentioned Séamus McGrath, a brother of finance spokesman Michael McGrath, as a possible candidate for the byelection. He polled the highest number of first preferences in the country, with 4,247 in Carrigaline, in the neighbouring constituency of Cork South Central. Senior party sources have said there is no prospect of him moving constituency to stand in a byelection.In Galway West, the party has yet to select running mates for Éamon Ó Cuív. The party has no TD in Dublin Rathdown. Justin McAleese was seen as a possible candidate but withdrew his interest last year.The party’s former press director, Olivia Buckley, stood in the local elections but narrowly missed out on winning a seat. Former candidate Shay Brennan retained his council seat and is seen by some in the constituency as the front runner."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Man (29) accused of killing 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in MarchAnalysis: Using heavy-handed tactics already utilised in China will make a bad situation much worseLegislature remains closed amid protests over controversial extradition BillMarijuana residue located in incense burners apparently used in funerary rites in 500BCSharing food and water, opponents of extradition Bill say they don\u0026rsquot trust ChinaRunning battles after tens of thousands demonstrate peacefully against proposed extradition lawFierce oppositon to government plan that would allow extradition to mainland ChinaWall Street Journal says source describes \u0026lsquonexus\u0026rsquo between Kim and US intelligence agencyLeader Carrie Lam defends extradition Bill that critics say will empower BeijingPolice arrest hundreds protesting against election as OSCE cites voting irregularitiesGirl (8) in Indian-controlled Kashmir was raped, kept sedated and then bludgeoned to deathBuilder \u0026lsquodownplayed occupants\u0026rsquo concerns\u0026rsquo about fire risk following breaches at other sitesFinancial hub plunged into political crisis after huge protest against lawVladimir Putin says relationship with China at \u0026lsquoan unprecedentedly high level\u0026rsquoVigil to commemorate Tiananmen crackdown and protest against extradition BillDoubts as to fairness surround polls to select Nazarbayev\u0026rsquos successor in central Asian stateCountries accuse one another of dangerous and unprofessional behaviourNearly 1.2 million Japanese identify as \u0026lsquohikikomori\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash people who rarely engage with outside worldPutin and Xi bond evolving as trade issues with US are common to both economiesPolice raids on media are result of highly restrictive and intimidating laws, experts say"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3924439.1560418877!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tory leadership candidates the opium user the buffoon and the swivel eyed loon","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA combination of file pictures  shows the 10 declared contenders in the Conservative Party leadership contest.

Photograph: STFAFPGetty ImagesNext door in Britain there’s a fevered contest under way for leadership of the Tory Party and thus Britain. The right-wing Tory Party once presented itself as the pragmatic party of business. Now it’s a radical separatist sect populated by clownish demagogues.Whoever wins this contest has to appeal to the 120,000 older little Englanders with Tory party membership who wistfully recall the days of village fetes and bowling on the green and tea with vicar and asbestos in the walls and child labour in the chimneys and unrest in the colonies and the gold standard and TB.And here are the 10 people who promised to make them happy. Thursday’s vote saw three of them eliminated.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEnvironment Secretary Michael GoveWatch him hereA haunted-ventriloquist’s dummy who betrayed and renounced Boris Johnson in the last leadership contest, Gove is here to remind us how wonderful Brexit will be with his treacherous wooden hand on the tiller. He was a journalist once, which means, of course, that he is very talented.In his campaign video, cameras zoom around his pouting Pob-like lips as he speaks slowly about wanting everyone to be “author of their life story” although, typical Tory, he doesn’t go into details on the royalty split.There are also pictures of Britain to remind us where he lives, and pictures of Jeremy Corbyn to remind Tories of what they fear, and some footage of a man holding his little son’s hand to remind us that that though Gove is not of our flesh he understands human emotions and aspires to be one of us. Well, at least until Geppetto tracks him down and drags him back to his workshop. If I was on his campaign team I’d try the slogan “a velvet Gove cast in iron.”A serial leadership candidate and one of the Leave-campaign generals who fronted the Brexit attack on the nation’s economy, Leadsom has in the past said that Brexit sceptics are unpatriotic, has exaggerated her financial industry background and has claimed that those without children have no stake in the future.The latter breaks down as an argument when you look at all the parents who are doing their best to turn their children’s futures into dystopian hellscapes. Ah, feck it I’m a newspaper journalist and I need to be even-handed. One woman’s dystopian hellscape is another’s free-trade Utopia, after all.Rory Stewart is an elderly child and former opium user and the breakout star of this election cycle. He recently posted a video on Twitter in which, despite it clearly being on a tripod, he pretended to be holding his camera selfie-style.But seriously, what do people expect from him, a working knowledge of social media mores? His illicit substance of choice was OPIUM, for God’s sake. That’s the pharmacological equivalent of the Imperial System or cucumber sandwiches with the Queen.Any true Conservative should be encouraging their children to smoke opium. Indeed, in normal times Stewart would be the sort of reasonable compromising conservative who wins contests like this. However, as you’ll know from the scythe-wielding horsemen that rode by your window these are not normal times.Former foreign secretary Boris JohnsonWatch him hereWith Michael Gove admitted to having taken cocaine in the 1990s and Rory Stewart admitted to having taken opium in his youth, it probably took all of Boris’s willpower not to yell, “And I’m off my head on ketamine right now!”He truly is an attention-seeking buffoon, the type of hesitating, self-deprecating Englishman who charms Americans and populates Richard Curtis films and who will not hesitate to burn the country down if his hands get cold. His campaign video features him promising tame members of the electorate that he’ll leave the EU on October 31st and saying things like “stop and search” and “wealth creator” while they say things like “lawks, master Johnson you’d make as fine a Prime Minister as Pitt the Elder! Praise good Queen Bess! And bless our boys in the Crimea!”His 1980s-child-star hair cut has been surgically removed and replaced with something more coiffed. But he’s still so unreliable it looks like his own eyes don’t trust his face and are darting around seeking opportunities to escape. You just know that voting for him involves nuclear Armageddon at some point, but sure isn’t that what the Tory rank-and-file want?Matt Hancock doesn’t just like cricket, he loves it and hence his Twitter feed features footage of him playing cricket inside his office. His facility at indoor cricket demonstrates to me more ability than anyone else in the Tory clown car. Unlike some of the others, it’s unclear what his drug of choice is, but going by his following rhetorical question at a recent press conference, it’s probably acid. “If you could choose what time you would be alive? Wouldn’t you choose now?” he asked, and everyone agreed that they would not.Foreign Secretary Jeremy HuntWatch him hereHunt presents himself as a reasonable negotiator, a small business owner, a former Remainer turned pragmatic Leaver, the facilitator of peace talks in Yemen and the London Olympics. Yes, he’s a serious man, not like these flibbertigibbets to his left and right. And yet, I still think the best thing he has done is nearly brain a bystander while ringing a bell.If the Sajid Javid campaign video I just watched is anything to go by he’s a bridge-making Brexiteer who knows how to extricate his nation from the European Union, has a nice family and owns a cute dog. On Twitter he’s going with the hashtag #teamsaj which makes him seem like someone from Love Island but “love” isn’t always the word I’d associate with Javid because I’ve seen him on Question Time. On the other hand, he has a cute dog.The first thing to know about former works and pensions secretary and one-time TV presenter Esther McVey is that Lorraine Kelly hates her. This could be seen in a recent Good Morning Britain interview when, asked if she remembered working with McVey, Kelly replied with a terse “Yeah, yes I do” before changing the subject. Crivens! How has McVey displeased Lorraine Kelly, one of the few pure things left on God’s earth? And what dark times are these, that Kelly’s displeasure does not automatically rule McVey out of the contest?McVey does have some things going for her. She runs a girl-empowerment organisation called If Chloe Can, which provides her with a readymade child army to help push her odd beliefs. She believes, for example, that schoolchildren do not need to know of the existence of gay relationships and that leaving the EU without a deal will be just fine.This sounds like stuff the Tory membership might like. But then you remember that Lorraine Kelly loves each and every one of us, except for Esther McVey. There’s a lot to think about here.All you really know about former chief whip (can any of these people keep a job?) Mark Harper is that he resigned as immigration minister in 2014 when it was discovered his cleaner didn’t have permission to work in the UK. He’s a Remainer-turned-Brexiteer who believes that some extra negotiation period might be required after October 31st. Given his experience as immigration minister, however, there’s a chance he might leave before October 31st by mistake.Former Brexit secretary Dominic RaabWatch him hereWhen Dominic Raab was Brexit Secretary he apparently realised for the first time that Britain was an island that needed to import stuff through Dover. “But what of the King’s mole machines in distant Australia?” he cried, “And the Zeppelins from the moon?” Then he resigned his position in protest over the draft withdrawal agreement he helped to negotiate.Not content with such swivel-eyed loonery, in his campaign video he swivels his whole body, like the girl in The Exorcist, before speaking in a sedated voice about his love of “fairness.”All the Tories are at this now, shamelessly pretending to care about the common man, when their endgame is actually a deregulated free-trade zone where panda meat is broiled on street by scurvy-inflicted urchins and where safari-ing oligarchs can hunt disobedient Irishmen through the asbestos-lined buildings.Oh, his campaign video also features footage of a cargo ship, to demonstrate that he knows about the existence of cargo ships now.Oh, and his neck is roughly the same width as his head, which makes him look like someone has drawn a face on a thumb.Oh, and if you parse “Dominicraab2019” carefully it reads “Domini Craab 2019” signalling, I think, that Raab is an emissary of the Crab People and that 2019 is the year they will Domin-ate. This is a campaign position as sensible as any others I’ve seen today.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Orchid growers like me are even more endangered as there are less and less hobbyist growers every year because no one wants a greenhouse in their back garden.“This means you have to be very careful where you buy them from as large supermarkets who source their orchids from abroad for example sell blue orchids which are dyed and when they grow they will turn white.” Hobbyists and specialist growers are crucial for keeping rare ornamental orchid species alive - while there have been around 30,000 of the pretty plants discovered in the wild, enthusiasts have managed to cross-breed and create over 200,000 different varieties. Orchids at McBean\u0026#39s Orchid Nursery in East SussexGuy Barter, the chief horticultural advisor at the Royal Horticultural Society agreed that the greenhouse use is declining.Although orchid-growing used to be a fascinating hobby taken up by those of small means, he said,  an increasing lack of garden space means that fewer people want to put up greenhouses for the hothouse plants. He added: “Orchid nurseries catering to enthusiasts selling choice rarities are getting fewer. “People are also less willing to heat greenhouses for delicate orchids on grounds of cost and smaller garden mean less space for greenhouses in any case. At one time there were many orchid hobbyists, often people of slender means.  Specialist societies have largely declined as seems to be the case with horticultural societies in general.”Even the most famous gardeners in the country are succumbing to the trend. Gardeners’ World presenter Monty Don, also speaking at the show, said he used to have three greenhouses before recently getting rid of one.He revealed: “We had a greenhouse that i loved and used to grow lettuce and tomatoes in, I had it for 20 years, but the BBC deemed it a health and safety risk as pieces of glass kept falling on people.“I couldn’t afford another one myself and the BBC pointed out I already have two and that seems quite enough.”Sudan crisis: What is happening, and where does it go from here?Comment: There are no women left in the Tory leadership race because none of them were good enoughComment: I\u0026#39d never be able to give up my sentimental bits and bobsFreddie Flintoff on making Top Gear nicer: ‘We’ll have a laugh, but we won’t be nasty’Comment: Attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf have global ramificationsUS releases footage \u0026#39showing Iran removing unexploded mine\u0026#39 from stricken oil tankerComment: A frivolous leadership contest risks tearing the Conservatives apart Prince Charles\u0026#39 Highgrove garden raises £7m for charity as it celebrates 25th anniversary Phone checks on pensioners after they leave hospital can cut readmission rates by almost half One in five people who get tattoos end up infected, experts warnChuka Umunna joins Liberal Democrats as Change UK renamed againSarah Sanders to leave the White House at the end of the monthCommuters with flexible working hours shun rail season tickets, new figures revealComment: Boris Johnson and Michael Gove could be an unbeatable teamGrow up and stop calling me the c-word live on air, Jeremy Hunt tells broadcasters What happens next in Tory leadership race?

All crew members were safely evacuated.Navy Captain Bill Urban, a Central Command spokesman, said the Revolutionary Guard vessel was observed at 4.10pm local time approaching the Kokuka Courageous.He said: It was observed and recorded removing the unexploded limpet mine from the Kokuka Courageous.He added: The United States has no interest in engaging in a new conflict in the Middle East. However, we will defend our interests. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said: Taken as a whole these unprovoked attacks present a clear threat to international peace and security, a blatant assault on the freedom of navigation and an unacceptable campaign of escalating tension by Iran.Mr Pompeo said American assessment of Iran\u0027s responsibility was based on intelligence sources, the weapons used and the level of expertise, saying no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication.In a statement the Iranian mission to the United Nations said Tehran categorically rejects the US unfounded claim with regard to 13 June oil tanker incidents and condemns it in the strongest possible terms.It accused the United States and its allies, including Saudi Arabia, of warmongering.The explosions, which left one of the oil tankers burning outside the strategic Strait of Hormuz waterway, marked the most serious incident since the White House warned in early May that Iran was plotting attacks in the region.    The incident came one month after Iranian forces allegedly used naval mines to blow holes in two oil tankers and two smaller ships off the Emirati port of Fujairah. The US publicly said Iran was behind that attack, while Tehran denied responsibility. Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said “suspicious doesn’t begin to describe” the incident in Gulf of Oman. He previously suggested without evidence that Israel was staging the attacks to undermine Iran.   Responding to Mr Zarif\u0027s comments, Mr Pompeo said:  Foreign Minister Zarif may think this is funny but no one else in the world does.The explosions at sea came hours before Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, met with Ayatollah Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, on a diplomatic mission intended to try to ease tensions between Iran and the US.But the Japanese leader’s efforts appeared to bear little fruit. Ayatollah Khamenei refused to hear any messages from Donald Trump delivered by Mr Abe, the Iranian government said. The ayatollah also said Iran was not seeking nuclear weapons but “America could not do anything” to stop Tehran if it did decide to pursue a nuclear course. Mr Trump on Thursday ruled out the possibility of making a deal with Iran, saying: While I very much appreciate PM Abe going to Iran to meet with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, I personally feel that it is too soon to even think about making a deal. They are not ready, and neither are we!Both tankers were carrying “Japanese-related” cargo, according to Japan’s government. It was not clear if that was a coincidence or if the targeting of the ships was done deliberately to coincide with Mr Abe’s visit to Tehran.   While Iran’s civilian government denies responsibility for any of the attacks, it is possible that the Revolutionary Guard, who answer directly to the supreme leader, are carrying out operations without the government’s knowledge or consent. Iran tries to keep tensions between the two sides concealed but they spilled into the open early this year when Mr Zarif threatened to resign after he was left out of a key meeting while a senior Revolutionary Guard commander was invited.Markets Hub I Brent SpotThe attacks capped six weeks of building tensions between Iran and the US during which time Mr Trump has ordered an aircraft carrier, a bomber taskforce and 1,500 additional troops to the Middle East.  Both the US and Iran say they are not looking for war but Britain and other countries have warned of the danger that the two sides could stumble into an unintended conflict. Antonio Gutteres, the UN secretary general, condemned the attack and warned that the world cannot afford “a major confrontation in the Gulf region”. Any fighting near the Strait of Hormuz, the waterway which transports 20 per cent of the world’s oil, would likely cause serious damage to global energy supplies.Analysts said that Iran appeared to be lashing out in order to send a message in response to crippling US sanctions imposed by Mr Trump after he withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear deal.“I think Iran is showing that it has teeth,” said Charles Hollis, a former British diplomat in Tehran who is now managing director of the Falanx Assynt consultancy. “It’s a way of showing that if they are backed into a corner they are not without means of causing grief.” Iran has warned that it will begin enriching high-grade uranium, the kind that could be used for a nuclear weapon, in July unless Europe finds a way to get around US sanctions and prop up the Iranian oil and banking sectors.  The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

In fact, they have all been produced and distributed by the BBC’s rivals.This week there was uproar after the BBC announced that over-s will now lose the right to their free TV licence, saving around £m per year.And we all know where theyll be splashing this cash - chasing the elusive youth market whove turned away from the BBC in their droves in favour of online streaming services like Netflix, Now TV, and Amazon Prime Video.But as a -year-old who ditched their licence fee last year - instead Im a fully paid-up member of Generation Netflix - I can tell them theyre going about it all wrong.For young people like me, it’s clear that the BBC is stuck in the past. In fact, it’s so out-of-touch that it still offers a discount for anyone whose TV only works in black and white.It’s easy to see how the Beeb’s snooty tone and we-know-best attitude earned it the nickname ‘Auntie’. Today it is more patronising than ever.Lets look at the youth-oriented BBC Three.In an attempt to appeal to young audiences, the channel focuses on niche, politically-correct content, with the latest hits including a show about a niqab-wearing parachutistand an article praising “eco warriors”.The crusty old relic BBC is trying to appear cool and relevant to the youth - but it has been duped into thinking that loud, hysterical snowflakes are representative of an entire generation.It’s clear that the BBC thinks all young people are Jeremy Corbyn-loving lefties so has skewed its content to be hyper left-wing and social justice-oriented to reflect that, when in reality we have erse opinions. Whisper it, but some of us are even right-wing.And BBC Three’s toe-curling Twitter account is a prime example of how not to communicate with young people.The account has done away with grammar entirely, and whoever runs it communicates almost exclusively in gs. Presumably, they think that’s how we all talk, but it’s not cool or edgy… it’s just awkward.Another part of the BBC’s problem is that younger people just don’t consume news and TV the same way as our parents and grandparents.While older people may be happy to wait for the news headlines on TV, we prefer to get our information on demand, via online news sites.Social media outstrips TV as the main news source for young people, with  per cent of - year olds getting their headline fix that way.These websites are less dry than the stale BBC coverage, and at least with other publications you know up-front what their biases are – they don’t pretend to be impartial while peddling a lefty editorial line like the BBC.Just look at todays BBC news headlines for examples of how dull the news can be.Less-than-riveting articles on the site include “How to cope with email overload”, alongside a piece about whether your dining room table was made from illegally-sourced wood and what your bedroom says about you. It’s not exactly gripping, public-interest journalism.In trying to be everything to everyone, the BBC is failing to satisfy anyone - certainly not young people.And it’s not just their online output which shows it up. Just compare what the rest of the BBC is showing to what’s on offer by its rivals.Netflix is currently airing new episodes of the excellent sci-fi series Black Mirror, while Sky Go viewers are going mad for nuclear disaster drama, Chernobyl.Meanwhile, the top shows on BBC iPlayer at the moment include dramas like Casualty and repeats of ancient comedies like Blackadder.And on TV tonight, while ITV has us swooning at Love Island, the BBC will be airing Holby City, Springwatch and… more repeats – this time of Live At The Apollo. Yawn.While these shows may be popular with older audiences, it’s clear that there just isn’t much there for young people.When you can stream a library of millions of shows on a laptop or tablet, it feels a bit backwards to sit down and subject yourself to a TV schedule which someone  has decided for you.Of course, it would be unfair to say that the BBC doesn’t do anything right. Fleabag, Killing Eve and Bodyguard have all proved to be very popular.But the question is: why do we all have to pay for these shows evenwe have no intention of watching them While BBC viewers are forced by law to fork out £. per year for the privilege of owning a TV, Netflix customers can pay as little as £. per year to access an ever-growing library of top-tier tele.Amazon Prime Video is similarly priced at £ per year, while Now TV will set you back £.. Sky is more expensive, but you can still find packages for £ per month.It’s no wonder that Brits are turning away from the Beeb, with nearly a million of us cancelling our licence fees every year in favour of cheaper alternatives.Surely a subscription model, like Amazon Prime or Netflix, would be a fairer way to pay for BBC TV.By scrapping the licence fee for everyone, we could force the BBC – supposedly a public service broadcaster – to actually serve the public.Until then, I’ll stick to Netflix.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The other two cameras didn’t pick it up for some reason.But self-declared experts have said they are certain the footage had not been doctored with computer trickery.And some web sleuths claimed they had the answer to the mystery.They claimed the creature was most likely a skinny child wearing flip-flops and pants on their head.In an interview with Inside Edition, Gomez admitted her son, Bobby, likes to joke around and loves to dance.When asked whether the creature could be her son, Gomez replied: No ... I wouldnt let him out at dark by himself.She also said none of the neighbourhood children looked anything like the creature.Whatever the explanation, many Potter fans were eager to celebrate a possibleof Dobby, as the beloved character tragically died in the sixth film Deathly Hallows.Maury Wills wrote on Facebook: “Dobby came to make sure you are safe!”One Twitter user then added: “Everyone’s joking that this is Dobby but I’m here deciding not to go outside at night ever again.”Eagle-eyed Twitter users pointed out that at one stage in the video there appears to be two shadows which suggests someone could be operating an elf-like puppet.Another explanation offered was that the weird figure was superimposed onto the footage using some clever camera trickery.Reactions to Dobbys death were so emotional that writer JK Rowling was moved to apologise on Twitter in  for killing off the free elf.This year, I apologise for killing someone who didnt die during the #BattleofHogwarts, but who laid down his le to save the people whod win it.

Only six made it back alive.Most of the flights were secret and dozens of dogs lost their lives, but the knowledge gained still helps astronauts today.A few weeks before Gagarin’s flight, Nasa scientists strapped a chimp called Ham into an experimental Mercury capsule.After a -minute flight, the spacecraft splashed down and scientists opened the hatch. Ham seemed to be smiling. Primate experts later described the look on his face as one of utter terror.Dogs proved much more amenable than chimps or monkeys to being strapped into rockets.In the summer of , biologists from the Moscow Aviation Institute spent their evenings driving around looking for stray dogs.Female dogs were chosen due to their size and temperament. The dogs needed to weigh less than lb and be small enough to fit into the nose cone of a rocket.Whenever the scientists spotted a potential stray, they jumped out of their cars with sausage meat in hand.After months of selection and testing,  dogs were chosen.They were shipped out to a secret rocket test site in the desert at Kapustin Yar, near Stalingrad, now Volgograd.In the early hours of July , , the first two dogs were ready for blast-off. Tsygan, translated as Gypsy, and Dezik were loaded into a sealed compartment at the top of a cigar-shaped experimental rocket.Just before dawn, chief rocket engineer Sergei Korolev gave the order to launch.Tsygan and Dezik struggled against the pressure of acceleration. Then,  miles above the Earth — as they became the highest-ever living creatures — the dogs’ compartment separated and began to fall back to the ground.During these  seconds, the animals would have experienced weightlessness.As the dogs neared the ground, parachutes opened to slow their fall.When ground crew opened the hatch, not only were the dogs alive, they seemed to be no worse for wear from their adventure.A few days later, on July , Dezik was once again strapped into the top of a rocket for a second of these suborbital parabolic flights, accompanied by another dog, Lisa.As the dogs’ compartment plummeted, no parachute opened and the animals were killed.Tsygan was retired and lived for another ten years at the home of a space scientist.By , the Soviet space programme had relocated to a larger and more isolated site. A new rocket would achieve a speed of almost seven miles per second, enough to escape the planet’s gravity and reach orbit.On October , Korolev launched the first satellite, Sputnik .Circling the Earth every  minutes, the beeping silver sphere sent America into a frenzy.Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev demanded another spectacle within a month, just ahead of the th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.Laika, another stray from the streets of Moscow, fulfilled his wishes when she became the first dog to orbit the Earth, in Sputnik . The craft weighed more than half a tonne and the new padded and windowless space dog compartment had air-con.It was also equipped with a feeding system, and a vacuum cup to remove waste.But there was a problem — the technology did not exist to get safely back to Earth.On November  Laika blasted off from the new Baikonur Cosmodrome. Readings of her pulse and breathing suggest she was frightened by the initial acceleration but relaxed when the capsule reached orbit and she became weightless.But within minutes of the spacecraft reaching orbit, the living compartment began to overheat and cooling fans could not cope.With temperatures reaching more than C, it is now certain that Laika died after about two hours. At the time, no one in Russia or where, except those working on the mission, knew the truth.Soviet media declared that Laika was alive and well. Five months later her remains were destroyed when the satellite burned up as it re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere.In the US, animal rights groups protested about the flight and cruelty of the one-way mission.But across the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, Laika was celebrated as a heroine.She was the first of the space dogs to be commemorated in books, on stamps and postcards.You could buy Laika-branded cigarettes and matches and her image was printed on ornaments, paperweights, clocks and watches. Although the sub-orbital flights continued, orbital flights were put on hold until Korolev could perfect a means of bringing the animals back alive.Dogs Belka and Strelka launched in August , alongside two rats,  mice and a selection of insects, cultures of microbes and seeds.Sputnik  was the second attempt to send dogs into orbit andthem safely to Earth.The spacecraft was far more sophisticated than Laika’s.As well as TV cameras, it incorporated solar cells for power and a refrigerated cooling system.After  orbits, Korolev gave the command to slow the spacecraft down and drop it out of orbit.Belka and Strelka plummeted to Earth at more than G. At ,ft the parachutes opened. The dogs were unharmed and wagged their tails to greet their masters.The public reaction was overwhelming — here were two of the cutest and happiest dogs, back on Earth after flying in space.The pair were introduced to VIPs and appeared with their handlers on TV as chat show guests. They were superstars with all the mass-produced memorabilia to match.They were portrayed smiling in spacesuits, peering out of rocket portholes or driving side by side in stylised space ships, whizzing around among the stars. There were figurines, animations, books and stories.On May , , America finally managed to get astronaut Alan Shepard off the ground and back to Earth on a -minute sub- orbital flight.The Vienna Conference of  was the first opportunity for Khrushchev to meet US President John F Kennedy.Both leaders were wary. But during dinner, First Lady Jackie Kennedy turned to the subject of space dogs.By now Strelka had given birth to a healthy litter of puppies and Jackie suggested that Khrushchev should send her one.A few weeks later, the White House received an unexpected delivery from the Soviet Embassy — a puppy with a Russian passport.The FBI combed through the fur of the tiny dog, checking it for surveillance bugs. But space puppy Pushinka was allowed to stay.When the Cuban Missile Crisis threatened to kick-off World War Three in October , having Pushinka in the White House may have played a role in helping the leaders step back from the brink.White House Welsh terrier Charlie took a particular shine to the Russian female and in June  the pair became the proud parents of a litter of puppies.The Kennedys decided to give two of the puppies away to American children.It is likely that somewhere in America, descendants of those dogs are alive today. When Yuri Gagarin parachuted to Earth in April , using the technology pioneered by Belka and Strelka, he succeeded them as a new national space hero.But the Russians planned one last canine space effort.On February , , space dogs Ugolek and Veterok had launched into orbit in an adapted Voskhod capsule. The mission took them high above the Earth, through the Van Allen radiation belts.Eventually, after  days, the retrorockets fired and the dogs came back to Earth.Their first steps were shaky but they survived physically unscathed.Ultimately, the dogs helped enable the Soviets to establish space stations and added to Nasa confidence in sending astronauts to the moon. The legacy of the Soviet space dogs lives on in the souvenirs and memorabilia of the early space race.In , a monument to Laika was unveiled in Moscow, and some of the dogs’ space capsules are on display in the city’s Cosmonautics museum.Today’s astronauts living for months on end on the International Space Station, or those training for ato the moon and trip to Mars, still owe their comfort and safety to the pioneering efforts of stray dogs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Told many Tory MPs say he’s the right man to sort out the country, Mr Amin replied: A lot of Germans thought that Hitler was the right man for them. Told that was a shocking comparison he added: Yes. I’m not saying Boris Johnson wants to send people to the gas chamber. Clearly he doesn’t, he’s a buffoon. But he as far as I’m concerned has insufficient concern about the nature of truth for me to ever be a member of a party that he leads.  Mr Johnsonaposs opponents have ganged up by committing to appear on TV leadership debates on Sunday and Tuesday, where Channel  has said he will be represented by an empty chairhe refuses to take part. Mr Johnsonaposs spokesman has said the MP - pursued for his cowardice by the Mirror Chicken yesterday - is in discussions with broadcasters. But in a joint statement, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock, and Rory Stewart said the leadership contest was a critical moment for both the UK and the Conservative party. The frontrunner has so far taken just six questions from journalists in his highly stage-managed campaign, and has been refusing media requests for interviews. As he opened up a near-unbeatable gap, pulling  votes ahead of his six rivals, one demanded to know what have you got to hide . Jeremy Hunt - who is leading the race to be the aposnot Borisapos candidate - slammed him this morning saying: This is the th time Iaposve been on the Today programme in the last year and heaposs just done it once. He said Mr Johnson is hiding away from the media, not taking part in these big occasions. And he warned: We could be heading for a re-run of the  campaign where we effectively had a coronation without much scrutiny. . And Johnson is under pressure on white lines  The driver of a car regularly driven by Boris Johnson was fined £ for parking outside the lines. It comes after the Tory leadership contender admitted on Tuesday he may have broken the mph speed limit. The ticket on the Toyota, left outside the south London home he shares with partner Carrie Symonds, was issued on May  for parking across two pay-and-display bays. The ticket was issued to the green people carrier, which Mr Johnson is regularly seen driving, on May  at .am. The reason for the fine is given on the notice from Kensington and Cha Council as not parked correctly in the markings of the bay.    . Meanwhile, in Brexit... Firms should start preparing for a no-deal Brexit because they cannot afford to put their faith in politicians to to break the current impasse, a business group has warned. The Institute of Directors said companies should use the time until October  to ensure they understand their potential exposure to leaving the EU without a deal and to take sensible precautions. The IoD said its research showed the proportion of its members who had activated contingency plans increased slightly between January and April, from % to %. But more than half of firms had still not engaged in any contingency planning and only % said they would be using the extension period to pick up the pace. It comes as a number of candidates have said they would be willing to take the UK out of the EU without a deal and Labour lost a bid to give power to parliament to avoid no deal.

Two years on tens of thousands of people are still living in unsafe buildings, families are still waiting to the rehoused and fire service funding has been cut. That is why the Daily Mirror has launched its “Grenfell, Never Again” campaign. We are calling for dangerous cladding to be removed from all buildings, the reversal of cuts to fire authorities, sprinklers to be fitteddeemed advisable, an independent regulator to champion tenants’ rights and for an independent authority to oversee the fire service.    Grenfell United’s Karim Mussilhy told the Mirror: “It’s unbelievable that in modern Britain, two years after Grenfell, people are still living in homes that are not fit and buildings that are not safe.” The Government’s own figures show that there are still  high rise and public buildings still clad in the same aluminium compositematerial used on Grenfell Tower. This includes  residential blocks,  hotels and  student accommodation buildings. A further , buildings, including  high rises, are clad in other potentially combustible buildings such as high pressure laminate.  This includes , buildings like hospitals, care homes, schools and hotels that have flammable exteriors but are not high rises. The Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government says ACM cladding has been removed from  buildings since the fire. Grenfell survivors have warned that a “Grenfell Two” is “in the post” because of the Government’s failure to act. Two years after the fire some former residents are still waiting for a permanent home. Of the  households from Grenfell,  remain in temporary accommodation. Fire safety regulations have not been updated and their call for an independent regulator to protect tenants remains unanswered.  “The problem is that it has become increasingly clear than in most cases, those in power simply aren’t interested in acting on our concerns,” said Grenfell United, which represents survivors, in a briefing published to mark the second anniversary of the tragedy. In the wake of the deadly fire in Lakanal House, south London, in  the coroner wrote to the then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles recommending the government encourage the retrofitting of sprinklers in high-rise flats.

We urgently need all blocks to be made safe, including fitting or upgrading fire safety doors. The Mirror believes sprinklers should be retrofitted when deemed necessary by a risk assessment.

Minimum standards should be set for response times and crewing levels. The number of fire safety officers has fallen from  in  to  in . As a result, the number of inspections has fallen from , audits in England in - to , in - - a fall of %. The FBU says there should a new independent authority to oversee the fire service and minimum standards set for crewing and response times. FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said: “After a decade of austerity, the fire and rescue service is hanging by a thread. With slowing response times and massive cuts to firefighter jobs, a sprinkler system, where appropriate, could make the crucial dference, saving a building from complete destruction.“ “Warnings from residents of unsafe conditions at Grenfell fell on deaf ears. Grenfell was a tragedy born from years of neglect and a community abandoned by the political establishment.  “We need to end the persistent brutal cuts to the fire and rescue service. One in five firefighter jobs have been slashed, fire stations have been closed and crewing levels have been reduced. Resources have been stretched thin, leaving communities exposed. “Fire safety officers are essential to catching dangerous fire risks early on. Massive cuts to their numbers and creeping interventions from the private sector are leaving risks like those at Grenfell unnoticed.” Campaign group JusticeGrenfell was set up in the chaotic days following the tragedy, and is working to provide justice for the bereaved, survivors, those evacuated and the wider community. Backing the Mirror campaign, group co-ordinator Yvette Williams said: “It’s the second anniversary of the fire at Grenfell Tower. We have got a delay in the inquiry and no recommendations for change have been made - and there are things that should be done urgently to save further loss of le. “The things the Daily Mirror is raising around the removal of cladding, the installation of sprinklers and the need for resources for the fire service are urgent needs and need to be implemented now rather than waiting another one or two years down the line. “This does not just effect the Grenfell community but has an impact across the entire nation.” The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan , also backed the Mirror’s campaign.He said: “Two years on from the tragic fire at Grenfell Tower, the Government’s lack of action is utterly shameful: the local community feels ignored, there are still people whose homes were destroyed living in emergency and temporary accommodation, and building regulations are still unfit for purpose. Residents in blocks of flats across London and the rest of the country continue to live in fear that their homes are unsafe. I welcome the Mirror’s campaign to hold ministers to account and urge them to adopt these changes.” A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “There is nothing more important than supporting those affected by the Grenfell Tower tragedy and making sure the lessons are learnt so this never happens again. “We’ve allocated £milion for the removal and replacement of dangerous ACM cladding on high-rise homes and are working with councils to ensure this work is completed. “We have issued unambiguous advice to building owners  months ago to reinforce existing building safety requirements and tell building owners what to do to make sure their cladding system is safe.

More than , dolphins, porpoises and whales were found in that time. The dead mammal measured . metres long, which is on the short side of things for an adult. Not a huge amount is known about the pygmy whalesapos habitat, although the UK is believed to be the northern most end of its range.    It is one of just two whales which releases ink. As a means to ward off predators it squirts out the red liquid, which is produced from faecal matter. The animal had one eye missing, which was likely pecked out by birds. The CSIP will now examine the body at the Zoological Society of London. Its project manager Rob Deaville said: It probably ended up in Carmarthenshire because the area is flat, gently shelving and very tidal. We think that it was nutritionally challenged as it was slightly thin and there was no evidence of recent ingestion of prey.    They usually eat squid and octopus and there were round circular marks around its mouth which would suggest this. We found a lot of hair-like parasites and multiple squid beaks in its stomach. There was a lot of froth in its airway which would suggest that it was a live stranding. It died probably because it was alive when it was stranded. The marine biologist said an autopsy would determine how the animal died.Mr Deaville said: We’re looking at dferent possibilities – chemical contaminants in the environment, physical pollution such as plastics, noise pollution from shipping and certain offshore industries, bycatch from fishing, or a dferent cause of death altogether.” Anyone who comes across a dead whale, dolphin or porpoise is urged to contact the CSI programme by visiting UKstrandings.org Any live strandings should be reported immediately to the RSPCA.

Carpets of the black insects cover the floor in wiggling, writhing masses that have spooked locals in Lazorevy in Russiaaposs Ural Mountains. The influx of the household flies have left residents fearing for their health amidst concerns of typhus and cholera outbreaks. All efforts by officials and townsfolk to destroy the buzzing occupants have failed so far, with nearby shops out of spray.    Resident Elena Karpova said: “They are everywhere, we are choking on them. “We are living asin a rubbish dump. “We cannot open the windows, or go outside, or hang out the washing. “They are everywhere, in our baths, on cars, all over dining tables, everywhere.    aposWe dare not go outside. “Our children walk in the street with flies crunching under their feet.” The flies are breeding at incredible speed, feeding fears that the insectsapos reign is not likely to end soon. A man known simply as Anton said: “This is some sort of hell.    “The road is plastered with files so that the surface is not visible. “And when you drive, there is horric crackling sound under wheels. “Itaposs hot now but we cannot even open windows. “We are worried for ourselves and children because flies transmit all sorts of infections. “It is also not clear what to do with our local harvest of apples and pears, they are all covered in flies. “Are they safe to eat ” Blame for the nightmare has been heaped on farmer Andrey Savchenko who fertilised his fields with chicken droppings and waste from a poultry plant.    Ecologists claim his use of this fertiliser has led directly to the explosion of flies. Environmentalist Evgeny Tyulkov said: “The flies lay eggs- it is a good nutrient medium. “They breed in huge numbers in it.” But farmer Savchenko hit back at the suggestion, arguing that pinning blame on him would be impossible. “There is no label on a fly saying it came from me, he said. “If itaposs from me, then itaposs necessary to study the flyaposs flight, where it is going  “Flies have been around for millions of years, they are always around, the question is their number.” The Russian Investigative Committee - which handles serious crime - has launched a probe.    Experts have been tasked with officially establishing the cause of the fly epidemic. There are accusations that “dangerous waste” including chicken innards was placed on local fields “without permission”. If so, those responsible could face two years in jail. Maxim Maximov, head of the poultry farm, insisted the fertiliser they use is the best in the world.“The fault is with hot weather ,” he claimed.“A humid spring, then a sudden warming created favourable conditions for flies to breed.” He claimed he was seeking to cover the fields with chicken waste to prevent flies from breeding more.

Tibi Moravckik headed to the ticket office at High Brooms station in Kent after falling off his bike. The -year-old Tunbridge Wells man asked for something to clean up the blood and bruises on his arms. Rather than receiving a helpful plaster however, Tibi was treated to a sharp insult. I came to the station and told him something like aposI need a ticket to London, but firstly please could you help me with a first aid kit  I had an accident on my bike going downhill to the stationapos, he said.    At this point in the exchange the member of staff began to insult Tibi, he claimed, prompting the dad to take out his phone and start filming. The footage shows his bloodied hand and wrist in front of the railway worker, who then rushes out of the door of the ticket office. As Tibi stands calmly the man waves his arms and hurries towards him. Get out of this f****** station now, the ticket assistant shouts.    The dad-of-one said: I called  and the British Transport Police came about  minutes later. The police were nice, they gave me first aid and asked what happened. They were really professional. One officer helped me and the other spoke with him and watched the stationaposs CCTV. I was really disappointed from his reaction. He didnapost try to help at all. Instead he was angry and aggressive. I cannot imagine reacting like that in his shoes.    While Tibi did not suffer any serious injuries, the emotional effects of the incident could linger. I work as security in a local pub, he said.

And earlier this year Bloomberg found that Amazon employees listen to these recordings and occasionally annotate an “extremely small sample” of them for training purposes.    Amazon team members can listen to as many as , clips during a nine-hour sht, according to Bloomberg. The Seattle lawsuit claims that Alexa records people regardless of whether they purchased the device or signed up to use the Alexa app, and doesn’t warn unregistered users that they’re being recorded. The suit goes on to allege that Amazon is violating laws in Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Washington by not obtaining explicit consent. The lawsuit claims that Amazon is using the data to glean the habits and personal information of children and “has strong commercial incentives to collect as many Alexa recordings as possible.”    If the court finds in favour of the plaintf, the lawsuit wants Amazon to delete all recordings of underage users and prevent future recordings unless the user grants consent. Alexa owners can manage how Amazon reviews their data via the Alexa app, but you need to opt-out of the “help develop new features” option. Following the Bloomberg report, Amazon introduced a new feature to have Alexa delete all of your voice recordings, but you have to opt in to activate the deletion command and it will only delete your recordings from the current calendar day.

The farm provides milk for ultrafiltered brand fairle, which is a partner of the Coca-Cola Company.    Mike McCloskey, the farmaposs co-founder, said the company took full responsibility for the abuse shown and said all associated employees had been fired.

Things then took a turn. She continued, saying: To my counselor, thank you for letting me fend for myself - you were always unavailable to my parents and I despite appointments. Only in these past few weeks with the award ceremonies and graduation coming up did you begin making your appearance. You expressed to me your joy in knowing that one of your students be valedictorian when you had absolutely no role in my achievements.    To the staff in the main office, thank you for teaching me how to be resorceful. Your negligence to inform me of several scholarships until the day before they were due potentially caused me to miss out on thousands of dollars.To the teacher that was regularly intoxicated during class this year, thank you for using yourself to teach these students about the dangers of alcoholism. Being escorted out of school by police left a lasting impression. She finished her speech with a powerful message for all listening: To future students and staff - learn from these examples. Thank you Class of . This was met with roaring applause from her fellow graduates, many of whom gave her a standing ovation.    Her speech has since gone viral on social media, where she has been branded a hero. One person proclaimed: Sheaposs a hero!!! We need more accountability from teachers and schools! Another commented: This b**** deserves an Emmy or something. A third added: We all need a Nataly Buhr as a classmate. However the school and Sweetwater Union High School district werenapost so impressed. Manuel Rubio, a spokesperson for the school district, said: Itaposs unfortunate that the words of a student like this are taking away from the positive. There are a lot of teacher working very hard for our students, itaposs unfortunate that she decided to air grevances. We think that the studentaposs speech was inappropriate and out of line. Despite this, Natalyaposs mother, Monica Serratos says sheaposs proud that her daughter had the confidence to make the speech and the teenager has also defended her comments, telling KHOU she hoped her words encourage others to speak up.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

That revenue would have contributed towards the management and improvement of assets and development of services within the Ardrishaig area for years ahead and for the benefit of current and future generations.Edward Laughton, director, Ardrishaig Community TrustSir,We often hear Argyll and Bute Council being slated.But this time they deserve all the praise they can get for cleaning and re-pointing Lochgilphead War Memorial. All it took was a request and the work was done in time for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day on June .Geordie Rhodick, chairman, LAFDSirFor the past two years, since he was elected to Argyll and Bute Council by the skin of his teeth, Councillor Alastair Redman has bombarded local newspapers with a constant stream of drivel attacking the Scottish Government.In his latest diatribe, he alleges that #the SNP has completely misjudged the mood of voters up and down the country#.I know it will be extremely painful for him, buthe can bring himself to review last week’s European Election results in Scotland, he’ll see the complete fallacy of this statement, andhe wants to look even closer to home, he’ll see that the SNP polled , votes in Argyll and Bute – , votes ahead of the Tories who came a distant fourth.Hardly a sign of his mythical assertion that Ruth Davidson is poised to be the next First Minister of Scotland.Robert Macintyre, Serpentine Road, RothesayDear PaulI write on behalf of constituents in Tarbert regarding the application for the Inveraray to Crossaig kV overhead line, which is with the [Scottish Government] Energy Consents Unit.A very large number of constituents have contacted me regarding this matter and almost  have signed a petition.They believe the proposal will have a major deleterious effect on the village and will be a huge and ugly blot on the landscape which, given the very attractive and scenic nature of the area, will be a big disincentive to tourism and will spoil the enjoyment of the area for residents as well.I have met with SSE to discuss this issue and have made it clear to them that the community wishes the company to come forward with alternative proposals, which must include undergrounding the cableno route can be found which does not spoil the visual amenity of the village.I know that the new line is needed for entirely understandable and positive reasons, and I have had only a few complaints from other parts of the area which will be affected.The opposition in Tarbert is virtually unanimous and there is also concern being expressed from those who know and value the area but do not live there.I hope that any consideration of consent will ensure that this issue is dealt with in accordance with the views of local people and I would be grateful to hear from you what the timescale is for that decision .Michael RussellSir,Newly-elected UK MEPs will take their seats in the European Parliament in July and it is crucial they recognise their signicant role in shaping the policies that impact on farming businesses. This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle. The race committee nonetheless got two races in for a number of the fleets.Protests concluded, Saturday’s prize giving announced the remaining results from Friday. This showed #s winner and RC Makars Mash class yacht Storm looking strong with a first place.Chimaera showed early signs of being a threat to the Scottish Series crown, taking a first in Friday racing. With no immediate showing of a dominant yacht in the IRC Class  fleet from Friday’s races, it was IRC class four that showed a brewing battle between Lady Ex and F’n Gr. In the CYCA Class  fleet, First by Farr surfaced with the highest number of race wins from Friday.Not to be outdone, CYCA Class  saw the final results dominated by Cool Bandit  before Saturday#s results were announced. With the weather mixing up the league table for Saturday, there were a lot of yachts taking home prizes.Saturday evening saw theof Big Vern and The Shootahs to the Scottish Series for another year and a spectacular fireworks display in celebration of Valhalla of Ashton’s th year on the water.Sunday saw yet another big weather sht with forecasts up to  knots. Loch Fyne likes to mix it up a bit so the fleets ventured out into more sedate conditions than those forecast. But as the weather built, race officers shortened the traditional round Inchmarnock passage race.Sunday prizes featured an additional prize for the best performer in each fleet. Glenn Porter started proceedings with a special award for #assisting mark layers# to the competitor who got tangled up in one of the race marks. In IRC Class  it was El Gran Senor and Forty Licks shining through. The Makars Mash RC class saw Hijacker leading the prize haul. In IRC Class it was Mata taking the #extra# prize. IRC class four saw F’n Gr take a clean sweep of firsts in both races. With only one race in CYCA  and , it was Reflection and Salamander XXII taking home the wins. In the Etchells One,  Design Hero took a win in both races with Squawk leading the way in the Sigma  One Design Class. In the Hunter  fleet Miss Moneypenny was the only yacht placed in both races taking home the best performer of the day for the s. With two firsts in the Sonata one design, Fiddlesticks made the most of the Sunday conditions. Finally, the CYCA restricted sail fleet saw Celtic Spirit take first place.The  event saw the marquee remain open for the Sunday evening as part of additional shoreside activities supported by Event Scotland.An earlier start on Monday was greeted with sunshine and no wind. This time the challenge was just too much for race officers who had to abandon racing for the day. Despite a number of the competitors making the most of the early finish and heading home, the final prize giving was one of the best attended in recent years.Clyde Cruising Club Commodore John Readman paid special thanks to the valued participants, sponsors, supporters, volunteers and locals, without whom there would be no event.Scottish Series Trophy and overall Series Winner: #Chimaera#Joe Deane Cup and Knox Anchor: Salamander XXIRosebowl: ChimaeraTunnocks# Cup: ReflectionCrinan Cup: Celtic SpiritCrawford McInnes Trophy : ReflectionLemarac Tankard: Celtic SpiritCauseway Cup: F#n GrAlfred Mylne Trophy: HeroClyde Bowl: Celtic SpiritValhalla of Ashton Salver volunteer Award: The Tech or Raynet TeamLa Rochelle Trophy: LyrebirdThe McIver Salver : F#n GrIRC: Forty LicksRC: ChimaeraIRC: HarmonyIRC: F#n GrCYCA: First by FarrCYCA: Salamander XXIICYCA: Celtic SpiritSigma  OOD: Leaky Roof Sonata OD: FiddlesticksHunter  OD: SeawordEtchells OD: HeroIRC: Something ElseCYCA: First EditionOne Design: Miss Moneypenny,  Class Association"},{"url":null,"title":"kyles defeat inveraray in camanachd cup","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsKyles Athletic are through to the quarter finals after beating Inveraray - at Kames Playing Fields.The opening goal came on  minutes following a scramble around the penalty spot.

The music was provided by Gordon Cosgrove and Katrina Barr.For some, it will have been the youth groups that gave a point of contact with the church. These have existed under ious names – CHAOS with Sam and Jon Philips, Youth Fellowship run by Sian Galbraith and, currently, SKY , led by John Ives and the present pastor, Steve Davies.These have given young people a place to meet together and explore the Christian faith.Steve Davies indicated that the event planned for Saturday evening will aim to blend together three elements: #a historical flavour, a strong musical focus and a thanksgiving celebration#, and he added that there will be a chance to reminisce over refreshments and enjoy a display of photographs showing activities and events of days gone by.A church outing in the s.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

Tranentrsquos eastern edge, despite the land being earmarked solely for economic development.Developers insisted that the only way to bring businesses onto the site was by generating funds from the sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  BBC   s disgraceful excesses have brought about this sorry mess","story":"As the BBC announces that from June  it will end free TV licences for over-s who do not receive pension credit, nostalgia for the Beeb of old will be tinged not just with regret but a sense of betrayal. Of course there will be thousands of this vintage who can cough up pound without a second thought, barely denting their cruise-ship budget or round-the-world jaunts. But we should be in no doubt there are just as many who, eventhey do not qualy for pension credit, will have to cut back on other essentials in order to secure this leline. And beyond them, hidden in the shadows, are those in serious poverty, who are too proud, too isolated or too uninformed, to apply for benefits they are due.The argument over whether the licence fee should be free for the elderly, however, is not, and should never be, entirely about affordability. It is a question of principle. We live in an age in which digital entertainment and news provision has become a Wild West frontier, offering myriad possibilities for those with access to online services, the skill to navigate them, and the cash to pay. Netflix, Sky, Amazon Prime and others all clamour for custom, chipping away at the BBCrsquos once-monolithic status. For a business with a glut of extremely well-paid captains at the helm, the corporation has been astonishingly slow to recognise the threat viewersrsquo changing habits pose to its future.I doubt there is anyone under  who would not blithely go where without a momentrsquos regret. Doubtless they already wonder why they should pay a licence on top of other subscription fees, especially when they can also stream much of what they want for free. But those who are over , who grew up with John Reithrsquos dream, are umbilically attached. The BBC schedule is the clock around which their day is constructed, be it The Archers, Test Match Special, the Six OrsquoClock News, or The Antiques Roadshow. Without this devoted audience, the BBC would have shrivelled long ago. It is to these stalwarts that Lord Reithrsquos baby owes its existence, and its prestige. To turf them overboard when money grows tight is not just disgraceful, it makes no sense.Announcing this decision, in the tones of a funeral director sorry for their loss, the BBC Chairman and Director-General explained the arithmetic in such a way that it seems there is no alternative. The end of Government funding for free licences will leave a pound million hole in its bank account. The alternative, they said, would be to close stations such as BBC Two and Four, the BBC News Channel, the BBC Scotland Channel and Radio  Live, among others, all of which, clearly, is deemed unthinkable.Read more: Tories accused of broken promise in free TV licence rowYet the time for the unthinkable is not today. It was not even four years ago, when Westminster gave notice of pulling its subsidy. The moment for a strategic rethink and recalibration was  and more years ago. At that point, the exponential expansion of digital s was already transforming peoplersquos relationship with screen and sound. This was when the BBC needed to look hard at its role and purpose and come up with a remodelled, leaner profile, fit for a new century. Instead, it has continued to expand, astomorrow will never arrive.Many of the over-s, a generation bred to thrt, will be puzzled by the Beebrsquos fiscal philosophy. Stories of extravagant pay-outs and salaries, of a costly failed IT project, of wastefulness and excess, have dented its reputation as a wise user of licence fees. Surely, instead of penalising those on whose loyalty it has been built, it should be narrowing its focus and making ends meet For far too long the corporation has had delusions of grandeur. In trying to position itself as a front-runner in global as well as regional news, in attempting to capture every market and age group, it has spread itself too thin. In the process, its online sites have imperilled the existence of commercial media companies whose survival is not protected by licence-fee payers, as have its magazines.This is not to suggest giving programme-makers even fewer resources with which to produce the same output. Rather, it is to ask for a radical streamlining, a concentration of energies and talent, on the things the BBC has always done brilliantly: drama, documentaries, music and news. Instead of courting fickle youth, it should be actively nurturing and sustaining older viewers who depend upon it. Axing their free pass is not only an easy and predictable response, but unimaginative and short-sighted ndash symptoms, you might say, of what already ails it."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9816553.jpg?type=article-full","title":"human-remains-discovered-in-dumfries-and-galloway-in-search-for-emma-faulds","story":"The -year-oldwas reported missing to police on Tuesday, April .The last confirmed sightingwas around .pm on April  when she was in Monkton, Ayrshire.Police searches had been focused around Barrhill, particularly along the A between Girvan and Newton Stewart.Police have discovered human remains in their search for Emma FauldsPolice Scotlandconfirmed that human remains havebeen found as part of their investigation into her disappearance.A spokeswoman said: ldquoOn Wednesday, June , human remains were discovered in the Galloway Forest, Dumfries and Galloway.ldquoThe family of Emma Faulds has been made aware.ldquoEnquiries are ongoing.Last month a man appeared in court charged with the murder of Ms Faulds.Ross Willox was also charged with attempting to defeat the ends of justice on May  before ing to Ayr Sherf Court a week later for a second hearing.The -year-old from Ayrshire made no plea and was remanded in custody."},{"url":null,"title":"how-to-identify-and-get-rid-of-bedbugs-everything-you-need-to-know","story":":Scandal of Scottish schools four-year fight to kill off bedbugsFeasting on the blood of animals and humans, the small insects can leave a painful, itchy bite, often on exposed areas.Detecting bedbugsSigns of bedbugs can be hard to identy however there are some things to look out for including:While bedbugs do not fly or \"nest\" femalebedbugs may lay hundreds of eggs, each of which is about the size of a speck of dust.Getting rid of bedbugsIt can be a dficult task removing bed bugs once they have infested asthey can be resistant to some insecticides.In order to remove bed bugs: Clean bedding, linens, curtains, and clothing in hot water and dry them on the highest dryer setting Use a stf brush to scrub mattress seams to remove bedbugs and their eggs.:Community effort praised after bedbug outbreak at Glasgows St Brides PrimaryHoover your bed and surrounding area frequently.Encase mattress and box springs with a tightly woven, zippered cover to keep bedbugs from entering or escaping.

What she did say was that Brexit was a threat to Scotlandrsquos democracy and prosperity, which is where the word ldquovalues came in. ldquoThe deadlock at Westminster over Brexit, she said, ldquois going to lead to a world view even more at odds with Scotlandrsquos values and even more damaging to our future.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Nicola Sturgeon meets Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier in Brussels\",\"description\": \"Nicola Sturgeon meets Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier in Brussels\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer thumbs VilFgCKH-.jpg\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests VilFgCKH.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Now, you may think big speeches like this one donrsquot matter as much as they once did and I can understand that ndash besides, tweets donrsquot take as long to write. But a speech like Mrs Sturgeonrsquos is a good opportunity to hear what a leader says theyrsquore thinking, as well as a chance to work out what theyrsquore actually doing. Mrs Sturgeonrsquos speech was promoted in advance as a statement of support for EU membership and shared European values. Therersquos the V word again.However, there are several problems with the concept of values in politics ndash all of which were on display in Mrs Sturgeonrsquos speech. The first is the definition: what on earth does ldquoScottish values mean  But more worrying is what happens when you promote one set of values over another. By definition,ldquoour values exist then so must ldquotheir values in other words, while purporting to promote similarity, the V word actually emphasises the dference. It isnrsquot a kind of glue, itrsquos a wedge.: Nicola Sturgeon calls Jeremy Hunt childish and pathetic after Brussels snubSo, did we get an indication from Mrs Sturgeon about what she thinks ldquoScottish values means  Well, there was some talk about fairness and internationalism, but the First Minister might as well have said that Scotlandrsquos values were all kinds of everything: sailboats and fishermen, wishing wells and wedding bells. That, at least, would have been closer to the truth because when many people talk about Scottish values, what they really seem to be talking about is symbols: hills and glens and flags.The idea that Scottish people have ldquovalues also fails to understand how a country ndash or humanity for that matter ndash works. I was brought up in a family of four, in the same way, in the same country, but my siblings and I have dferent views on most issues ndash in other words, we have dferent ldquovalues and the same dferences occur outside of families. I share some ideas with some Scots, but I self-evidently donrsquot with others. My Scottishness, and your Scottishness, is irrelevant.If you donrsquot believe me, I challenge you to tell me what Scotlandrsquos values are. Perhaps itrsquos a sense that we should all be equal, but,so, in what way is believing in equality uniquely Scottish  And the truth is many Scots do not believe in equality ndash those opposed to gay marriage for example. Or perhaps you think our supposed openness to immigration is a Scottish value, but why, in that case, did so many Scots vote for Brexit  In fact, Brexit is not an English value just as pro-Europeanism is not a Scottish value and to say anything  is political vulgarity.And yet Mrs Sturgeon appears to believe Scottish values do exist and therersquos a good reason for that. Nationalists, of the Brexit and Scottish iety, like to talk about values because they like to promote the idea of national identity. This can then be used to justy referendums or independence on the basis that ldquoour values are incompatible with the UK Governmentor the European Union . To do anything , and acknowledge similarities rather than dferences, undermines the case for separateness.This is exactly what Mrs Sturgeon was up to in her speech and it happened again on Thursday when it was announced that Boris Johnson had topped the Tory leadership vote and the SNP reacted by publishing a mock ballot paper showing a choice between Mr Johnson and independence. No doubt, the First Minister would also say Mr Johnson is contrary to ldquoScotlandrsquos values when, in fact, Brexit is merely a policy and Mr Johnson a politician, just as independence and Mrs Sturgeon are, and it can all be changed. Scotland and the UK donrsquot have values, we have governments with policies that will be superseded by governments with dferent policies.:UK Government to get first lsquoCabinet Roomrsquo in EdinburghAnd donrsquot we also have to ask where the concept of national values might take us next  A few years ago, Michael Govedecreed that ldquoBritish values should be taught in English schools, and who was to define those values do you think  Mr Gove, of course, because thatrsquos what happens with values ndash they are always defined by politicians, usually nationalistic ones, rather than parliament or the public. Values are an instrument of nationalism and of the state.Scottish nationalists would argue, of course, that they are dferent, that their values are civic rather than nationalistic, but itrsquos easy to imagine the future government of an independent Scotland insisting on Scottish values being taught in classrooms in the way Mr Gove did with British values. Indeed, I think some nationalists might insist on it to weed out unionists at an early age.Sadly, I can also imagine a Scottish government insisting on the teaching of national pride, another of the consequences of value politics. In her speech in Brussels, Mrs Sturgeon spoke about pride in being a European, and perhaps some Scots would say pride in being Scottish should be one of our values too. But shouldnrsquot we be proud of the things we achieve rather than the things we are  To be proud of a fact you cannot change is fatuous. In fact, I think I can say that is one of my rules for le. It is one of my values."},{"url":null,"title":"comment-eif-and-the-capitals-council-need-to-talk","story":"He seemed confident that the looming pound, cut it is facing can somehow be weathered, at least for the time being.

While this trend is apparent across many ­sectors, one industry that we’ve had first-hand experience of is music. In , the music event sector was worth a whopping £. billion to the UK economy and with the new wave of experience-led events, that figure is set to increase. Music psychology researchers have found that the desire to escape reality in a setting that offers novelty is a key driver for attending a music event. The rising popularity of immersive one-day festivals and the ‘day gig’ is testament to this demand, providing people with the ultimate escape and the chance to party all day long, ­usually from noon to pm. Unlike the daylight raves that took place in fields and warehouses in the s and s, today’s official events benefit from safe spaces, first-rate sound systems and excellent amenities such as those offered by the Royal Highland Centre .The growth of day gigs can be ­evidenced by some of the events held at the RHC such as Terminal V and elrow whichyear after year and attract more than , attendees each. Freddie Norris, UK bookings and karketing manager at club party organisers elrow said: “Promoters like Terminal V and Fly are really pushing the boundaries bringing world class talent to the city. “We made our Edinburgh debut with elrow in  at Hallowe’en, bringing a massive Haunted House at the RHC. The audience response was really positive, and we made a connection both with the crowd and the city which is really important because Edinburgh’s RHC is an ideal location for music events.”Events such as these are bolstering the reputation of Edinburgh as a city that welcomes the day gig. The quality of the event organiser and the suitability of host space is ­crucial to getting the backing from City of Edinburgh Council, that ­ultimately determines whether an event can go ahead.Clearly what’s important is that events of this scale can demonstrate robust health and safety processes and an infrastructure that can cope with such numbers.It’s never been more prevalent to have high security standards for large scale events. The future of events in the city relies on event organisers and venues putting in these procedures to minimise risk to event-goers. At the RHC we work closely with health, safety and ­security ­agencies, including Police Scotland, to plan, manage and reduce incidents. The continuing investment in the RHC as Scotland’s leading events ­venue is ushering in a new age of music events with a capacity of more than , in the main hall, ­combined with  acres of outdoor space and parking space for , vehicles. Freddie added: “We are very excited to be ing to the RHC with our debut festival elrowTown in Scotland. There is so much space for activities at the RHC, and this is a key part of the elrow festival experience, plus it gives us scope to grow the event in the future.”According to EventBrite,  per cent of music festival-goers tweet or post to social media during a live concert. This trend for real-time updates and sharing of experiences has resulted in consumer demand for high-speed WiFi access to be bigger than before. That’s why at RHC we have invested in our infrastructure over the last few years to ensure we can meet this demand at the events we host. Showcasing the need for strong transport links, a survey conducted by EventBrite found that  per cent of millennialswould travel for a concert or festival, and  per cent would stay an extra night after that music event in the area. Boasting direct links to the city centre by tram and a prime location next to the airport and motorway, the RHC is also located nearby to overnight accommodation. Venues like the RHC are leading the charge and helping to put Edinburgh on the map when it comes to music events of all shapes and sizes, thus bringing an influx of vital economic benefits to the

You clearly misunderstood my point, which related to democracy.Clarity is a desirable quality of communication, in itself, neutral. As opposed to democracy, which is a fundamental principle by which we live and are governed.John.Firstly, I neither swore nor used “foul” language.I just failed to prissy it up to the required standard.I didn’t say anything you wouldn’t hear in a nursery playground. Secondly.I did understand what you said but you clearly didn’t understand it yourself.In your example, a party was standing in what was essentially a single-issue election and stated its policy with clarity and precision.Given these very specic factors, under what circumstances would this party be elected by voters who did not support the policy In order to justy your “honouring, then ignoring the plebs” insult, you created a  scenario.Incidentally.It shouldn’t make any dference but when I replied to your comment, I had no party axe to grind.No, Malcolm, it is you, not I, who fail to understand. My point referred to the LibDems conduct during and after the EU referendum # #People#s Vote# # of  June . The recent EU election is merely the latest episode.The Remain-supporting UK government sent a £ million, taxpayer funded leaflet to every UK home, recommending Remain and stating # in big, bold type # that this was a #once in a generation# event, adding, #The government will implement whatever you decide.#No party dissented. Indeed, Nick Clegg repeated it forcefully in a nationwide tv debate .The next day, LibDems leader Tim Farron furiously rejected the outcome . Since then, the LibDems, and others, have campaigned ferociously to reverse the result.They have traipsed around Brussels, encouraging EU negotiators while undermining our own, effectively, #colluding with a foreign power# to wreck Brexit. And all the while demanding a second referendum in which the people would be frightened into voting Remain by the unpalatable EU offer that they helped to ensure.I am unable to recognise that as in any way democratic.John,The fact that a party agrees to hold a referendum or participate in an election does not mean it has to change its stance after the results are announced. The Liberals adopted a pro-European stance in the  advisory referendum as did the Lib Dems in the  advisory referendum.They also presented pro-European policies in all the national and European elections between those dates and up to the present.Their MPs and MEPs have been consistently elected by pro-European voters who expect them to stick to their pro-European election manestoes.There are countless dferent types of constitutional democracies around the World and they are all slightly dferent.If you watch events in the House of Commons, you will notice that there are neat rows of benches provided opposite the government’s benches.They have been there for hundreds of years and they are there for a very special reason.They exist because, in our form of constitutional democracy, the losing side is allowedto continue developing and promoting the positions set out in its own manestoes.The losing parties do this in direct opposition to the policies of the government who were elected by the majority.That is why the losing parties are called “The Opposition” and their existence is not something that contradicts democracy but is, in fact, an essential part of it.You can’t expect the opposition parties to take a vow of silence just because someone put a leaflet through your letterbox in .#The fact that a party agrees to hold a referendum or participate in an election does not mean it has to change its stance after the results are announced. #But the least they should do is respect the result, not demand it is overturned.Ok., Malcolm, I seem to be having dficulty making it through the editorial filter so I#ll have to agree to disagree. Neither have I #a party axe to grind.#Liebe Rosa, you’ve fairly thrown down the gauntlet there!I agree, each translation has issues, but happily help is at hand within Shetland culture. Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in . The final lines guaranteed translation into many other language too:Shall brithers be for a# thatSchiller would also have recognised the romantic sensibilities which informed Shetland’s Up-Helly Aa, or unserer feuer-trunken Faschingsdeinstag, ob du wilst. I think these lines from the closing verse of The Galley Song capture Schiller’s intention perfectly:O’er stre the curtain drawHappy to see Europe inspiring Shetland still!#Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us#Unless of course they#re English eh Peter. You want to separate scotland from the rest of the UK yet come out with the PC BS above. just who are you trying to kid I wondered when the anti- English racist rhetoric would raise its ugly head on here.

Napoleonic Wars were certainly consequential in the rationale behind the companies formation. Particularly the Peninsular war.It wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame I am so sorry, Peter Hamilton, Schiller died two hundred years ago. Have you someone a little more contemporary to bore us with  Tony Benn had some creative thoughts about Europe, as did Jack Jones. They were real socialists and Democrats, not pretentious windbags.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth.

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

However, underlying issues of majority and binary decision-making processes, and the resulting exclusion of certain voices, are ones that have dogged the institutions since the formation of the Northern state. It is this same system of binary voting that has further polarised opinions and furthered tension in the wake of the Brexit vote. Therefore, it is in this broad context that democratic processes advocated by the North Belfast-based de Borda Institute become all the more interesting.Headed up by Ballysillan man Peter Emerson, The de Borda Institute aims to promote the use of inclusive voting procedures on issues of social choice. These procedures are multi-choice and make use of points based voting system popularised by French mathematician Jean-Charles de Borda.Peter began his own professional career in the British Navy, but soon became disillusioned with the role of British Empire, instead viewing colonialism as “part of the problem” in other nations.His ergent path following his naval resignation saw him move to Rwanda, where he worked as a teacher in the s. It was during that time that he began questioning the majority voting systems implemented by Europeans worldwide. When he came to the North of Ireland in , he realised how similar processes had hindered political progress. “Traditional African decision-making is so much better than majority voting,” he explained.“When you look back and realise that Europeans went to Rwanda and applied majority rule. How crazy can you get “I started to question majority rule in Africa. Then I came here in  and realised that it was part of the problem here. My dad was Irish, from Cork, but he was a member of the minority because he was a Protestant. My mum was English, but she was a member of the minority because she was Catholic, so I’m a political b*****d.“We have this stupid thing here where we’re asked whether we’re British or Irish, which I was asked a lot when I arrived here. They have the same in Rwanda – are you Hutu or Tutsi  It’s a closed question. You’re caught because you could be neither, or both, so you can’t answer a question like that.“I realised very early on that the question was part of the Northern Ireland problem. In  there was the Anglo-Irish Agreement and you had Paisley standing outside City Hall protesting. One week later, six of us stood outside the same venue with a banner saying ‘we have got to say yes to something’.“Six months later we brought a number of parties together at a conference to discuss a range of issues. You put down in order of preference what you like and you can see which option has the widest support. We did this in May . We had Sinn Féin, Official Unionists, UDA, Ulster Clubs – you name it – and we had this fantastic meeting. People could suggest anything they like and as long as it didn’t infringe the UN Charter on Human Rights it was allowed.“We finished with  options on the ballot paper and the people came to conclusion that Northern Ireland should have devolution and power sharing within a joint Dublin, London and Belfast tripartite agreement. It was like a mini Good Friday Agreement, but just  years ahead of its time.”The methods – known as the ‘Borda Count’ – employed by The de Borda Institute, are used to determine the highest average vote amongst a number of options, resulting in what should be a more democratic outcome. While western countries pride themselves on being ‘democratic’, Peter said that their use of majority voting calls that self-ascribed description into question.“In Western Europe we often discuss electoral systems, but when it comes to decision-making it has to be a majority vote,” he said.“Sometimes you see complaints about North Korea, and their elections where they have do you want candidate ‘x’, ‘yes’ or ‘no’  Then we go ahead and have Brexit, ‘yes’ or ‘no’ – it’s the same thing. The basic idea of just asking yes or no is too primitive and gives all the power to the person who sets the question. Majority voting has been used by Napoleon, Lenin, Mussolini, Hitler, Pinochet, Duvalier, Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi – you name it – dictators love it. David Cameron wrote the Brexit question. The Electoral Commission says it’s fair – it’s crazy. It’s like asking a vegetarianthey would like beef or lamb.”In the coming months Peter plans to publish a new book entitled ‘Majority Voting as a Catalyst of Populism’, which tells of his overland journey from Belfast to Beijing and back. The book offers an assessment of a number of regions that he visitied that have suffered from majoritarianism, including post-conflict areas such as the Balkans and the North of Ireland. Asked about our own political impasse, Peter said: “Politicians don’t like the idea of giving people a choice. The politician who wants ‘x’ is happy to have it on the ballot paper, and maybe ‘y’, but not ‘z’. If you are a proper democrat and you want the will of the people then you give them the choice to decide. Then whatever they decide you, the Executive, execute. If you totally disagree then you resign.“We go to the polling stations and elect an assembly. If somebody abstains then that’s fine. Those who do want to get on with it can. If the DUP and Sinn Féin don’t want to be there then that’s a pity, but to give them the monopoly or veto is a crazy way of doing things. Part of the trouble is that the Belfast Agreement was designed by people who were part of the problem in the first place. It is a very majoritarian document. They devised this system that gives them control.”He added: “This idea that because one group is bigger or more numerous that they can tell the other where to go is totally primitive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bubbles.png","title":"siomha wows buble","story":"A -year-old Coláiste Feirste pupil wowed Canadiansinging superstar Michael Bublé with her vocal talent at his sell-out concert inthe city on Monday night.

This is the case up until he witnesses the hatred and bigotry directed towards Irish supporters of the now infamous and most politically -charged match between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the  World Cup qualier at Windsor Park.The toxic atmosphere which rained down from the stands was captured in Marie’s prose the match comingjust days after the Shankill bombing and the Greysteel murders.The Fall and Come Home actor Matthew Forsythe fought off  submissions,  self-tapes and “ people in the room which was then whittled down to ,” for the “dream role” of playing Kenneth.“I read it around  and it was and is one of those theatre pieces that I instantly felt a connection with. I saw a lot of me in the part especially growing up in the s and s.”The play on its first initial run was a showcase for actor Dan Gordon who portrayed Kenneth, and later Marty Maguire who toured the production around the States. Matthew explained how when he was trying to get into drama school across the water he contacted Dan for advice and support.“I was holding a charity event to try and raise a bit of money, Dan couldn’t come but he sent me a postcard with a £ cheque in it and the postcard was of Dan in character as Kenneth. I still have it,” he said.Matthew’s further connection to the piece was that he was in the Windsor stands that ‘night in November’having been taken to see the match with his school, Laurelhill High School in Lisburn.In August  Patrick Kielty took on the role of Kenneth, directed by acclaimed actor Ian McElhinney during a run at the Opera House. Fast-forward  years and its Ian and Marie’s son Matthew now in the director’s chair.“The play debuted during a very sensitive, political time,” explained Matthew McElhinney, “the reaction was very funny, very moving and very engaging. There was some controversy over the content, it was seen as being not painting the side of the community my mother came from in the best light, essentially it was a critique of her own community, her own people. Mum was writing about what she saw at the time. Such was its reaction the Lyric had to put on extra security.”Asked about the signicance of the play  years on Matthew spoke of how the play “paints the two sides of football”.“I remember there was talk of bringing the play back to the stage during the Euro’s but mum said it wasn’t the right time.  years is a big anniversary and I kept thinking ‘how am I going to stage this ’ To frame it within the context of that was then, this is now. There has been astounding progress from the ‘Billy Boys’ to being awarded the Grand Vermeil in  during the Euros, for the Northern Ireland fans along with the Republic. It’s a chance to say look at what we have achieved, and the tagline of the play is ‘is it possible to change ’“The play has ups, downs, laughs and emotion. It’s been  years and we are about to have a whole new generation come to see it.”A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre from June -.

He now says he favours a renegotiation of the agreement and wants the backstop to be surrounded by an unambiguous \"exit mechanism\". Has also said that a rebooted Executive Assembly would help to resolve matters and indicated that he would even lead the talks process. Described Karen Bradley as a \"brilliant\" Secretary of State.Success Rating:  Matt HancockA slightly woollier version of Goves position. He wants a time limit on the backstop, although doesnt indicate how long short the limit would be. He has also suggested that a new political negotiations body of some sort - involving Northern Irelands parties - could be established to create North South consensus on a way forward.Success Rating:  Read MoreWho are the contenders in the Tory leadership race Boris Johnson is ‘yesterday’s news’, says Tory rival Sajid JavidMark HarperA former chief whip with a reasonably good nose for what the parliamentary party might gather around, he supported the Malthouse Compromise. This emerged in January and involves the backstop being redrafted as a \"free trade agreement-lite\" with a commitment on all sides there should be no hard border on the island of Ireland. Would want to breathe new le into it. The DUP supports the compromise.Success Rating:  Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetJeremy HuntAlong with Johnson and Gove, considered one of the three most likely to win . He is of the view that the European Unions negotiating team has accepted that the backstop, or something very similar to the backstop, will not get through Parliament. But he hasnt set out an alternative to the backstop. Hard to knowhe hasnt actually got an alternative at this point, orhe is just keeping his powder dry until he gets to the final two.Success Rating:  Sajid Javid\"I will focus on the one Brexit deal that has already got through Parliament - that was the withdrawal agreement - with a change to the backstop. What I would do is make a grand gesture to Ireland that we would cover all their costs - the upfront costs, the running costs - of a new digitised border. I think it could be done in a couple of years.\" There is no evidence that he has even had below-the-radar discussions with either Ireland or the EU about his proposals.Success Rating:  Boris JohnsonNobody knows what Johnson will do. He excoriated the withdrawal agreement and the backstop at the DUPs conference last November and then voted for it a few weeks later. Has yet to explain how he will replace the backstop, let alone discuss avoiding the potential damage to UK Irish and North South relationshipshe fails to renegotiate the present agreement and the UK exits without a deal.Success Rating:  Andrea LeadsomHer parliamentary reputation has grown over the last two years, particularly while she was Leader of the House. More flexible than she is often given credit for, she speaks of a \"managed exit\" as opposed to a full-scale renegotiation and believes the backstop problem could be resolved with a \"sensible\" trade deal and \"technological oversight\" re the border.Success Rating:  Esther McVeyProbably the most hardline Brexiteer candidate and the one most likely to prioritise a no-deal over a renegotiation. Thats because she doesnt think the EU will reopen full-scale negotiations. The DUP wouldnt admit it, but itd rather she didnt win. The party talks tough on a no-deal outcome, but is well aware of the huge damage a no-deal could do to political institutional dynamics in Northern Ireland. Luckily for it, she has no chance.Success Rating:  Dominic RaabThe former Cabinet minister with \"responsibility for exiting the EU\" lasted only four months in the job: and didnt distinguish himself by his admission that he hadnt quite understood the full extent of how much UK trade relies on the Dover-Calais route. He also supported the Malthouse Compromise.Success Rating:  Rory StewartThe only genuine wildcard in the leadership race. His brutal, quirky honesty allows him to say things like \"stop pretending the EU will be willing to renegotiate the current backstop arrangement\". Would probably try and push the withdrawal agreement through after a new round of talks with the other parties. Would not be comfortable with a renewed parliamentary arrangement with the DUP.Success Rating:  "},{"url":null,"title":"civil service rapped as digital project cost doubles to","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Departmental officials expect that by October , total expenditure incurred will amount to £m - over twice the original contract value. Todays report also identied other weaknesses in DoFs management of the contract. It notes that, until September , the department was unable to provide details of total costs against inidual projects delivered through the contract, six years after it was established. Only four of the projects delivered through the contract reported that savings have been made, and these have yet to be veried.The report acknowledges that progress has been made in the digital transformation of public services, with  million digital transactions being completed across ious new services by March this year. However, the report criticised the way in which inidual projects delivered through the Strategic Partner Project were prioritised, with projects focused primarily on central government services rather than those most valued by the public, such as health.Auditor General Kieran Donnelly said: \"It is unacceptable that the Department of Finance did not have strong controls to monitor and manage spend through the NI Direct Strategic Partner Project. \"Lessons must be learnt and departments must put strong financial management controls in place and retain sufficient expert resources throughout the duration of major contracts.\"Digital transformation has the potential to signicantly reduce costs and improve experiences for citizens, and this report notes that some progress has been made.\"However, there is a long way to go before public services are fully citizen-focused and transformed. Achieving the full benefits of digital transformation must involve better collaboration and the development of truly transformational services that work across public sector organisations.\"Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann, a former chair of Stormonts Public Accounts Committee, said major change is urgently needed on how public money is managed in the Civil Service.\"There is a depressing familiarity about this in terms of yet another government project running wildly over budget and leaving the taxpayer to pick up the tab,\" he said.\"This comes at a time when the public is still awaiting the report of the RHI Inquiry which was a spectacular failure to manage public money, and this latest overspend will do nothing to restore public confidence in how public money is being managed and looked after.\"DoF said lessons are being learned from the Audit Office report.It insisted: \"The department is working closely with NIAO in response to the report and has taken action to improve delivery and enhance future digital transformation programmes. \"The departments audit and risk assurance committee conducted an in-depth review in October  to explore the financial and contractual position with the Strategic Partner Project. \"This review resulted in new arrangements being put in place to move existing services to new arrangements before the end of the current contract.

For years I was liaison with the Garda, and the truth is we weren’t treated very respectfully, we never got the policing we asked for and we were not protected.“I have no objection of members of the Garda taking part in a personal capacity, but we’ve forgotten what Pride is supposed to be about. It’s about resistance and solidarity, the fact that we will defend each other in good times and bad.“That’s what it commemorates, and there’s a recalibration needed.”The Pride alternative will take place at the same time as Dublin’s main parade on June .We are absolutely delighted to announce that the proposed route for the  #DublinPride Parade and March will see usto the very heart of our city! 🌈🌈🌈 The parade will assemble on Parnell Sq on Sat, June th and will end in Merrion Square with a free outdoor event. pic igpuFjftuo— Dublin LGBTQ PrideApril , An Garda Siochana announced in April that unormed gardai will take part in this year’s parade for the first time.Announced by Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan, the move was labelled “a signicant step that demonstrates An Garda Siochana’s commitment to building the inclusive Ireland”.Queer Action Ireland says the inclusion of gardai is an affront to the foundations of Pride.“The participation of gardai in unorm in this year’s parade is in direct opposition to the liberatory principles of Pride.“The police continue to target LGBTQ+ people, sex workers, migrant and other ethnic minority people in Ireland today. Just this week, gardai have arrested migrant sex workers on both sides of the country.“Cops marching in Pride is not a sign of progress, but rather a representation of the further co-optation of our struggle. While police will make concessions and recruit from our queer and migrant populations, their role remains the same.”Queer Action Ireland also says it cannot march alongside the festival’s media partner RTE: “A broadcaster who welcomed transphobic hate speech on to the air not months ago, and whose commitment to so-called ‘balanced’ reporting has led to the perpetuation of dangerous ideas and rhetoric around the island of Ireland, that endangers the lives of the queer community.”RTE director-general Dee Forbes said: “As Ireland’s national public media organisation, with a unique place in Ireland’s cultural landscape, we are proud to promote our vision to celebrate Ireland’s rich ersity by supporting the Dublin LGBTQ+ Pride Festival.”Pride celebrations worldwide have been criticised for over-commercialisation, with claims that large multinational corporations use the events as a marketing , without meaningful policy or advocacy behind their inclusion.“We cannot march in a parade that so readily welcomes corporations who see our community as no more than a marketing demographic,” Queer Action Ireland said.The Pride Alternative starts at pm on Rosie Hackett Bridge, and organisers say the event will be about “listening to each other, highlighting queer struggles, and drawing attention to the issues that face our community today”.Jed Dowling, director of Dublin LGBTQ Pride Festival, said: “Pride is always a mix of the personal and political.“No one owns Pride, nor should they. “We never want to tell anyone what it should mean to them or how they should express it. “Diversity and inclusion of all parts of our community is always welcome and never a bad thing.”Dublin’s Pride celebrations run from June  to ."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit and theresa may have inspired childrens creativity","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She was also the founder of the human rights organisation Participation and the Practice of Rights-a group that supported disadvantaged groups which she continued to advise until her death.Inez Murphy was born into the Protestant tradition in Cultra, County Down in September,  and after her initial studies won a position as a junior clerk in the Northern Ireland Civil Service at -years-old whilst working towards her A levels at night.At this tender age the budding champion of trade unionism didn’t fully appreciate what was actually happening in Northern Ireland and later recalled: “I was a puzzled young Prod. Until I was , I hadn’t knowingly met a Catholic. I was a young Protestant girl who didn’t understand that there were grave issues of inequality, injustice and ision in our society.”Inez McCormack’s first contact with Derry came in the years - when she attended Magee College. It was the era when the decision to locate Northern Ireland’s second university at Coleraine. The experience provided her with her first taste of ‘street politics’ and an initial glimpse at how power was abused. Between - she attended Trinity College in Dublin and it was there that she met Vincent McCormack.The pair married within three months of meeting and as her husband was a founding member of the Derry Labour Party, when they ed to Derry Inez had a first-hand insight of the growing Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. She was on the People’s Democracy march that was attacked at Burntollet by loyalists as it approached Derry in January,  and later described the era as “living through a historical defining moment.”Later in , having begun to study for a Diploma in Social Studies Inez McCormack began a career as a social worker in Ballymurphy, in . The West Belfast housing estate, ravaged by the Troubles also suffered great levels of social deprivation and in the midst of that an attempt was made to shut the Social Services office down and the workers were to be moved to a dferent area.Realising the need for them to stay the workers refused to leave Ballymurphy and they were advised to join a trade union to help them resist the pressure to go. Inez McCormack contacted the National Union of Public Employeesand all the workers were accepted as member with Inez acting as shop steward. By , she was working part-time for the union.NUPE would eventually become UNISON and in , Inez McCormack became the first female full-time official with the daunting task of achieving , members in the first five months of her employment.Realising that part-time women workers in the public sector were normally dismissed as ‘too dficult to organise’ and so weren’t part of a union, Inez McCormack began the process of signing them up.She said: “My whole mode of mobilising them was to make them see that their needs were real, that they were somebody.\"By the time UNISON was formed in  Inez had increased the union’s membership from  to ,. She went in to become the union’s first woman regional secretary and continued to represent low-paid women cleaners, home helps and nursing auxiliaries. Between - she was the first woman to chair the Northern Ireland committee of ICTU and became its first woman president in .Inez McCormack’s achievements were all the more remarkable coming as they did in a very male dominated world. But those achievements did not come lightly.\"At one meeting I was booed off the  and called scum. I was talking about child care and was told that it shouldnt be on a trade union agenda.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“To those \"inclined to take a stand against inequality or the abuse of human rights\", McCormack asserted that \"the fallout for the inidual can sometimes be brutal, but it is emphatically worth it,” she said.She was also a signatory to the MacBride Principles for fair employment, and succeeded in galvanising Irish-American opinion to combat the early unpopular reception to the Principles in Northern Ireland. The MacBride Principles were signed into US law in , and brought the power of US investment against the practice of religious discrimination in employment in the North.In the build-up to the  Belfast Agreement saw the adopted Derry woman running a brilliant campaign to have equality and human rights provisions included. Inez McCormack viewed this as being key to conflict resolution founded on the practice of justice.She saw that those most affected by violence in the North came from the most socially deprived communities. So, Inez McCormack’s campaign asserted the rights of the most socially excluded and she said: “Our job is to put the areas and people who are excluded at the centre of our economic and social planning and show that we can actually tackle the unjust and unstable conditions. I argue that a lot of the social problems come because the economy is built in a way that excludes people rather than includes.”The next landmark in Inez McCormack’s long list of achievements came in  when she set up participation and Practice of Rights . This is a Belfast group which supports marginalised groups in using a practical and unique human rights-based approach to tackle the social and economic challenges they experience. Successes include the establishment of a new appointment system for mental health patients attending emergency departments across Northern Ireland, re-housing families from run-down tower blocks, and renegotiation of regeneration plans from which residents have been excluded. Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, has described the work of the organisation as \"ground breaking,\" saying, \"They are not just challenging what is wrong, they are creating an inclusive sense of rights and dignity, they are engaged in pioneering work which will command much interest and application where.”McCormack was a founding member of the Vital Voices Global Advisory Council, and honoured in  at Vital Voices Global Leadership Awards in recognition of her contributions as a human rights advocate. The international organisation supports and invests in emerging women leaders in harnessing their potential to bring about peace and prosperity in their communities.She was also appointed in  by the Irish government as the independent chair of a consultative process to develop an Irish National Action Plan to meet government obligations under the UN Resolution on Women, Peace and Security.McCormack received numerous awards, including an honorary doctorate from Queens University Belfast in  for her services to human rights and the community. She received the Eleanor Roosevelt Award from New York City in , the Aisling Person of the Year Community Award in , and the Irish Tatler Women of the Year Award in .McCormack was also a well-known writer and broadcaster, and her work has been featured in a number of television programmes and documentaries. Numerous articles by McCormack on the theme of underpinning building peace and prosperity by inclusive socio-economic strategies have been published in recent years, and some of her work was included in the Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing .McCormacks career was featured in the  American documentary play Seven. The play, developed by Vital Voices, spotlights seven women from across the world that have overcame obstacles to bring major changes in their home countries. Meryl Streep portrayed McCormack. When the women portrayed were asked to come on stage and stand beside their onstage likenesses, Streep stated that she \"felt slight\" while standing beside McCormack, adding, \"Im an actress and she is the real deal.\"In , Newsweek named McCormack as one of its \" women who shake the world,\" the only Northern Irish woman to be named as such.The documentary, Inez McCormack: A Challenging Woman, produced and narrated by Susan McKay, won best short documentary award at the Galway Film Fleadh in .Inez McCormack had lived in Derry since . She passed away aged  in January  at the Foyle Hospice having fought bravely against cancer.

The Down defence was performing exceptionally well at this stage, but they had a nightmare finish to the first half.Despite defending in numbers, Down lost their shape and points from Josh Casey, Liam McGrath and Conor Sweeney sent Tipperary into the break with a - to - lead.Down now had the wind behind them in the second half and Havern reduced the arrears in the th minute with a point from play. This was quickly cancelled out with a free from McGrath before a Harrison point left two points between the sides.Havern and Sweeney exchanged scores before the mighty Quinn got involved.His influence on the game was immediate and an early point settled him into the pace of the game, his score leaving a point in it with  minutes remaining.Down fired a couple of wides before Burns produced his game-changing save. OrsquoHare seized the moment and he drilled the ball to the back of the net in the th minute after a bit of ping-pong in the Tipperary square.Down now had a - to - lead, but Liam Casey left the minimum in it yet again when he spilt the posts with a great score.Quinn and Quinlavin swapped scores before Quinn and Paul Devlin gave Down a - to - lead with only two minutes remaining.Conor Sweeney threw Tipperary a leline with a converted free, but with five additional minutes to be played, Down patiently held on to the ball and Barry OrsquoHagan completed the scoring when he restored his sidersquos three point lead in added time.Down: Rory Burns , Brendan McArdle, Darren OrsquoHagan , Gerard Collins, Ryan McAleenan, Kevin McKernan, Daniel Guinness, Johnny Flynn, Conor Poland, Conor Francis, Pat Havern , James Guinness, Jerome Johnston , Donal OrsquoHare , Connaire Harrison .

It is important we all work to strive for the very highest of standards across all our facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan bioblitz to locate identity of wildlife in forest park  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Park is the venue for a special race against the clock this weekend.Scientists, naturalists and members of the public will be taking part in a lsquobioblitzrsquo to find identy as many species as a possible over a period of  hours.The countdown begins on Friday at pm with a bat talk and nocturnal walk with the Northern Ireland Bat Group.On Saturday morning local moth expert Andy Crory will set out to discover what moths have been caught overnight.

An email sent to staff claimed the issue of period poverty was a lsquosilentrsquo issue that needed to be dealt with in a lsquodiscreetrsquo way by staff.Mrs Trainor said it was ldquoentirely unacceptable that women and girls were made to feel that their ldquotime of the month was inconvenient or shameful. Indeed, she said women and men have shied away from talking about periods openly for far too long.She added: ldquoUnite believes that, by changing perceptions, we can tackle some of the wider issues around periods. We want access to sanitary products in the workplace and schools to be as normal as having access to things such as toilet roll. Management of Newry, Mourne and Down Council need to change course and treat their female workforce with dignity.A council spokeswoman said the organisation was carrying out the lsquoPink Presentrsquo pilot scheme as a response to the increasingly recognised issue of lsquoperiod povertyrsquo within the wider community.ldquoWe are facilitating donations so that products are available to anybody who needs them, she said.ldquoThis project is being carried out in partnership with the Southern Health Trust and Southern Regional College and is an initiative which has previously been run in other parts of Northern Ireland, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoThere is currently limited data and statistical evidence on what the local need is for a period poverty project and this is what this pilot is trying to establish. We are very happy with how the scheme has been supported to date and will evaluate the scheme after the pilot has ended.The spokeswoman said the local authority was ldquocommitted to working with all its partners to deal with any health inequalities that are prevalent within the district and would continue to explore ways of helping those people in most need..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Crossgar girl Lauren’s charity sky dive  ","story":"CROSSGAR girl Lauren Houston is celebrating her th birthday next month with a thrilling sky e to raise money for Barnardorsquos.The charity is close to the teenrsquos heart as she knows from first hand experience what a helping hand can mean to a young person in care.Lauren was adopted at the age of four after being in the foster care system.The  year-old has already raised pound but hopes to raise more than her pound, target.A GCSE student at Saintfield High School, Lauren is also taking part in this weekendrsquos Aughlisnafin GAC Mud Run, near Castlewellan.Then a week after she turns , she will be doing a tandem skye on July .ldquoAs soon as Irsquom , I plan to do a sky e on my own, Lauren told the Down Recorder.ldquoI had to wait until I turned  before being allowed to do it due to age restrictions.

I think there was a bit more hunger from the Down team, especially in turning balls over and tackling. They showed a greater desire to win the game.Slowly, but surely Downrsquos players are starting to buy into Tallyrsquos revolution.Goalkeeper Rory Burns is a natural between the posts. He exudes confidence with his handling and his kick-outs are rarely wasted.The full back line of Darren OrsquoHagan, who negated the threat of former All Star Michael Quinlivan, the recalled Benny McArdle and Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins were immense.Kevin McKernan, Daniel Guinness and Ryan McAleenan threw a brick wall up in front of the back three and made scores extremely hard to come by for Tipperary.A fit again Jonny Flynn was a colossus in the middle of the park and more than held his own against the highly-rated Steven OrsquoBrien.Conor Polandrsquos physicality was much-needed in the engine room and Conor Francisrsquo non-stop running frustrated the le out of Tipperary.The Down forwards all kept going when forced to live off crumbs, but it was the introduction of Mayobridgersquos Cory Quinn that really caught the imagination.The  year-old forward has been the scourge of every defender on the county club scene since the start of the season and he is now starting to show that sort of form for Tally.The pocket rocket has pace, power and an eye for scores. Quinn has yet start to start a game for Down and throwing him in the deep end against a side like Mayo may not be fair on him, but Tally knows that he can spring him from the bench when required.The suspended Caolan Mooney will also be back for the Mayo game and he will relish the prospect of locking horns with Aiden OrsquoShea OrsquoShea, Keith Higgins, Matthew Ruane and Lee Keegan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Environment campaigner Isabel receives recognition  ","story":"A LOCAL environmental campaigner who has received a British Empire Medal in the Queenrsquos Birthday Honours says the award is ldquototally unexpected.Isabel Hood, who has been recognised for her services to environmental conservation, is vice-chairwoman of the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership and a trustee of the Mourne Heritage Trust.A keen sailor, she is a past commodore of Quoile Yacht Club and current chairperson of Portaferry Leboat Station.

The former police base is now in the ownership of the Department of Communities which is working alongside the local council to help bring new investment to the town.Details of the project have already attracted reported interest from leading retailers, with Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains understood to be keen to invest in Downpatrick. The proposed investment initiative also kills off plans for a new road through the former police base linking Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.Councillors were told this week that in addition to securing the necessary land in irish Street, officials also hope to make signicant progress on a development brief designed to encourage developers to come forward and redevelop the sprawling Irish Street site to provide a signicant economic boost for the town and existing traders through increased footfall.Securing world renowned UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty is also a priority for the local authority. The formal bud will be lodged this November.The focus on the so-called Two Oceans geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.For over one year the local authority has been engaging with local communities as it firms up its application bid and is working alongside the the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious designation for the local area is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with councillors confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.The thorny issue of car parking charges across the district is another key issue for the local authority which aims to rationalise the bye-laws controlling them.A detailed survey ordered in the wake of the controversial decision to hike car parking charges across the district last year has been completed.Charges at a number of car parks in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch were increased by % in April last year, rising to  pence per hour and increasing the cost of a weekly parking ticket to almost pound.But there is anger in the business community in both towns that while parking charges in their respective locations have been increased, it remains free to park at local authority-owned car parks in Newcastle, Saintfield and Castlewellan.Planning has been a particularly vexatious issue for the local council since it was handed responsibility for it, with many councillors particularly happy with its current delivery.Under the draft development plan, the local authority aims, by the end of March next year, to process % of local planning applications with  weeks. A turnaround target of processing % of major application within  weeks has been set.Dealing with a backlog of enforcement issues has also been a problem for local planners with the council aiming to conclude % of enforcement cases within  weeks..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Karen is a golden girl  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother has just ed home from the World Classic Powerlting Championships in Sweden with a haul of medals.The  year-old legal secretary won gold in the deadlt where she raised kg.

highly ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in the resort.The ious proposals are at the heart of the Mournes Gateway investment initiative which is one of a series of projects included in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector who have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.Earlier this year, a so-called heads of agreement mdash paving the way for work to start on the business cases and financial plans for ious components of the city deal mdash was signed.On Monday, members of the local councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee were provided with a progress report, with other key issues the council keen to see delivered as part of the city deal initiative including the southern relief road linking Newry by-pass with the Warrenpoint Road and the multi-million pound regeneration of Newry town centre.Local authority officials are expected to work with Tourism NI to help deliver the ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle which include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes.The proposal is one of a series of exciting, world class attraction proposals, including an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It is being suggested that work on the business case, alongside detailed financial plans, could take around one year to complete, with the ious proposals delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.While the main focus is on the major aspects of the tourism initiative mdash which also include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy and an indoor activity centre in Donard Park mdash there are many other components.The local council hopes to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre.In addition, local authority officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the gateway project and to move its ious components through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.The Mournes Gateway project also includes an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Various aspects of the Newcastle tourism plan have already been discussed with the National Trust, Forest Service and Environment Agency, with the overarching vision of the project to provide game-changing, world-class, international tourist attractions..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Pop up beach plan aims to boost tourism  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has unveiled details of a three-pronged initiative designed to enhance Newcastlersquos tourist reputation and satisfy the needs of residents and visitors left disappointed and frustrated at the absence of sand along its beach.The local authority is planning to work alongside the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs as part of the initiative with politicians told on Monday that plans are being drawn up to hold a meeting involving councillors, council officials and government representatives.The government department needs to grant a marine licence to carry out work at the beach, with the forthcoming talks also due to discuss the potential for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to the beach at Newcastle promenade.However, many believe that such a costly operation would simply not be feasible as the sand would be washed out to sea in a very short period of time and that such a scheme may not be approved by government officials.Details of the new Newcastle initiative were outlined at Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee when councillors agreed to start work on an economic appraisal to help improve the beach.It will examine in detail the cost and merits of a radical suggestion to add an articial pop-up beach at the resortrsquos promenade to provide the town with a certain je ne sais quoi between July and August.The idea to bring a little European flair to the resortrsquos sea front via a pop-up-beach mdash similar to those along the banks of the Seine in Paris and other parts of Europe mdashwas first suggested last year.While the idea was initially rejected by a council committee, the recommendation was subsequently overturned by the full council, with officers asked to look at the issue of how to address Newcastlersquos shting sands to make the resort more appealing.The problem is exacerbated by the design of the promenade which deflects waves back out to sea, taking what little sand there is on sections of the beach with it.Politicians insist that they are keen to make the resort even more attractive to visitors, often left disappointed there is no sand where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea.They say they recognise that the absence of a sandy beach is the resortrsquos Achilles heel and is an issue they are keen to address to make Newcastle even more attractive to holidaymakers in particular.Politicians also want more focus on an enhanced beach management plan which will result in a more robust cleansing programme alongside the provision of additional litter bins.Pop-up beaches along the banks of the Seine and in other parts of Europe are hugely popular and a final decision on whether they could feature in Newcastle next summer with deck chairs and parasols the order of the day along a section of the picturesque promenade is expected to be taken within the next weeks.While local politicians are united on the need to address Newcastlersquos tourism needs, they are split on the merits of a pop-up beach, with a number for and opposed to such a move, arguing there is no appetite for such a facility in the resort.In addition, some council officials believe that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be and that the cost over a nine-week summer period would be in the region of pound,.Some councillors have also suggested that consideration needs to be given to placing groins along sections of beach to protect what little sand there is on it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9410781.jpg","title":"dragons den pitch for swcs business students","story":"Final year business students from South

A no confidence motion would have to be tabled with  daysrsquo notice.It is understood the saga around the transfer of Llancarfan Primary School to Rhoose, described by many as a ldquoclosure, was a driving factor behind Conservatives calling for Cllr Thomasrsquo departure.Cllr Thomasrsquo cabinet approved the controversial move despite opposition from parents and campaigners and criticism from one cabinet member, Councillor Gordon Kemp.Cllr Kemp was eventually sacked from the cabinet after joining  Conservative councillors who abstained on voting for the administrationrsquos budget.The LDRS is also aware of ldquoserious discontent from several of Cllr Thomasrsquo backbenchers over a number of ldquoPR blunders, including proposed car parking charges throughout the Vale.Cllr Bailey, who is the current chairman of the councilrsquos environment and regeneration scrutiny committee, has been on the authority since the  after gaining the Dyfan ward in Barry for the Conservatives from Labour.Cllr Bailey said:ldquoI would firstly like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to John Thomas, who has worked exceptionally hard for the Vale of Glamorgan during his time as leader of the council and the Conservative Group.ldquoI would like to thank him for all of his help and support, I look forward to working with him and other colleagues as we move forward.ldquoThe Vale is a fantastic place, and fellow councillors and I look forward to delivering a bright and prosperous future for all our residents.ldquoIt is a huge honour to have been elected group leader, following a vote at the annual general meeting of the Conservative Group.ldquoThe council and its employees exist to serve local people, and moving forward our priorities must include delivering progress on the Dinas Powys By-Pass, revisiting decisions to introduce car parking charges and close Llancarfan School, and looking again at the options to improve transport links between the A and J of the M.Cllr Thomas was elected to represent the St Athan ward in , and has been leader of the authority since May .A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoCllr John Thomas continues to be leader of the Vale of Glamorgan CouncilldquoThere has been one change to the councilrsquos political executive.

The councilrsquos cabinet remains otherwise unchanged.ldquoThe meeting of full council on May  will go ahead as planned.ldquoHowever, the resignation of two members of the Conservative group has caused the postponement of the councilrsquos annual general meeting scheduled for May .ldquoAt the AGM there is a discussion around the allocation of committee seats and chairmanships of committees.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Like last year, it is understood that survivors and the bereaved will not do interviews on the day of the anniversary.Yvette Williams, a co-ordinator of campaign group Justice  Grenfell, said there was an atmosphere of heaviness in the community following a series of setbacks, including the public inquiryrsquos first report being delayed and the news that any criminal charges will come after the probe has concluded.People are ldquoincreasingly feeling a sense of injustice, rather than a walk to justice, she said. -- --She told the Press Association: ldquoFor us the anniversary is always focused on the .

Renewed weakness was evident within services, retail and construction. All three of these sectors signalled a signicant decline in activity in April.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mannnn.jpg","title":"manufacturing is ni bucking the global slowdown","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Global manufacturing and industry stalwarts such as Germany are feeling the slowdown. So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG.

John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential.

Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
