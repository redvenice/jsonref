Billionaire tycoon Stephen Ross\u0027 many companies include Equinox and SoulCycle         Various celebrities have cited the fundraiser and announced boycotts of SoulCycle and EquinoxAll this is part of a wider, deeply sinister theme about the hard millennial left that suggests they feel entitled to shame and abuse anyone who supports Trump.A few days ago, Democrat congressman Rep. Joaquin Castro from Texas named and shamed 44 Trump donors in his state, accusing them of ‘fuelling a campaign of hate’.By doing so, and including the names of all their firms, he wanted these people punished, professionally and personally.He made them targets for abuse, and possibly violence.When news broke that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, 77, had broken his shoulder in a fall on Sunday night, enraged liberal protestors raced to his home in Kentucky to scream ‘F*ck you, f*ck your wife, f*ck everything you stand for!’They proudly broadcast their actions on Facebook Live.We’ve seen female White House officials like Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders horribly abused, physically assaulted, and thrown out of restaurants.Yet the people doing all this vile stuff are the same people who profess to hate Trump because he is so ‘intolerant’.The truth is that there is nothing more intolerant than the modern American hard millennial left as represented by the likes of Chrissy Teigen.They furiously preach ‘compassion, empathy and humanity’ yet have none themselves.And their own moral self-righteousness is of coursed riddled with rank hypocrisy.Ms Teigen and her celebrity friends all enthusiastically supported Barack Obama in fundraisers despite the fact he deported 3 million immigrants, broke all US presidential records for dropping bombs, and kept illegal torture center Guantanamo Bay open throughout his presidency despite making its closure a key campaign pledge in 2008.I have no problem with Chrissy Teigen cancelling her accounts with Equinox and SoulCycle.In fact, I’m delighted that this will now reduce the chance of me finding myself accidentally stationed next to her irritating little PC-crazed face on a spinning bike.But I do have a big problem with her and her multi-millionaire celebrity pals trying to destroy the jobs of so many hard-working young people working at these gyms just because she doesn’t agree with the political views of a man who owns the parent company.It’s a new kind of fascism, and it’s disgusting."},{"url":null,"title":"Fascinating pictures offer glimpse inside Soho jazz club 1950s","story":"Share this article The proprietor of the club, Gustavus Alexander Leslie, filed for bankruptcy in December 1959.\u0027Even if you\u0027d never met a Jamaican or an African, you got together in London,\u0027 said Russ Henderson.\u0027And Soho was the place in those days, particularly the Sunset Club in Carnaby Street, where jazz played until seven in the morning.\u0027That was where the musicians went when the other clubs closed: West Indians and Africans along with the Chris Barbers and the Humphrey Lyttletons.

We haven\u0027t heard of a single young woman,\u0027 says Martin) who have taken their own lives.Also appearing are Liz and Charles Ritchie, from Sheffield, who lost their son in strikingly similar circumstances. Jack — proud recipient of a 2:1 degree, avid sportsfan, a life-and-soul-of-the-party type — took his life in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi where he was teaching English.The Ritchies founded charity Gambling With Lives when they lost Jack. It is now in contact with 45 other families, which they reckon is \u0027the tip of the iceberg\u0027.The Ritchies have launched a legal bid to hold the Government to account for their son\u0027s death.They want an \u0027Article 2\u0027 inquest into Jack\u0027s death. These are usually held (under Article 2 of the European Convention On Human Rights) when the state has failed to protect the deceased from risk. So, what does this have to do with Wayne Rooney?Nothing, and yet everything, says Charles Ritchie. \u0027I mean I do think Rooney\u0027s decision has been extraordinary, not least because he\u0027s had his own gambling issues in the past. At least I hope they are in the past. But I don\u0027t want to single Rooney out because so many of them are at it.\u0027The problem is the bigger picture. This \u0027normalisation\u0027 of the online gambling industry through football is dangerous. The law is supposed to protect children, but every eight-year-old in the country now knows the names of all these gambling companies. It\u0027s grooming, pure and simple, clever grooming.\u0027          Dr Alan Smith, the Bishop of St Albans, told the Mail yesterday that the England legend should make decisions in the interests of his fans \u0027and not his bank balance\u0027Sadly, since Jack died, they have discovered more about gambling than they thought they needed to know. Liz, who is a psychotherapist, talks about the effect on the brain. \u0027It\u0027s like any other addiction. It\u0027s physical. Once these youngsters — and they are youngsters all our boys started gambling as children or in their teens — are hooked, they are powerless to get out.\u0027Yet the gambling industry sends out the message that it is their responsibility to walk away if they have a problem. They say \u0027when the fun stops, stop\u0027. It\u0027s a million miles from fun. And when boys like Jack can\u0027t stop, they are told it\u0027s their fault, it\u0027s a weakness in them, they are somehow morally lacking or flawed, or less manly than they should be. That\u0027s what kills them.\u0027Of particular concern, says Charles, is the drive, now supported by celebrities, to promote gambling as a sport in its own right — \u0027the message being \u0027are you competitive enough, or talented enough to be a winner too?\u0027 \u0027It is striking that all these families seem to have witnessed gambling that started in the teens. Sports gambling too.\u0027Some of the boys made it into their 30s, but most didn\u0027t,\u0027 says Liz. But young men have always gambled, haven\u0027t they?Not like this, says Charles. \u0027A generation ago, you had to go into a bookies. Gambling was seen as a vice. Now, it\u0027s portrayed as a sport in itself — or they want you to believe that. Now every youngster has a casino in his pocket.\u0027It is the pace of play in many modern gambling apps that is potentially destructive. Academics will tell you very few people develop a gambling problem with, say, the National Lottery, because the frequency of the draws limits play.Today\u0027s all-singing-all-dancing websites and apps — with their bright colours, and flashing icons are very different. On 32Red, new users are promised a £10 deposit on signing up. In the casino version they can play classic table games and poker.There are also special games based on familiar TV shows such as Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? On the sporting version of 32Red, members can bet on everything from Premier League football to surfing and WWE wrestling.Dr Mark Griffiths, Professor of Behavioural Addiction at Nottingham Trent University, has spent 32 years studying addictions, advising the Government and some of the big gambling companies.He says it\u0027s not just the speed of transactions that is being pushed, but the idea that players are somehow in control. \u0027Every single gambling company is embracing the innovation. The apps that used to be basic now offer everything — accumulator bets, boosting odds. The biggest change is in in-play betting. It\u0027s all about making the gambler feel they are in control, that they have knowledge, expertise. Some people liken it to speculating on the stock market, with some knowledge.\u0027Much is made of the legal responsibilities the gambling industry already have. All the big firmspoint out that they exclude \u0027problem gamblers\u0027 and all offer immediate self-exclusion.They don\u0027t do nearly enough, say the families. Most of their sons self-excluded from multiple sites, but still managed to keep gambling.Dr Griffiths — who as far back as 1996 was predicting the online gambling world was going to change the face of the industry — makes much of the fact that he likes to gamble.\u0027I like roulette. I will have a gamble when I am watching football, because it makes the outcome more exciting.\u0027But when I play a slot machine, I call it research. I\u0027m not anti-gambling by any means.\u0027He is, however, anti adolescent gambling, which is where the problem lies.He has teenage children — or \u0027screenagers\u0027 as he calls them, a nod to the reality of youngsters living their lives on phones or tablets. \u0027My boys are football mad. One of them idolises Wayne Rooney. He has a photograph with him on his Facebook page.\u0027Am I happy with Rooney having the number 32 on his back? No I am not, because it takes us into a very grey area, and I say that both as a father and as someone who has written two books on adolescent gambling.\u0027As the law stands, you can\u0027t advertise gambling to children. But you can\u0027t put that number on Rooney\u0027s back without sending a message to children.\u0027Wayne Rooney declined to comment when approached by the Mail. He isn\u0027t the first celebrity to be accused of failing his young fans.In 2016, Ant and Dec signed a three-year deal with 32Red which involved their faces being used in an online game.Jack Ritchie\u0027s mum warns that we shouldn\u0027t just be worrying about 16 and 17-year-olds trying to sneak an underage bet when every eight-year-old footie fan now knows their Dafabet from their 32Red.\u0027It\u0027s vile that they even know these names. What terrifies me is how quickly it is all going.\u0027Our boys all started gambling on laptops and desktop PCs, then they progressed to smartphones.\u0027Today\u0027s kids — tomorrow\u0027s gamblers — are going to go straight to the smartphones first. They are going to gamble faster, and more furiously, and some of them are going to get into trouble at a much earlier age and some of them will die, maybe at a younger age than our boys too.

Details were scarce in the announcement, but Sharon Tal Yguado, Amazon’s head of scripted programming, then promised “a new epic journey in Middle-earth”.Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey, who is supervising the show’s development, told German fansite Deutsche Tolkien that the estate has refused to allow the series to be set during any period other than the Second Age of Middle-earth. This means Amazon’s adaptation will not cross over at all with events from the Third Age, which were dramatised in Peter Jackson’s Oscar-winning trilogy and sees hobbit Frodo Baggins destroy the One Ring.Spanning 3,441 years, the Second Age begins after the banishment of the dark lord Morgoth and ends with the first demise of Sauron, Morgoth’s servant and the primary villain in The Lord of the Rings, at the hands of an alliance of elves and men.Shippey said that Amazon “has a relatively free hand” to add details since Tolkien did not flesh out every detail of the Second Age in his appendices or Unfinished Tales, a collection of stories published posthumously in 1980. But Shippey called it “a bit of a minefield – you have to tread very carefully”, saying that “the Tolkien estate will insist that the main shape of the Second Age is not altered. Sauron invades Eriador, is forced back by a Númenórean expedition, is returns to Númenor. There he corrupts the Númenóreans and seduces them to break the ban of the Valar. All this, the course of history, must remain the same.“But you can add new characters and ask a lot of questions, like: What has Sauron done in the meantime? Where was he after Morgoth was defeated? Theoretically, Amazon can answer these questions by inventing the answers, since Tolkien did not describe it. But it must not contradict anything which Tolkien did say. That’s what Amazon has to watch out for. It must be canonical, it is impossible to change the boundaries which Tolkien has created. It is necessary to remain ‘Tolkienian’.”Contacted by the , the Tolkien estate declined to confirm or deny Shippey’s claim.Amazon’s Lord of the Rings series is predicted to start production in 2020. An official release date has yet to be announced, but Shippey revealed that it would  22 episodes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17701932c418a945838a034622725425905b038e/0_290_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9287db263ff21801971cf020a52d4b2a","title":"does a man have the right to write about metoo author david leser thinks so","story":"When the male journalist became one of the first authors commissioned to write a book about a women’s movement, controversy ensuedIt was December 2017 and, like most of the world, veteran Sydney journalist David Leser was transfixed by the millions of women speaking out about sexual assault as part of the MeToo movement.“It was the biggest social movement of my lifetime,” Leser tells  Australia.Around the same time, the 63-year-old was asked by the editor of Nine’s Good Weekend to write for the magazine.“I said, ‘The only story I’m interested in writing is the Harvey Weinstein story.’ That, to me, was the biggest story in the world,” he says.Duly commissioned, Leser says the Good Weekend article – titled Men, Women and the Whole Damn Thing – started with the central question: “Could a man – should a man – do this story?”For some, the answer was yes. After all, the story of women’s oppression can’t be told without examining men’s role as oppressors. But, for others, the thought that a man might be writing about women’s pain, and might be offered significant platforms for his thoughts, was mansplaining in extremis – especially when the Good Weekend cover story was followed by a book deal.In the Australian, columnist Nikki Gemmell wrote: “It seems, uncomfortably, that men feel the need to colonise this courageous, fraught, intensely female #MeToo moment. And of course they’re enabled they always are. Men power through, drowning out our voices they endure, cling on, mansplain to us.”Van Badham told the ’s Amanda Meade: “This is precisely the structural sexism that MeToo has illuminated, and we’re staring at it, and it’s so very ugly.”Elsewhere on feminist forums and social media, Australian women were incensed that the long-awaited moment of reckoning via the MeToo movement would be filtered through a male lens.Leser speaks to  Australia at the Byron Bay writers’ festival, where he is launching his book, also called Women, Men and the Whole Damn Thing.“It’s incumbent on men to know why men are doing this and to talk about it and to examine the models of manhood we’ve been given, so that we understand it.”Leser sees his book as extending the MeToo conversation “by asking what is it in men that has created so much pervasive violence – and not just against women but against other men and against themselves.”The book itself is almost two in one: an examination of the MeToo movement (less an analysis, more of a recap of the major events and key players in the months after October 2017) and an exploration of the dark side of masculinity.But a common theme throughout is misogyny. Leser argues that it wasn’t always this way that once, “before the great creation legend of Genesis, before the myths of ancient Greece”, where “the feminine was venerated”, there were female healers, priestesses, lawmakers and warriors. It was only with time and “newer religions” Christianity, Judaism and Islam, he says, that misogyny was seeded.Leser also discusses ways in which he believes men turn misogyny in on themselves. “As boys we quickly learn that these qualities we might loosely call feminine – tenderness, gentleness, vulnerability – are devalued and they are shamed, and they are repressed and often they are removed.“And what do we say to boys? Don’t be weak, don’t be a sissy, don’t cry. Boys learn when they are young to remove those parts of themselves that are part of their emotional range.”Leser believes that this moment is particularly potent because the misogyny that has “coursed its way through history to the present day” is now butting up against the “unstoppable rise of women”. He points to women in leadership positions, on company boards and in the corporate world as evidence of this unstoppable rise.But is women’s ascent really as linear and uncomplicated as that? For all of the gains women have made – and they have been significant – there is the sense that things have stalled or in some cases gone backwards. Just ask a women outside the white, heterosexual mainstream how difficult it is to gain access to power, let alone find justice for those wrongs that are done to them.Leser’s book contains interviews with second-wave feminists such as Helen Garner, traversing the so-called grey zones of sexual assault – ground that would be familiar to readers of The First Stone. It highlights, again, the political isions between younger and older feminists.“Some young people tend to think of themselves as a bubble of rights moving around the world and they’re in this little shining enclosure and that’s their rights,” Garner says in the book. “It’s like someone with road rage: anyone bumps against them and they go berko.”Meanwhile, the voices of younger feminists and intersectional perspectives are largely absent.“The book should have been called Women, Men, The Whole Damn Thing Minus All the Things I Couldn’t Talk About,” Leser says.“I was given five months to write this book. So there will be many things that readers will think should have been in the book or should not have been in the book. I could have spent months in Indigenous communities with the most at-risk women in this country. I could have spent months looking at the whole transgender LGBTQI community. I didn’t – I didn’t have time. I did what I could.”So is this book written for men or women? Leser doesn’t answer the question directly.“The act of writing is the act of understanding,” he says. “But you have to write without looking over your shoulder or anticipating your audience because it’s a terrifying and humbling task to write about something as fraught and complex as this.”After getting the book contract, Leser interviewed people from around the world who are invested in the movement, such as former New Yorker editor Tina Brown French secretary of equality Marlène Schiappa and masculinity expert Michael Kimmel. Some of his interviewees had experienced abuse, some were accused of abuse, and some had devoted their lives to trying to make things better between the sexes.“Writing this book reduced me to tears,” Leser says. “I was made privy to so much pain but there were times when I felt immobilised by that and I didn’t think I could do it.”Which privileges have you given up, I ask Leser.He talks about his 23-year marriage to a feminist woman, now over. “I thought I was a progressive male. Actually, my work was more important. My projects were more important. My ambitions were more important and my needs were more important. And that’s one of the reasons why my marriage foundered.“And it’s too late to do anything about that now ... I would never make that mistake again. I would try and bed down a reciprocity and a respect and a mutual regard for each other’s lives and careers. When you see you are much further from where you might have been, it’s a very sobering thing.”• Women, Men and the Whole Damn Thing by David Leser is out now through Allen and Unwin"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc73cfedc33de8b14cb08ad3730ce701c4f656d7/0_701_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d583f7f61e38c17f6562fdd6fe4d9606","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.“It’s Mark Twain these days,” says voicefrombelgrade, “I’m rereading his short story collection”:Every time I read The Experience Of The McWilliamses With Membranous Croup, Extracts from Adam’s Diary, Eve’s Diary, The Stolen White Elephant... I just love them. Also, I pilfered Tom Sawyer from my late father’s library (all right, I’ll take it back, my mom won’t even know that I took it...) – it’s a masterful Serbian translation from the 1949 (the author is Stanislav Vinaver). It’s relatively rare to find a translation that’s as good as the original, but this one really is, and I just have to revisit it every so often.BaddHamster is “finishing up” The House Of Sleep by Jonathan Coe:Warm, funny, breezily paced (as always with him) and a few interesting thoughts on the nature of sleep. Basically, if you like Coe, you’ll probably enjoy it. I do and I am.And CharlieBing “just finished” Judith Schalansky’s Pocket Atlas of Remote Islands:As a cartographer by training and a sometime graphic artist by trade, I just loved almost every bit of this beautifully designed book ... a minor quibble with the occasional use of yellow text on white pages, but the typography is exquisite, the whole conceit just wonderful.Michael, a retired headmaster grieving for his wife, the victim of a terrorist attack, asks himself the question of who is really responsible for what happened, not the bombers themselves, not the bomb makers, but the ‘bomb-triggerers’ – the politician enriching himself from his time in office. There’s much more to this story than vengeance though the narration soon reveals darker aspects of Michael’s character as he recalls his career. Good’s skill is in the narrator considering himself as a realist struggling with difficult pupils, but coming over to the reader as anything but that, and a cruel authoritarian.As an ex-teacher of 31 years, this is an admirably accurate portrayal of some headteacher’s traits I have seen all too frequently.Reading Isabel Allende’s Daughter Of Fortune has been “an exquisite pleasure” for PatLux:Such a rich historical novel in which I, like one of the main protagonists Tao Chi’en, learned lots. I loved the lyrical evocative prose which stimulated all my senses. One of those books that makes you feel you are on a delightful journey with the characters and evokes laughter and sadness. And it stays with you in the intervals between when you put it down and pick it up again. I will definitely be reading more Allende.MachenBach recommends Augustus Carp, Esq., By Himself: Being the Autobiography of a Really Good Man:A satirical mock-autobiography, published anonymously by Sir Henry Howarth Bashford in 1924. Anthony Burgess singled it out as one of the 20th century’s funniest books, but I would say that it’s consistently amusing, rather than LOL funny. Still, that’s rare enough to be noteworthy. Carp is possessed of a Pooterishly inflated sense of his own (and his father’s) importance, and almost total blindness to his own limitations and motivations. He’s a hilariously sanctimonious self-professed Christian (or “Xtian”), who frequently goes out into the streets to lecture smokers, drinkers and music hall artistes on the evils of their ways, but who seems hypocritically blind to his own acts of bullying, blackmail, and greed. Like a monstrous cross between Pooter and Ignatius J Reilly, his voice is impressively realised, and the irony well sustained. I’m not sure how much real satirical bite it had at the time – it seems rather more 1890s than 1920s in many ways, and the joke does wear a little thin long before he gets his comeuppance, but it’s very well-written (in a pretentiously archaic register) and generally good fun.Finally, Dennis89 suggests we give “serious thought” to reading An Armenian Sketchbook by Vasily Grossman:A 200-page account detailing the writer’s reflections, thoughts and wanderings during his visit to Armenia at the twilight of his life. Justification for the journey is provided by the task of editing a Russian translation of a local Armenian novel though the trip allows Grossman to explore and delve far more deeply into this marginalised and often overlooked country.Faith, patriotism, oppression, comradeship and other such topics are beautifully mused upon in this life-affirming gem of a book.Sounds fantastic. (That’s also an excellent excuse to link to Linda Grant’s fine article on reading Grossman: “It took me three weeks to read it and three weeks to recover from the experience.”)If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

An announcement that Ataer has won preferred bidder status could be made by the government’s official receiver David Chapman and EY, which is managing the sale, as early as next week.Ataer is believed to be the frontrunner after it committed to keeping all parts of the steel company together. While the plant in Scunthorpe makes up the vast majority of British Steel’s operations, the government has so far expressed a preference for selling the company as a single entity, including satellite operations in areas such as Teesside.When Greybull Capital bought British Steel in 2016 it promised great things. The private equity firm pledged to invest £400m and within months it was boasting of a\u0026nbspreturn to profit and a bright future ahead. Two years later it appears to be on the brink of collapse unless it receives a government-funded bailout. In a letter to staff last week, the British Steel chief executive blamed weak market demand, high raw material prices, the weakness of sterling and uncertainty over the outcome of Brexit discussions.It is not the only factor in the crisis but it is very important. Steel contracts are typically agreed well in advance of the product being delivered. As things stand, the UK is\u0026nbspdue to leave the EU on 31 October\u0026nbspand the terms of that separation are\u0026nbspyet to be agreed, meaning British Steel’s overseas customers don’t know what tariffs will apply to steel they buy from the company. Sources close to the company say orders from customers in the EU and further afield have dried up as a result.The steelworks in Scunthorpe represents the bulk of the company and it is hard to see who would be an obvious buyer for the site, given that it has struggled under successive owners. The fundamental problems affecting it show no sign of solution any time soon.The UK steel industry has been in decline for some time due to a variety of factors such as overcapacity in EU steelmaking and Chinese state-subsidised firms flooding the global market with cheap product. An industry that employed 323,000 people in 1971 now employs less than a tenth of that, at 31,900. The closure of the\u0026nbspRedcar steelworks in 2015\u0026nbspwas a significant blow to the sector and left the UK with just two blast furnace steelworks: Scunthorpe and Tata Steel-owned Port Talbot in south Wales.The government has already provided a £120m loan to British Steel to help meet its obligations under an EU carbon credits scheme for industrial polluters. Nevertheless, the firm is understood to be losing £5m a week. has approached EY and BEIS for comment.Earlier this week, BEIS said: “This government will leave no stone unturned to get a good solution for British Steel at Scunthorpe, Skinningrove and on Teesside.”If discussions with Ataer break down, three bidders are waiting in the wings: Liberty House, led by Indian-born metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta Greybull Capital, the investment group which owned British Steel when it collapsed and the west African consortium led by an as-yet unnamed civil engineering firm.While not revealing its identity, the firm said it would not require any government assistance or grants, unlike some of the rival bids.“The consortium is working on a long-term massive infrastructure project in west Africa,” said a source close to the company, which has masked its identity. “The successful purchase of the Scunthorpe site would mean an export opportunity of steel to this project – with immediate effect.“The project has an estimated 10-year delivery timescale and has multiple related additional export opportunities for British steel to the region.”Oyak pension fund’s experience in the steel industry stems from its shareholding in the Turkish steelmaker Erdemir.Liberty House would prefer to convert the Scunthorpe works from a blast furnace plant, which makes steel from scratch. It seeks government loan guarantees to replace the blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces, which would be used to make products by recycling scrap steel.Greybull Capital is understood to be interested in picking up parts of the business if the government’s preference for selling the whole business fails to materialise. In that case, the Scunthorpe steelworks would be likely to close for good.The Turkish fund has offered to invest between £60m and £70m to take control of British Steel, according to sources.Insiders told Sky News the funding would satisfy EU state aid rules, which Theresa May’s administration claimed prevented ministers from providing support to British Steel before it collapsed into insolvency in May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b1bd97faf14d0bd621041876070ca2507c741ee/0_149_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ed5fb7ada851f597d201c3e1c2fde2f","title":"reality tv star kylie jenner celebrates birthday on 1m a week superyacht","story":"Cosmetics billionaire and reality TV star boarded vessel in Italy for 22nd birthdayKylie Jenner, the Keeping up with the Kardashians reality TV star whose eponymous cosmetics empire has turned her into the world’s youngest billionaire, will this weekend spend more than £1m on a party to celebrate her 22nd birthday onboard a $126m (£104m) superyacht.Jenner has chartered the 91.5m (300ft) yacht Tranquility, which features a swimming pool, jacuzzi, sauna, Turkish bath, an “experiential shower”, a cinema and helicopter landing pad, to party in the Mediterranean this weekend.Jenner, who has 143 million followers on Instagram, built her business on $29 Kylie Lip Kits, which promise “the perfect pout”.She arrived in Italy in usual billionaire style, flying in from Los Angeles by private jet before boarding the Tranquility from the picturesque village of Positano on Thursday.The yacht, the world’s 71st-largest, is described on its website as “the ultimate blend of luxury living and indulgent relaxation”. It costs €1.1m-a-week – “plus expenses” – to charter and has up to 29 crew to sail the boat and cater to the guests.Kylie’s contingent includes her rapper and music producer boyfriend, Travis Scott, 18-month-old daughter Stormi, her mother and “momager” Kris, and friends including the Hollywood actor Scott Disick and model Sofia Richie. The vessel quickly headed off to the exclusive island of Capri.As well as hosting an extravagant party for her birthday on Saturday, Jenner will also be launching a new product for the cosmetics empire, this time a “must-have” body powder..The party yacht, which was named yacht of the year at the World Superyacht Awards in 2014, was previously owned by Jho Low, a fugitive billionaire.Low is wanted by Malaysian and US authorities in connection with the 1MDB sovereign wealth fund scandal. He is accused of using money from the Malaysian fund to buy a private jet, artworks by Van Gogh and Monet, homes in London, New York and California, and a rare 22-carat pink diamond necklace valued at $27.3m. He also helped finance Hollywood blockbuster, The Wolf of Wall Street, starring Leonardo DiCaprio.Low denies all the charges, but his whereabouts are currently unknown.Malaysian authorities seized the yacht, which it claims Low bought with $250m of stolen government funds, last year and sold it to the casino operator Genting Malaysia for $126m. Genting is chartering out the yacht, previously called Equanimity, via British broker Camper \u0026amp Nicholsons.The broker describes the boat, fitted out by the billionaire’s designer of choice, Britain’s Andrew Winch, as “iconic” and “truly exceptional”.Scott started the celebrations for Jenner’s birthday earlier this week by covering the hallway of her LA mansion in thousands of rose petals, and left a card saying “we’re just getting started. Happy Birthday.”In an Instagram caption she wrote: “This man covered my house in roses omg!” while his song “Wake up” from his album Astroworld played.It is thought that Jenner’s birthday plans have been masterminded by wedding and party planning consultant Mindy Weiss, who has arranged other over-the-top celebrations for Jenner, including Stormi’s first birthday party. The event – christened StormiWorld – involved creating a whole theme park, which guests entered through a giant inflatable head of Stormi before walking through a corridor of fake clouds and rain – an apparent “storm”.Stormi’s first birthday presents included a Chanel purse, given to her by Jenner’s chum DJ Khaled. In a video, filmed by Jenner, her mum is heard to say: “Oh Stormi! Your first Chanel.”Weiss also arranged Kris Jenner’s Gatsby-themed 60th birthday in 2015, an Alice in Wonderland-themed first birthday for Chicago West (the daughter of Kanye West and Kim Kardashian), and Kylie Jenner’s 21st birthday.She said arranging parties for the Kardashians was the favourite part of her job. “They’re all very creative. We’re so excited every time we get called to do one because they have their own ideas,” she told W magazine earlier this year. “Kanye being the most creative. He’s so visual and steps out of the box and he really inspires me, and he inspires the whole family.”Jenner is not the only billionaire sailing around the Med on a superyacht this summer. American billionaire media executive David Geffen has been posting regular updates on his holiday with a string of other other billionaires.Partying this week with Geffen on his $590m superyacht Rising Sun, sailing around Ibiza and the Balearics are Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, his new girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez, former Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein, venture capitalist Joshua Kushner and his supermodel wife, Karlie Kloss, and oil heir Mikey Hess.A week earlier Geffen hosted Oprah Winfrey, and in July Orlando Bloom and Katy Perry popped aboard. Last summer he was joined by business billionaire Henry Kravis, Jerry Seinfeld, Tom Hanks and Bradley Cooper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f30ba029d8c90880a4f3a2bff711a7a834f25a68/295_260_1674_1004/master/1674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e13b8604e265708b5f35e349dc0f21db","title":"all the stuff of life goes on here the wine bar that bath fell in love with","story":"Intimate, personalised service has made Beckford Bottle Shop a favourite for first dates, long lunches and more As you enter Beckford Bottle Shop, a new bar, restaurant and wine shop with views over Bath’s Assembly Rooms, it’s impossible to miss the huge, U-shaped sofa skirting the back wall. It’s the focal point of the room and, as it turns out, the focal point of the business. “The sofa creates this space for people to hang out,” says Dan Brod, Beckford’s co-owner. “It’s also communal, so it kind of forces people to talk to each other – which, as a nation, we’re generally terrible at. When you go to Spain everyone hangs out and chats in the village square. The sofa is our version of the square.”The welcoming atmosphere is something the team at Beckford have considered since day one. The owners all come from a background of members’ clubs and own several other “poncey pubs with rooms, I think is the official name,” laughs Brod. As a result, customer experience is key. “We’ve come at the wine world putting wine at the bottom and service at the top. Traditionally wine shops aren’t like that – it’s wine over everything else and they’re pretty intimidating. You walk in, get scared and choose whatever’s on the middle shelf,” he says.“We don’t want to be elitist here.

I almost want this to be a community centre, which sounds ridiculous but that’s what hospitality is ultimately about – community.”Brod is certainly achieving that wish, as every customer references the atmosphere and the people they’ve met over long lunches or cosy evenings in the snugs.“I don’t think I’ve ever sat on this sofa without everybody on it talking to each other,” says customer Soo Arber. “I’ve made a lot of friends here, including a girl who has recently moved to Bath and doesn’t know anyone. She came along with her glass of fizz we got chatting, ended up swapping emails and now regularly meet up. It’s a space where, particularly as a woman, you don’t feel intimidated by sitting alone, because it’s so friendly.”Fellow customers Anthony Christie and Simon Jones say the venue suits different moods. “If you want to socialise with new people, the sofa is a good place for that. We’ve met a lot of people there,” says Christie. “But then you’ve got the snugs downstairs, which are the perfect place to sit with a gang of friends and lose track of time.” As we chat, the waiter brings some salted almonds over. “They’re not on the menu any more but I know you love them,” he says, much to the pair’s joy. “That shows how personalised the service is here,” says Christie. “We have a relationship with all the guys who work here and they take pleasure in recommending wine and food that they know will meet our palates.”Christie and Jones are self-confessed wine buffs but Casey Ryder, Beckford’s general manager, says their customers are a broad range of people. “We’re very non-pretentious and get customers of all ages and walks of life,” he says. “We see lots of first dates but also older couples out having fun, whose kids come and pick them up afterwards.”He says the small plates menu makes it the perfect date spot. “Sharing plates takes out the slight intimidation of a long three-course meal with a huge bill at the end. Plus, if you decide you’re not into each other, you can leave after a plate of charcuterie. If things are going well you can have a whole meal and take it downstairs, which is much more intimate.”While the management team own other pubs and businesses, they view Beckford Bottle Shop as a business within a business – effectively a startup – and that is why they chose iZettle. “They are a genuine disruptor within the fintech industry. They offer something different and the level of customer service is excellent,” says Brod.“It’s incredibly easy to set up, there are no long contracts, as it’s all month by month, and it’s simple to add new machines. It’s all cloud-based, which is good, as we often do events so can take the machines with us. If I was starting any business I’d use iZettle. Card machines are the last thing you want to think about in a business, but also one of the most important. And I love that iZettle regularly check in and care about what we do, because that’s what our business is about: customer care. I like dealing with companies that share our ethos.”Another customer, Joanne Hodges, echoes Brod’s sentiment around customer service. “You don’t even need to look at the wine list here. I often tell them I fancy trying something new and they just know what you’re after. You don’t have to drink the same wine each time you visit, which gets boring. And I love the mix of people – I’ve met locals as well as people on holiday and everyone is lovely. I particularly like sitting at a table in the shop. It’s like being in a library surrounded by books, only with wine.”Brod says the key to the Beckford Bottle Shop experience is that it’s an evolving space. “You can come for coffee with your laptop in the morning, have a small plate and glass of wine solo, or meet with friends and put a lot of plates together for a full meal. We’ve seen it all: proposals, marriages, dates and affairs – the whole gamut. All the stuff of life goes on here.”So, whatever you’re looking to celebrate next time you’re in Bath, try this community centre with a difference.Explore the benefits of joining the iZettle community at izettle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/098f9f86b9bb88486eb9b384fd2157ff7b6de414/0_0_3047_1828/master/3047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90b5166dff1b912eaefcd104dc82cd0c","title":"no deal brexit negotiations brussels","story":"It’s a myth to think it will all be over on 1 November. Crashing out will merely lead to a new chapter of negotiations with BrusselsThey look at the sensible majority of MPs who have voted to thwart it and they assume that, for all the bluster from Boris Johnson and his team, when it comes to the crunch, reason will prevail. That, in the ultimate battle of the Dominics, Grieve will triumph over Cummings.They fail to factor in the central, dispiriting fact: that while no-dealers are united in parliament, the resistance is hopelessly ided. Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and assorted Tory rebels agree that no deal is a disaster, but they cannot settle on a common strategy to stop it. Labour has said it will not countenance joining the other parties in an emergency administration formed for the sole purpose of avoiding the calamity of no deal, even though such a rare, extreme measure is probably what it will take. The result: Johnson will be allowed to commit his act of national arson, because the opposition couldn’t agree on a hose.Similarly, remainers retain a touching, quaint faith in the power of conventions and norms, even when faced with a Johnson-Cummings duo who proved in the 2016 referendum their willingness to trample on every custom, and break every restraint, if it serves their interests. Opponents of no deal reckon defeating Johnson in a vote of noconfidence should stay his hand. But that fails to factor in the shamelessness that could see the prime minister cling on to power long enough to schedule an election for after Britain has crashed out of the EU. Jeremy Corbyn’s letter to the cabinet secretary , pleading for him to rule out such a move, relies on an old-world trust in an unwritten constitution that the Brexiters have shown they are all too happy to trash.Above all, remainers hold tightly to the prospect that no deal will be an instant disaster, a catastrophe that strikes the moment the clock chimes midnight. This ignores the unilateral measures the EU has already put in place to ensure that planes land and financial services don’t collapse. Even those already infamous queues of trucks at Dover may not materialise – not because everything will be fine, but because drivers decide to stay away. “The economic disruption will still be there,” says Sam Lowe, trade analyst at the Centre for European Reform. “It just might not be visible.” If pro-Europeans don’t want hardcore Brexiters claiming vindication when the sky fails to fall in on 1 November, they need to manage expectations now, bracing the public not for an explosion but a slow puncture.Still, the greatest myths lie on the other side. One is the fond hope that Britons will weather the disruption of a no-deal Brexit as stoically as they withstood the blitz. The sight of British holidaymakers driven to tears over flight delays this week, with its echo of that time Britons called 999 to complain about KFC running out of chicken, should disabuse us of that particular daydream.Listen to the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, who earlier this week cautioned those who were “weary of Brexit” that, “This doesn’t end on 31 October.” There might be an instant sense of catharsis, even elation, among leavers on that day, but very soon reality will reassert itself. As Varadkar put it: “If there is no deal, then at a certain point we will have to begin negotiations again.”Doubtless, the hardest of hard Brexiters would dispute that, imagining we could turn our backs on both Ireland and the EU. But there is not a developed country on Earth that hasn’t negotiated some form of preferential trading relationship with its nearest neighbour, especially when the neighbour in question is as comparatively large as the EU is to Britain. So we will be back around that Brussels negotiating table, and the Irish prime minister was right about the first three items on the agenda when we get there. Yep, our old friends: the financial settlement, EU citizens’ rights, and the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.That’s right, after a no-deal Brexit, we’d be back where we started. The last three years would come to seem like an argument between a husband and wife that’s raged in the kitchen. After 31 October, as my colleague Rafael Behr likes to put it, it’d be the same argument – except now the husband would be standing on the street, the front door slammed in his face, shouting his demands through the letterbox.EU leaders think that will happen quickly, a desperate Britain seeking talks within a few weeks of crashing out. They may be wrong. The UK government could look westward in an attempt to seal a trade deal with the US, hoping to grab a trophy that might console us for the losses incurred by Brexit. That could happen fast, if we’re willing to sign here, here and here – making the NHS vulnerable to the pressures of big pharma and opening our supermarkets to chlorinated chicken. Donald Trump may give us that kind of deal. But even that won’t work. Because trade treaties have to be ratified by the US Congress, and the Democrats who control the House have already said they won’t endorse any deal that threatens the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland. So guess what: we’re back at the backstop.This is why Lowe is adamant: “Brexit doesn’t end. It just repeats itself.” This is a never-ending story. It’s why journalists working today realise they will be covering Brexit until their last breath. The contours of the argument might change after a no-deal exit – how bad is it, who’s to blame, should we rejoin the EU? – but the sides will be much as they are today. Unless we call the whole thing off, this is our future: leave v remain, remain v leave, Brexit for ever and ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3261b830401b64d4ee119f6a5cb8463a5720b22/0_56_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a60c9ee3be29b45106cdaee0e0fcb70","title":"a level maths results for 78 students withheld after leak of paper","story":"Edexcel says paper was shared on a closed social media network before the examThe UK’s biggest exam board has confirmed that 78 students have had their exam results withheld following a leak of an A-level maths paper this summer.The security breach, which happened before tens of thousands of students sat an Edexcel maths paper on 14 June, prompted uproar among candidates concerned they would be at an unfair disadvantage.With A-level exam results due to be published next Thursday, Edexcel’s parent company, Pearson, said that all of the maths papers had been reviewed in detail to ensure that candidates got a fair grade that reflected their work.Exam security has become a problem in recent years, with smartphones and social media enabling cheats to disseminate leaked questions quickly, causing huge stress among students every summer. Such is the level of concern that a review of exam malpractice is under way and is due to report this summer.At the time of the maths A-level breach, Pearson said just two questions, which were heavily blacked out, had been circulated on Twitter before the exam, which went ahead amid speculation that the breach had in fact been more widespread.On Friday, the company confirmed that the entire paper had been shared by a number of students on a closed social media network before the exam was sat. “Based on the evidence available to us at that point we had to decide quickly whether or not to replace the paper or reschedule the exam,” said Sharon Hague, Pearson’s senior vice-president for schools.“It was too late to replace papers and rescheduling would have caused significant additional stress and disruption for tens of thousands of students across the country. We knew that our expert assessment team would have the ability to perform detailed statistical analysis once marking was completed to ensure no one was disadvantaged.”Pearson said the source of the breach was narrowed down to a single examination centre. Iniduals were interviewed and their phones examined. The incident was reported to the police who seized equipment from two people who were subsequently arrested. “This police case is ongoing and we hope it will end in a criminal prosecution,” said Hague.The 78 students at the heart of the investigation are having their results withheld while the board’s malpractice procedures are completed.Pearson also addressed widespread complaints from students and teachers that the second Edexcel A-level maths paper sat this summer was too hard. Following a review, it admitted the first two questions were more challenging than might be typically expected of initial questions but insisted overall the paper was fair.“We do appreciate that the experience of sitting this paper, for some students, was not what they had expected in terms of the perceived level of difficulty,” said Hague, who added: “We want to reassure you that independent experts have analysed the papers and confirmed paper 2 was a fair and valid paper, testing across the ability range and the course curriculum.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12bc900f8281fa3ed3785c6fca373e223931724d/0_660_2917_1749/master/2917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fbb58fd9ebccbbdde5c45f2339a809a","title":"confessions of a university dropout","story":"Next week, thousands of students will accept a place at university. After abandoning two degrees, I feel both disdain for academia and a grief for what might have beenLast year, I was having coffee with a curator, a person from whom I hoped to extract paid work at some point. It was one of those inconvenient midweek interludes most people who work in the arts must endure, a vague invitation extended by someone with money and opportunities. There is rarely a particular reason specified for meetings of this kind, no promise of material reward, yet you nevertheless trek into central London, spend three hours and £7 you can’t afford, and try to be your best, most charming self. You work a career-highlights reel into supposedly casual conversation, aiming to appear thrilling, and charismatic, and sexy enough that the curator, or commissioner, or editor might wish to purchase some of your cultural capital.This particular meeting was not going well. The curator looked at her phone more than she looked at me, making me increasingly anxious about my lack of engaging wit, so that eventually I was mugging and pantomiming like a tragic clown to an unresponsive audience. Then, while she was re-checking her email, she muttered something about having to attend her reunion at Cambridge.“Ask me, ask me, ask me,” I begged her inside my head, and then she did.“Where did you go to uni?” she asked.“Oh, I didn’t,” I replied breezily, “I dropped out.”Finally, I had caught her interest. “Now that – that – is interesting,” she said, jabbing her finger across the table.It’s 10 years since I dropped out of university. In that decade, I’ve felt vicious hatred toward academia and pre-emptive disdain for all the snobs I imagine to be hiding inside it. I’ve felt, too, a terrible and consuming grief for what might have been, had I not been too stupid. And I’ve gladly indulged the idiot savant fantasies of over-educated, upper-class arts professionals who find my educational vacuum (relatively unusual for an arts writer) to be refreshing and winningly salt-of-the-earth.When I was a little girl in Waterford, I was clever. I wasn’t a swot exactly, but I loved to learn and was never without a book. I remember finishing novels while still sitting in the bookshop, as my father nattered to some friend he had bumped into, speeding to the end so he could buy me a different one to take home. There is a cutesy bit of family lore which says that when I was four, my grandmother had me on her lap and asked what I wanted Santa to bring me for Christmas, and I replied, pious as anything, “Two little books.”Adults praised me for this behaviour, so I learned quickly that I was clever, and that being clever was a thing that made other people admire me. I wasn’t a particularly attractive child – stubbornly unathletic, doughy, legendarily the only child in a summer camp gymnastics class who failed to execute a tumble – but I didn’t mind that, not yet. I was clever, instead. On a trip to the Irish capital with my father, when I was still quite small, we walked through the campus of Trinity College Dublin and I was mesmerised by its orderliness, buildings that looked like illustrations, the laughing young adults running about in strange, antiquated garb. “I’m going to go here,” I said to my dad, which became true. “And I’m going to sit under that tree doing my homework,” which did not.There are many reasons I dropped out of university, which I did, in fact, not once but twice. The first time was a few months into Film Studies and French at Trinity, subjects chosen because I didn’t have the marks to study English, as I had wanted to, but couldn’t abandon my childhood fantasies of those grand courtyards and exotically Protestant spires. The second was from an English and Cultural Studies course at a smaller college – perhaps things would have been different if I had gone there first time round, but by the time I did arrive I was already too far gone to function.That I did so twice is a detail I smooth over in glib retellings of my past – complicating, as it does, the impression I want to give of a worldly young intellectual who glanced at the bourgeois trappings of academia and quickly rejected them. The reasons are compelling enough: there was mental illness, there was drinking and there was pregnancy, in a time before abortion was legal in Ireland. I’m convinced that having to be pregnant when you don’t want to be, can’t physically bear to be, is enough to drive a person mad.It could be as easy as that: I could say, truthfully, I had a run of bad luck. I suspect, though, that I would have dropped out anyway, even without the legitimate traumas I can wheel out to explain myself to others. When I arrived at Trinity, for all my problems, I still believed myself to be essentially clever and interesting, and within four weeks, that idea of myself, which had kept me safe, had been shattered. It wasn’t as though I had always achieved the best grades, but I had prided myself on an insightful approach to things, an original way of thinking – a delusion which was quickly cleared up for me by my film studies tutor. In one of the first, and only, essays I would ever submit to her, she wrote that my analysis of a marriage in an Israeli film about forbidden love “sounds like it comes from a women’s magazine”, a blow so cutting I can still see it flashing before my eyes in her monstrous green ink.Almost as soon as I began, I was lost. The idea of getting up each day and going to class, of learning over and over again that I was stupid, and crass, and incompetent, did not seem doable. It hadn’t occurred to me that I was there to learn, to become less stupid. I felt I had failed already, fumbled the opening pass. I had arrived to university quite mad already and quickly became exuberantly so, drinking litres of gin by night and lying in bed, shaking with fear, all day long.It wasn’t laziness, exactly, that stopped me trying to work, but that fear. It lay immobile on my chest. All of Dublin, but especially Trinity, felt corrupted by some malign force that I couldn’t break through. Each morning I would wake up in tears and bargain with myself: I could stay in bed and hide again today, as long as I absolutely did something about it tomorrow. I could see a counsellor, call my tutor, get the train home and tell my dad everything. I would do something that would compel movement out of the static in which I was prone. But, as is the way with days, they became weeks, months, and finally years, and the bargain was never squared, so that what I had feared became true and I really did fail.Though there is more I could say on this – details that would both elicit sympathy and make me look like a spoiled little shit – that was all there really was to it. The slow, boring poison of drink and secret-keeping, spread out into every part of my life, so that nothing was safe or good any more. Until I woke up one day and realised I could not remember the last time I had read a book.When I dropped out of university for good, I tried to forget about it. The shame of my failure, which I can still feel plaguing my stomach to this day, was much more acute back then. It was specifically in relation to the hell I had put my parents through and the vast quantities of their money that had been wasted on me – money neither of them had to spare. My parents hadn’t gone to university, but they had both made decent, happy lives for themselves, until I tore them up and drained their bank accounts to fund my two-year breakdown.I wanted to forget because I was so ashamed, and it was easy to forget in a way, because making a living of my own was a new and far more immediate problem than the existential ones I was used to. I spent a couple of years working as an assistant stage manager and in restaurants: intense, urgent places where people asked if you had any cocaine rather than where you went to university. For a while, I was busy forgetting and making ends meet. Everyone I knew who was still at college partied as much as I did and seemed barely to attend lectures. Maybe it wasn’t so shocking, so catastrophic, I began to think, that I was a failure at university. Maybe it was all a big scam.Then my peers began to graduate and their lives began to look different to mine. I was stunned to find that friends my age were earning a salary instead of being paid by the hour. They had decent winter jackets and sipped cocktails with brunch. Some had pedigree toy dogs. They were real people, like the ones I saw in films. I realised that almost nobody I knew did not have a degree, and the few I did were mostly rich kids, encouraged by their parents to follow whatever unprofitable creative dream they had.I began to learn the meaning of intellectual insecurity. One day, near the end of her degree, my friend Fiona had me read an essay she had written about Pet Sematary by Stephen King, which was one of my favourite books. As I did so, it began to sink in that I had sidestepped, not only an experience, the way of living that university entails, but also an entire mode of thinking. I could tell that the essay was very good because it was well written and structured (she got a first, if I recall), but I had no idea what it meant or why someone would write it. It spoke in a language I didn’t know – the one I had been frightened of and alienated by, and so had never tried to learn – and about ideas I did not understand in relation to the novel. What had the phallus to do with Pet Sematary? To me the book was worth something because it made me cry and feel afraid. It dawned on me then that all I knew how to do was feel, not how to think, and maybe now I would never learn. This is what it has come down to again and again: that I am all raw nerves, no finesse. As my old nemesis the film studies tutor said so cruelly, I am women’s magazines, not critical theory.Time passed and I became a writer. I had always been writing something or other, but at 23 I began to produce essays and stories more seriously. I read them at spoken word events and art galleries and published them in zines, if at all. Sometimes I worked and socialised with artists, who all seemed to have at least two degrees and a PhD in the pipeline. A man I was seeing was one of these artists and seemed embarrassed and depressed by the prosaic desk job I worked in to pay my rent at the grotty state of my uneducated life. Around him, and people like him, I became especially bratty in my derision of academic buzzwords, rolling my eyes and drawing on my cigarette outside openings, privately burning with the fervent wish that I might wake up fluent in it all one day. At least then I could deride it honestly.Four years ago, I moved to London and made a proper go of writing, filing opinion pieces and scrappy personal essays at night, in between temping, until eventually I was doing it full time. I now write columns, book criticism and cultural commentary. I’ve never applied for a job as a staff writer, pre-emptively certain my lack of a degree would prevent me getting through the door. Still, people sometimes email me, passing on academic work they have written in which they reference essays or stories of mine. It’s a mind-bending sensation feeling too stupid to understand what someone else is saying about me.Several times I have gone to universities to give guest lectures and have cried tears of pathetic gratitude on the train home – that they would let me do such a thing, get up in front of all those people doing something I couldn’t. It’s shameful, I know, to feel so grovelling toward these institutions. I listen when people tell me what is wrong with these places, the cuts and the corporatisation, that I really didn’t miss out on much, but I always think – well, at least you know.Of course I could know. I could go back and do it all from the beginning, now, as an adult. People do such things all the time. What I find saddest of all about me and academia – this thing I have spat at and mocked, and cried over, and grieved – is that I know I never will. The sense that I was essentially clever and able to do whatever I put my mind to was knocked out of me. I used to believe there was nothing I couldn’t do, but, as it turned out, I couldn’t do the very first thing I tried a fact so shocking I don’t think I’ll ever risk trying to disprove it.I’m happy, mostly, to be a feeling rather than thinking creature, to be ignorant of where things sit in what canon. My internal library has no logistical rhythm. It was curated according to which books made me feel things the most, and at which points in my life. It’s a nice sort of cataloguing, even if useful only to me. There are worse fates in life than to make things you aren’t smart enough to fully understand yourself.But, still, the university has taken up residence in a regretful part of me. I think of that younger self who didn’t doubt she would end up reading beneath that particular tree, and I want to say sorry. I want to say: I wish that day spent hiding hadn’t turned into a week, and on and on. I wish the bargain was struck after all. I wish I could have done it for you.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b3322c96949139b5f14e6b02a462238da947703/0_487_5536_3321/master/5536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f53edbf81fb1424d4bb0224d8cd3bda0","title":"the week in widlife in pictures","story":"This week, wild elephants, baby baboons and sharks that glow in the dark"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6834a483142b0276df40c18fad185d9c01c249c0/512_562_5223_3133/master/5223.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59cc568c48f904fe281968c3ba272896","title":"cocktail of the week manette bars dedalus","story":"A refreshing gin and lemon cocktail with the summery overtones of chilled sauvignonThis beats an oversweet Pimm’s as a summer sundowner any day, though those of a certain age may find it hard to make without channelling the old, “Oooh, I could crush a grape”, Crackerjack catchphrase.5 white grapes, plus 1 extra to garnish5 basil leaves, plus 1 sprig to garnish25ml gin – we use Chase25ml lemon juiceIce10ml sugar syrupSauvignon blanc, to top – we use a fruity New Zealand one3-4 long, thin strips lemon peel, to garnishMuddle the grapes in a shaker, then add the basil and muddle again.

There were no niceties on the pitch, only a demonstration of the chasm between the top of the Championship and the summit of European football as Liverpool launched their pursuit of a first league title for 30 years with a convincing victory.Easier assignments await the Premier League newcomers than an opening night at Anfield. Norwich showed greater adventure than many away at Liverpool and Farke adhered to the principles that won promotion, although that merely invited pressure and played into the hands of Roberto Firmino. The Brazil international was not on the scoresheet – that duty fell to Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Divock Origi after Norwich’s captain Grant Hanley sliced into his own net early on– but he wreaked havoc among the visitors’ back line.Tougher tests await Liverpool too but their impressive opening night was not without problems as Alisson was forced off in the first half with a calf injury. In his technical area Klopp looked more upset at the loss of a clean sheet than his invaluable goalkeeper, and Norwich troubled the Liverpool defence several times, but post-match he admitted Alisson’s injury was the only negative of the night. The £65m keeper will miss Wednesday’s Super Cup final against Chelsea in Istanbul and possibly much longer depending on the results of a scan this weekend.Farke was unapologetic for an approach that resulted in a heavy defeat but offered encouraging signs. “We know we are underdogs in every game and favourites to be in position 20 in May,” the Norwich manager said. “But we will stick to our principles because the squad is made for playing this football.If we park the bus we have no chance in this league.” Norwich started with eight of the players who began the last game of their Championship winning campaign. Liverpool opened with nine of the team that started their Champions League triumph over Tottenham in Madrid. The new Premier League season kicked off to the strains of ’Champions of Europe’ reverberating around Anfield and a mosaic of the European Cup, a Liver Bird and 6 covering the Kop. Liverpool were into their stride as quickly as their supporters.Klopp’s concerns over a difficult pre-season – admittedly played without Alisson, Salah, Firmino and Sadio Mané for the most part – eased with the impressive second-half showing against Manchester City in Sunday’s Community Shield. The sharpness, energy and incisiveness that returned at Wembley were evident again as Liverpool began at an eye-catching pace. Norwich were confident in possession and more threatening than many Premier League visitors to Anfield. But they gave Klopp’s team an early lead and received a punishing introduction to the quality of the top tier long before the half-time whistle brought respite.Liverpool’s first goal of the new campaign came from an inadvertent slice off Hanley’s right foot when the Norwich defender tried to clear Origi’s low cross from the left but succeeded only in finding his bottom corner. Hanley was in despair at his error. Norwich’s torture was only just beginning.Joe Gomez, selected ahead of Joel Matip as Van Dijk’s central defensive partner, instigated the second with a polished pass out to Trent Alexander-Arnold. Salah took over and found himself with only Tim Krul to beat thanks to a series of ricochets off Norwich defenders plus a measured touch from Firmino. Krul was duly beaten by a precise finish into the far corner.Salah turned provider for the third. His corner was headed home by Van Dijk who had only to hold off Jamal Lewis and not even leap to beat the goalkeeper from close range. It was four and a damage limitation exercise for Norwich three minutes before the break. Alexander-Arnold delivered his first assist of the season with a floating cross between the static pairing of Hanley and right-back Max Aarons. Origi, starting in place of Mané, who only returned to training on Wednesday following a post-African Nations Cup holiday, ghosted in to steer a glancing header beyond the over-worked and over-exposed Krul.Norwich did have their chances to reduce the arrears with Teemu Pukki a lively and intelligent presence in attack. The striker, who scored 29 goals last season, twice teed up Marco Stiepermann but the attacking midfielder miscued badly on both occasions. When he did find his range with a half-volley from 20 yards, Alisson was alert to make a fine save.Shortly before the interval, however, Liverpool’s number one collapsed while taking a goal kick having felt his calf give way. He had to be helped down the tunnel following lengthy treatment and, though Klopp was all smiles with Adrián as the new signing came on for an unexpected debut, his demeanour afterwards spoke of deep concern for the keeper who was ever-present in the Premier League last season.The start of the second half was delayed by several minutes due to a problem with an assistant referee’s head-set. Liverpool were immediately on the front foot as soon as play restarted and Krul denied Jordan Henderson a fifth from Origi’s pull-back. Salah maintained the pressure with a delightful back-heel into Alexander-Arnold and his low cross was prodded wide by Firmino, although Origi was better placed to convert.Pukki got the goal his performance deserved when he was released behind a slow Liverpool defence by Emiliano Buendia’s precision pass. The striker finished cleanly under Adrián to give the Norwich fans forced to make a ridiculous journey late on a Friday night something to celebrate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba6fe2aff5c155257c946139334ed245e3557693/0_293_4124_2475/master/4124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8c016a9cbfbe52d0a07fc885fa0c82b","title":"liverpool v norwich premier league live","story":"Liverpool made an early statement of intent with four first-half goals in a cruise at Anfield“For 60 minutes we were really sharp, we were there, we did what we wanted to do. It was difficult for them in the first 60 minutes but I like what they did after that: staying that cheeky and lively, that’s impressive. And they have a lot of good young players in that squad ... But we should have kept the ball better, but that’s normal when you’re not physically at your best ... The main problem today defensively was the reaction to the second balls.” On Alisson’s injury: “He thought something hit him in the calf and that’s never a good sign. That probably means it’s a bit more than a strain but we don’t know. So we have a bit of a problem because our No3 keeper (Caoimhin Kelleher) is injured - he’s coming back but he’s not there yet.” That sounds like an opportunity for any out-of-contract keepers out there. “We are disappointed because we lost. But I’m unbelievably pleased with the character of my team ... to go back and win the second half. But over all we are disappointed we lost. I’m happy with my players’ character and their reaction and we’ll go exactly the same way again in the coming weeks. I want us to be brave and go out and play football with mates: of course we have to be more solid and concentrate more because small details can make a big difference. After a loss you are always in a bad mood but there were positives here.”Pukki: “It was a pretty good second half from us. I think we can take something from that for next week. We were a bit sloppy when they scored but otherwise it was all right.”Krul: “Unfortunately they were on it from the start and unfortunately we gave them a couple of gifts in the first half but we reacted really well. We were a bit naive in the first, which can happen when you’re a young team. But it was a massive learning curve and I’m proud of how we played in the second. It was a massive learning curve. Everybody walked off thinking ‘you know what, if we believe in what we’re doing, we’re going to be a good side this year for sure’.”The first match of the season ends with the expected result but not necessarily with the obvious conclusions: Liverpool will not be especially pleased with their performance despite the emphatic scoreline, because Norwich practically gave them some of the goals and they themselves looked jittery at the back at times meanwhile Norwich, while aghast at the defending in the first half, will not be too dispirited by a heavy defeat they showed they can play and cause problems to top teams and, by the way they improved in the second half, they showed they have heart and are fast learners - they could stay up and they’re sure to entertain this season.90+1 min: Godfrey pumps one at goal from over 20 yards. Adrian blocks but can’t hold the low shot, and Hernandez is first to the rebound. But Alexander-Arnold closes him down to prevent him getting off a shot.90 min: Norwich are determined to finish on the attack. Liverpool’s defenders are finding them very pesky. 88 min: Hernandez and Lewis combine down the left to win a corner. It’s taken short, whereupon Norwich’s play become a bit too convoluted and they wind up giving the ball back to Liverpool by wandering offside.Liverpool substitution: Milner on, Firmino off. The departing Brazilian gets rapturous acclaim in recognition of a splendid performance. Or were the crowd cheering the streaker who ran across the pitch?85 min: Alexaner-Arnold curls it around the wall, but straight at the keeper, who pushes it out for a corner.84 min: Firmino beats Hanley to the ball on half way, then spins and dashes towards the area. Handley catches up with him at the edge of the box and brings him down. Freekick to Liverpool in a mighty promising position - possibly too close for Alexander-Arnold my money is on Salah.Norwich substitution: Drmic on, Pukki off. The Swiss striker comes on for his debut.80 min: Buendia goes for a goal with a 25 yard freekick. Easy pickings for Adrian.78 min: Sloppy play between Mané and Firmino in midfield gives Norwich a chance to nick the ball and spring forward, which they do in great numbers. Nothing comes of it but it’s a positive sign for the visitors and further evidence that despite winning this match comfortably, Liverpool have not been especially convincing today.76 min: Yet more beautiful play by Firmino ‘in the hole’. He then slips in Mane, who pulls a low ball back towards Henderson. Hanley intervenes to put it out for a corner. Salah’s delivery is cleared. 73 min: Alexander-Arnold has a bang from nearly 30 yards. A pretext, seemingly, for the local boy to offer a ball to a chum in the crowd.71 min: Salah directs another corner towards Van Dijk but this time Norwich are wise to it and head clear.69 min: Nice work by Firmino to create a chance for himself, but his blast from 20 yards veers off target.68 min: It’s surprising that Klopp has not made another substitution yet given the busy schedule Liverpool have. Is he expecting the title to come down to goal difference?67 min: Norwich are preparing to introduce Onel Hernandez, who’s a delightfully tricky and powerful wideman. “We’re better than Barcelona,” chirps Paul Bradford after Norwich cut the deficit to 4-1 (and no, to those asking, I did not put money on that scoreline despite predicting it before kickoff). 65 min: Norwich have a spring in their step and are playing as if they know they could score more. And they’re right: they can create chances and Liverpool have been iffy at the back.Buendia spots a smart run by Pukki and provides a dainty through-ball. The Finn produces a perfect finish, denying Adrian a clean sheet and restoring some dignity for Norwich. 63 min: That’s more like it from Leitner. He lets fly with a fierce striker from 15 yards, from a difficult angle, forcing Adrian to tip it over. 61 min: Leitner’s first involvement is a frustrated late trip on Henderson for which he’s booked. Not the impact he was hoping for.60 min: Krul tells his players to push forward so he can send a goal kick long. That’s sensible given how often they have been dispossessed while trying to play out from the back58 min: Robertson takes a dropping ball nicely and then fires a 20-yards shot wide of the far post.56 min: Firmino has again been excellent today, so creative, clever and unselfish. You’d like to see him score as a reward for all the great work he does. You can say that after nearly every match he plays. 55 min: Fabinho tries to sidefoot one into the bottom corner from 25 yards. Krul fumbles it but recovers in time to stop Henderson from prodding in the rebound.53 min: Salah, darting into the right-hand side of the area, tries to use the last defender as a guide around which he could bend the ball into the far corner. IT’s a good effort but misses the target by a yard.52 min: Van Dijk ks a superb diagonal pass forward to Alexander-Arnold, who skips into the box and wins a corner. He takes it himself, and wastes it.49 min: Buends flights over a clever inswinging freekick from the left. Norwich runners break the offside trap but can’t get a good touch on the ball.48 min: Origi flies down the left and delivers low cross into the area. Firmino sells as beautiful dummy to to let the ball run into the path of Henderson, who shoots firs time from 15 yards. Krul pushes it on to the bar! Liverpool quickly regain possession. Alexander-Arnold sends a low cross to the back post, where Firmino gets it under control but takes an age to turn and then shovels an awkward shot wide from four yards!46 min: Technological glitch sorted, the second half finally gets underway. Now have Norwich resolved the communication problems in their defence? There’s a slight delay to the start of the second half because the one of the officials has a problem with his earpiece. The players amuse themselves by knocking balls around among themselves while the officials try to find some replacement kit. Some fans are booking. Jimmy Hill would have sorted this out by now. 45+2 min: Aarons hurls himself bravely in front of a shot by Firmino. Norwich will make it to the interval only four down. “Wow, and this is without Luis Suarez,” chuckles Matt Dony.45 min: Alexander-Arnold curls in another dangerous cross. This time there is a defender close enough to the forward - Firmino - to make the header difficult. No goal.43 min: A gorgeous backheeled pass from Firmino is the highlight of another flowing Liverpool move. They’re having fun now. ““In Brisbane, Australia, I got up at 4:45am to ride into town to watch the game at the pub (Yes, there’s a bar that’s open at all hours for this kind of thing),” says Murray Henman. “Only I went down to the garage to find my bike had been nicked. At least Liverpool are winning.” Sorry to hear that, Murray. I’d like to think it was just a buddy who took your bike to stop you from cycling back from the pub drunk?It’s lovely cross from Alexander-Arnold but hapless defending from Norwich to leave Origi free 12 yards out. The Belgian takes full advantage, heading into the net. Liverpool substitution: Allison can’t continue. On comes Adrian for his first appearance, just days after joining the club. Allison looks miffed and walks off with a slight limp. It looks like this might be an injury that keeps him out for at least a little while or maybe it’s just a case of taking no risks because Liverpool are 3-0 up.36 min: Allison seems to have hurt himself by while slipping after kicking the ball out. He needs treatment. Might we be about to see an early debut for Adrian? 35 min: Pukki skitters down the left, showing impressive pace to win a corner off Alexander-Arnold. Trybull’s gets his head to the incoming corner but nods a yarad wide. 33 min: Norwich are reeling and Liverpool are starting to make merry. Half-time is a long way away: the contest is over but Norwich’s pain could yet deepen. On the other hand, if they cane find a way to at least reverse the flow of play for the rest of this game, they’ll have a positive to take into the rest of the season...31 min: Alexander-Arnold pings a cross in from the right. Firmino takes it beautifully on his chest, sending it upwards to give himself time to adjust his feet for a spectacular volley from 16 yards. Krul bats away a brilliant effort! Robertson’s cross is deflected out for a corner. Salah delivers a perfect centre and Van Dijk plants a downward header into the net from seven yards while holding off Lewis. Without playing particularly well, Liverpool are running away with this.26 min: Stieperman cracks off a decent shot at last, after a lovely flowing ove by Norwich. Allison makes a competent save to push away the German’s swirling shot from 18 yards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb839ef8ebb9509c8c624490b42f89d5af16b22f/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=057dd089b83e021f8ae3cc957b9c3dd1","title":"selfish mother in law treats visits like holiday annalisa barbieri","story":"Just reading your letter made me want to scream, says Annalisa Barbieri. But while she will not change, your situation willI emigrated to be with my husband and we are very happy together, living in a remote city with our infant twins, away from our families. My parents visit once a year and my husband gets on well with them.The issue is my mother-in-law. She doesn’t visit that often but, when she does, I dread it. By the end of her trip, I am unable to interact with her and am just waiting for her to leave.She is the same age as my mother – mid-60s – but when my parents come to visit they want to be helpful they work so hard to give me and my husband a break from the twins. My mother-in-law came a few months after they were born and she said she thought she was coming “on holiday”, expecting to be waited on, as my husband has done for her his whole life – he was basically the parent, as she delegated everything to him.When I told her how I felt (which was my husband’s idea), she got really upset, fled to her room and cried to my husband that I was ungrateful and she was a victim. She then refused to talk to me for rest of her stay. It was a nightmare. Although we parted on good terms, every visit since has followed a similar pattern – she arrives and tells me she is exhausted.I don’t know why she thinks she can come on holiday to our house. It frustrates me so much. She is physically capable, but she is lazy and selfish. If someone can do something for her, she will make them.What can I do? She will not change. I strongly dislike her.It is OK to dislike your mother-in-law. Having read your longer letter, she sounds very difficult – just reading it made me want to scream. The friction caused by having to be with someone whose values and work ethic you neither admire nor agree with is enough to start a bushfire.You didn’t get the mother-in-law you wanted, or probably deserve, but you are not alone. Plenty of women feel like you do. She probably has lots to say about you, too. I am on your side, though – who would visit new parents of twins and not expect to pitch in? But you are right: you are never going to change her. Repeat this to yourself cross-stitch it on to a cushion.So, you need to find a way to deal with her, because she is going to be in your life for the rest of hers. I like how your husband – like legions of men before him – let you tell her how you feel (does he not share your sentiments?) when what is needed is a shared approach. But you cannot change him either if he has always been the parent to his mother. Don’t let her come between you.While your mother-in-law will not change, your situation will. If she is used to being waited on, she probably resents her grandchildren getting all the attention and so is more needy than ever. But your babies won’t always be small: they will grow older and things will get easier. She may be more engaged with older children and, if she is not, the twins will still change the dynamic she may not be able to behave as lazily around them. If she persists, they will make up their own minds about her, especially when they have your remarkable parents with whom to compare her. This will result in interesting conversations, but try hard never to slag her off to them, as this always backfires. Children are amazing observers.Your mother-in-law sounds wounded. Maybe no one ever did anything for her as a child? But this is not your responsibility.Some options: can you visit her instead? Can you put her up in a local B\u0026ampB when she comes to you? If she has to come to yours, remember: asking her to help isn’t going to make it happen. Don’t ask – this will just wind you up more. You manage things when she is not there and the added frustration is due to your expectations. (Her laziness probably also highlights how tired you are. Maybe that is something you need to consider separately.)But – and this is crucial – don’t wait on her either. If she wants to have a siesta or a lie-in, let her. Go out! Let her wake up and find you are not there. Do the minimum that’s needed to make you a decent host. She wants a holiday? Give her one: a budget holiday.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

When my friends’ softly spoken dads boomed, they knew a line had been crossed. I never knew my father, but my mum’s raised voice hardly bothered me. Instead, it was her silence – her pained face and furrowed brow, her deep sigh and the curl of her lips in a frown. I felt that in my chest. This week I did it again: I disappointed my mother.In my defence, the bar for disappointment has dropped considerably over the years. That time as a teenager when I said I was an atheist, or when I got caught taking drugs in my 20s, were perhaps understandable reasons for my mother’s disquiet.These days, the pained face comes for trivial reasons. If I eat a doughnut: disappointment. If I use satnav on a route I should know: dismay. And if I turn up in a crumpled shirt, she will tut me into ironing it.Mum has always been an advocate of smart dressing. She says it is disrespectful not to make the effort. As far as hair goes, buns should be tight, and clothes should be repaired before they are too worn. Time and again she would sit me in front of the sewing machine, demonstrating.I wasn’t listening. To be taken seriously by my peers I had to be confident, which meant looking as if you didn’t care. Anyway, stiff clothes were for aunties and uncles, immigrants whose parents were born under empire and believed you should make sure your shoes are polished, and your collars stiff.So, at 31, I once more take my seat at the sewing machine to fix the falling buttons on my now-crisp shirt. While not convinced by Mum’s point of view, I recognise the value of the skill.

The amount you have will determine what sort of plans you can turn into reality.Putting together a financial plan for each of these defining moments can give you greater freedom and choice. You’ll be able to enjoy each stage without worrying so much about money issues.If you are financially secure, you can take more informed decisions about moving jobs or changing career you may even get better deals on products such as mortgages and loans and you’ll have more time to spend on the things that matter to you – like leisure, travel and family.Taking time to set goals, thinking about what your priorities are, and putting in place a savings scheme for the future are all essential elements in good financial planning. The good news is that it’s never too early or too late to start.You would imagine that you need a lot of money in order to start saving or investing. In reality, even relatively small sums can grow into a sizeable nest egg over time.The real secret of financial planning is making regular contributions and sticking at it over the long term. Building personal wealth is not a quick fix. Taking a lot of risk with your hard-earned cash in the hope of securing a short-term gain could be counter-productive.Instead, you should think of managing your money as a lifelong strategy and the key to future freedom, which can change and adapt as your personal circumstances change. When you are younger, you might take a little more risk and perhaps consider investing as a way of protecting your savings against inflation. In retirement you might need to think about how to protect your funds against sudden falls in value.Whatever age you are, the best way to start is to put away a bit of money at a time and allow interest to accumulate and investments to grow. If you save or invest into an inidual savings account (Isa), then everything you earn will be free of income and capital gains tax – giving your savings plan a boost.If you think of managing your money as the key to freedom, rather than a chore, you gain a new perspective on your finances. There are three key elements to planning for the big events in your life: setting goals, making it a habit, and reviewing your progress.What do you want to achieve with your savings and investments? Identifying a tangible goal – such as saving up a deposit for a home, being able to afford a wonderful honeymoon, or taking time off work after the birth of a baby – can be more motivational than having a vague idea of saving for some undefined future event. It’s important to have a rainy day fund first, for those unexpected events, so you won’t need to dip into your goal pots in troubled times.Now build in a timeframe – when will you need the money? What will you need to do in order to start saving? How much can you start with and could you make savings in your monthly spending in order to free up some spare cash? Small changes can make a big difference over the long term. For instance, if you have one less takeaway coffee at £3 a day, this equates to £15 a week, which over a year will amount to more than £700.If you have multiple goals, split your saving priorities into pots of money – short term, medium term and long term. Short term might be money for a fantastic honeymoon or overseas trip in a year or two medium term might be wanting to save for a house deposit over five or six years and long term will be your retirement planning.When you are clear about your goals and your timeframe, then you can start to think about the best home for your money.For funds you want to access within the next five years, you might consider a deposit account. You can make small incremental payments into a savings account or cash Isa. Moving money from your current account to a savings account on the day you get paid, or setting up a standing order, will mean you’re not tempted to spend it. However, as many of these are instant access, you’ll need to be disciplined about not touching it. If you think you might be tempted, consider a fixed rate savings product that locks your money away, often in return for a better interest rate.If your goal is five years or more away, you could consider investing in a variety of ways, at different levels of risk. Although these carry a higher risk than cash savings, they can also protect your money from the effect of inflation if your investments outperform the rate of interest offered by savings accounts. As you start this journey, it might be wise not to chase big wins or follow fashion – but instead to opt for a slower but safer approach, perhaps choosing funds that invest in a broad range of shares rather than trying to pick inidual companies. There are many sources of information about market trends, and it’s always good to become familiar with these.Any money you put into Pension savings has the benefit of being boosted by tax relief, but you can’t access the fund until you’re at least 55 and it’s best to wait until you retire. You should join a scheme at work if they have one, or save into your own private pension.It’s easy to start off with good intentions, and then forget to continue because of a lack of time or motivation.The key to successful money management is automating your financial commitments. Set up a regular amount to leave your bank account and be paid directly into your Isa or savings account. That way, the money has moved before you spend it, and you never have to set a reminder.Playing the long game can work in your favour, because the interest you build up in a deposit account will accumulate naturally. If you are investing for the long-term in the stock market, you’ll be less concerned with the short-term ups and downs of share prices. Sometimes people approach saving and investment in an emotional, rather than a rational way.It’s easy to buy shares when the stock market is doing well, and then panic after they have fallen. Try to take a long-term view, and check how your strategy is working for the long term, rather than from month to month. Remember: investments should be viewed as a five-year commitment, so make sure you think of these as a long-term strategy.Investments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in. Remember, the value of any tax benefits described depends on your inidual circumstances, and tax rules may change in the future.Whatever your situation, and no matter your level of confidence, HSBC could help you make better-informed investment decisions.

Pop culture should take lessons from it, rather than the other way roundPerhaps we should not be sniffy about the new CEO of the English National Opera, Stuart Murphy, drawing a parallel between opera and Love Island, urging those missing the dating show to visit the Coliseum. “As my teenagers sat glued to the final of Love Island last week,” he writes in the Evening Standard, “it struck me how closely it echoes the drama we see on stage at English National Opera: passion, lust, betrayal, glamour, love, friendship, silliness. Opera has that in spades, just with the world’s most beautiful music.”He’s right. The parallels with reality TV are plain. There’s certainly plenty of buff dimwits in opera. Think of Siegfried, barrel-chested and brainless, tasked with forging a sword, breaking a spear, killing a dragon and walking through a ring of fire to awaken a sleeping goddess before the curtain falls, as if he were in some ancient Norse prototype for a particularly sadistic bush-tucker challenge in I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here.Or, in Götterdämmerung, we find him tricked by a rival into betraying the love of his life. Siegfried is so deranged by Hagen’s drug that he becomes enraptured of another woman and tries to win his own wife Brünnhilde for her brother, Gunther. They don’t allow drugs on the set of Love Island, but otherwise this kind of storyline would keep the twitterati and op-ed commentators seething for weeks about the commodification of women’s bodies and the structural misogyny of heteronormative dating rites – just as they did with ITV’s reality show.Whenever Radio 3 cuts to New York for a live opera broadcast from the Met, the serious laying out of the plot is one of the funniest things on radio. At such moments opera makes The Only Way Is Essex seem like Proust. A bird pecks a king to death (Rimsky Korsakov’s The Golden Cockerel). Women dude it up in unconvincing moustaches and terrible trousers (Il Trovatore or The Marriage of Figaro). Young man change clothes, add hats and facial hair and their devoted girlfriends fail to recognise them (Cosi fan Tutte). Death-bed arias that require more puff than anyone truly expiring from consumption could muster (La Traviata or La Bohème). And then there’s Weber’s Der Freischütz in which a man shoots an eagle with golden bullets to win his bride (based, amusingly enough, on my marriage).Let’s not forget my favourite opera storyline: the man who gives birth to 40,049 babies in one day. It just sounds like an instalment of Channel 4’s Embarrassing Bodies but it’s actually the plot twist of Poulenc’s Les Mamelles de Tirésias after women revolt against bearing babies for reasons too barmy to get into. If ITV had a show called Opera’s Stupidest Storylines to fill the hole in schedules left by Love Island (and it really should), it could run from now until Christmas.What made critics such as Norman Lebrecht set up a harrumphing chorus, though, was Murphy’s suggestion that it would be “healthy” for his as-yet-unappointed new artistic director to be “aware of the pull” of popular culture such as Love Island, Fleabag and superhero films in order to win over audiences to the opera.What Murphy didn’t suggest, but which may be even more healthy, is that popular culture should be aware of the pull of opera, and consider plundering it for material rather than miring itself in franchise remakes of the same old rubbish (Fast and Furious 9 – really?). In particular, I suggest that creatively drained Hollywood should do a reverse takeover of opera. Instead of ENO making Love Island: The Opera, what the world is crying out for is Der Ring Des Niebelungen, the movie franchise. It has three built-in sequels for starters and could be readily cast with Russell Crowe as Wotan, Margot Robbie as Brunnhilde, Tom Hiddleston as Loge and someone who really knows how to play dumb (Channing Tatum?) as Siegfried. Hollywood more than ENO needs to be creatively revived.Murphy is at his most rhetorically feeble when he argues that opera needs to broaden out to survive and to draw in young people. Opera, or any art form, is at its most hopeless and cynical when it strives to second-guess the supposed zeitgeist, when it tries to woo new demographics by retooling what’s worked elsewhere.Opera is at its most biting when we get plunged beneath its sometimes silly surface and exposed to something unexpectedly profound. Take Berg’s Lulu. For all that many productions attempt to lure audiences with promises and posters of a sexpot who can’t keep her clothes on and who is ultimately (spoiler alert!) murdered by Jack the Ripper, it is as heartbreaking and instructive about the patriarchy as any work of art.But here’s the curious thing: something similar can be said of the ostensibly vacuous dramas that play out on Love Island. “Love Island’s capacity to spark wider discussions around consent, relationships and gender is part of what makes it such a fascinating show,” wrote Stephanie Boland in the . Critics of the show focused on the practice of gaslighting. Love Island, it has been suggested, was holding up a magnifying glass to many women’s reality.Which is to say that even what’s regarded as the basest mass culture is rarely as stupid or worthless as detractors might suggest. Just like opera.Opera, what’s more, has dealt effectively with pop culture icons before. It has stooped to conquer. Richard Thomas and Stewart Lee’s Jerry Springer: The Opera was a disgusting but brilliant skewering of the TV host’s working methods, among other things. If there was a problem with Mark-Anthony Turnage’s Anna Nicole, about the tragic life of the eponymous Playboy playmate turned TV personality, it was that the music ran out before the wrenching biographical material.Equally, John Adams’ Doctor Atomic (about J Robert Oppenheimer, Project Manhattan and the ethics of the bomb) or The Death of Klinghoffer (in which Arab terrorists take Jewish holidaymakers hostage on a cruise ship) show that opera need not be all gender swapping and bird-interfering silliness.Maybe Stormzy and Skepta should be invited to do a knife-crime grime opera loosely adapted from Romeo and Juliet at the Coliseum. But, probably, ENO should think of other ways to stave off obsolescence. What works creatively is happily unpredictable what generally doesn’t work, by contrast, is when artistic directors second-guess audiences and commission what they think will get them down with the kids but invariably only makes them look sillier than a Poulenc opera plot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57b36c7104a7fb3cd200e0d033a191b83ebd0de0/1634_366_1769_1061/master/1769.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b3a0e4da58a9ac55ed0515be881446f","title":"no 10 cancels staff leave raising possibility of snap election","story":"Boris Johnson’s chief of staff tells advisers not to book holidays before 31 OctoberBoris Johnson’s chief of staff cancelled all leave for government advisers until 31 October in a missive on Thursday night, raising further speculation the government is planning for a forced snap election in the aftermath of the UK leaving the EU with no deal.Special advisers were emailed by Johnson’s senior adviser Edward Lister on Thursday night, saying there was “some confusion about taking holiday”. They were told none should be booked until 31 October, with compensation considered “on a case by case basis” for those who had already booked leave, though the email said advisers were free to spend their weekends “as you wish”.“There is serious work to be done between now and October 31st and we should be focused on the job,” the email said. The directive angered many recipients, who say staff are exhausted and are facing an unprecedented workload in September and October.One recipient described the email as “posturing” and said special advisers, known as “spads”, are being used as part of the PR war to convince the public the government is serious about no deal.Johnson himself also wrote to all members of the civil service telling them the government’s main focus was now to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. In the letter, Johnson said he wanted to underline that the UK would be leaving on 31 October “whatever the circumstances” and that the civil service must prepare “urgently and rapidly” as its top priority.“I know many of you have already done a great deal of hard work in mobilising to prepare for a no deal scenario, so that we can leave on 31 October come what may,” the letter said.“Between now and then we must engage and communicate clearly with the British people about what our plans for taking back control mean, what people and businesses need to do, and the support we will provide.”Downing Street refused to deny on Thursday that a snap election would need to take place in the first few days of November if MPs forced a vote of no confidence in Johnson in early September, but said the prime minister would ensure the UK had left the EU on 31 October.It remains unclear if anti-Brexit MPs in parliament would be able to swerve a general election, as senior Labour and Liberal Democrat figures clashed on Friday over their parties’ apparent willingness to place conditions on any unity government or coalition prepared to stop a no-deal Brexit.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has said Labour would attempt to form a government in the 14 days following a confidence vote, to try to avoid a snap election, but ruled out Labour backing for any unity government candidate, such as a Tory veteran like Ken Clarke or Dominic Grieve.Labour has said any MP wishing to stop no deal should give their backing to Jeremy Corbyn’s attempt to form a government. However, on Friday the Lib Dem Chuka Umunna, a former Labour MP, claimed a “substantial minority” of his former colleagues would not support Corbyn being prime minister.“The problem there is with the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn taking up the role of leading an emergency government is he cannot command a majority among his own MPs, never mind others like Conservative rebels who would refuse to give him confidence,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“I know, because I have spoken to them. There is a substantial minority of Labour MPs at the very least who simply would not countenance Jeremy Corbyn being the prime minister of this country. So the question is, is there a figure who, as an alternative, could command a majority?”McDonnell tweeted after Umunna’s comments that the Lib Dems appeared willing to risk no deal rather than back Labour.Corbyn wrote to Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, on Thursday accusing the prime minister of plotting an “unprecedented, unconstitutional and anti-democratic abuse of power” if No 10 delayed an election until immediately after 31 October if Johnson lost a no-confidence vote among MPs.In his letter, Corbyn demanded urgent clarification of the purdah rules, which are meant to prevent the government taking major policy decisions during an election campaign.He asked Sedwill to confirm that if the UK is due to leave the EU without a deal during an election campaign, then the government must seek an extension to article 50 and allow an incoming administration to take a decision about Brexit on the basis of the result."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/196ea83d4dde2204c4c4f236d1519819531936a3/0_324_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3bb78b6d189b618ed6ebdebc3d38d2b","title":"anthony joshua rematch andy ruiz jr saudi arabia 7 december","story":"Amnesty International has criticised the decision to sanction Anthony Joshua’s rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabia, citing human rights violations, the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the ongoing war in Yemen.The fight, scheduled to take place in Diriyah on the outskirts of the capital Riyadh on 7 December, was approved by the International Boxing Federation, World Boxing Association and World Boxing Organisation on Friday and announced by Joshua’s promoters Matchroom Sport. Joshua, who will be looking to regain the heavyweight titles from Ruiz after surprisingly losing his first professional fight in New York at Madison Square Garden on 1 June, welcomed the announcement on social media with the message: “Neutral grounds - LETS GO.”But Amnesty International UK’s head of campaigns, Felix Jakens, called for the 29-year-old to “inform himself of the human rights situation and be prepared to speak out about Saudi Arabia’s abysmal human rights record”.“If Anthony Joshua fights Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabia, it’s likely to be yet another opportunity for the Saudi authorities to try to ‘sportswash’ their severely tarnished image,” he added.“Despite some long-overdue reforms on women’s rights, Saudi Arabia is currently in the grip of a sweeping human rights crackdown, with women’s rights activists, lawyers and members of the Shia minority community all being targeted.“There’s been no justice over the gruesome murder of Jamal Khashoggi and the Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen is carrying out indiscriminate attacks on homes, hospitals and market-places with horrific consequences for Yemeni civilians.”Amnesty also voiced criticism over the fight between Amir Khan and the Australian Billy Dib which took place in Saudi Arabia last month, with the British boxer claiming he has signed a deal to face Manny Pacquiao there later this year. Last year the middle-east sovereign state also hosted the World Boxing Super Series super-middleweight final between the British pair Callum Smith and George Groves in Jeddah’s King Abdullah Sports City Arena.The Principality Stadium in Cardiff was among the venues proposed for the rematch but Ruiz had insisted the bout must take place either back in the US or on neutral territory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c94dc1a840ab415696e2bc35231ddbce9614c97c/0_0_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63752cb8bbfd674e70ce2761e66f21c1","title":"leeds catalans super league match report","story":"It was not too long ago that Leeds Rhinos supporters will have been desperate for this miserable season to end but at this rate, they will be ruing the fact it doesn’t last for at least a few more weeks. Everyone associated with the eight-time Super League champions will have feared the worst here when, with half-an-hour remaining, the Rhinos were reduced to 12 men.Leading by just eight points at that stage, the Leeds of as recently as a few weeks ago would have perhaps collapsed. Instead, the manner in which they put a Catalans side harbouring title ambitions this season to the sword underlines the growing belief that relegation here is now highly unlikely.Four points clear of bottom-placed London, with a superior points difference to boot, this – combined with last week’s 44-0 win at Huddersfield – looks more like a top side, as opposed to the one that has been struggling all season. “I don’t feel like I’m dealing with a side fearful of relegation,” Richard Agar, Leeds’ interim coach, said.But as impressive as Leeds were following Brad Singleton’s dismissal, questions must be asked of how Catalans can produce performances as abject as this. They had clawed back a 16-0 deficit to trail by only eight at half-time, but any hopes of a victory vital for their own play-off hopes evaporated in spectacular fashion when they were handed a man advantage.“It looked like we were the team who were a man light,” Steve McNamara, the Catalans coach, said. They were outplayed for the opening half-hour, with tries for Ash Handley and Rhyse Martin, coupled with four goals from the back-rower, making it 16-0. Mickael Goudemand’s try helped narrow the gap to eight - but what followed after half-time was spectacular. Leeds had to survive the first 10 minutes of the second half without Konrad Hurrell following a sin-bin, but when Singleton was sent off shortly after he returned, the Rhinos were then under huge pressure. “It was a moment that galvanised us,” Agar added. Within five minutes of that, they went further ahead when Handley scored his second.As McNamara said, Leeds now looked like the team a man up. Brad Dwyer’s run close to the line then enabled Richie Myler to score, and the scrum-half then claimed his second after his half-back partner, Robert Lui, ghosted through before Lui’s wonderful pass sent Luke Briscoe over in the corner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b5099dd7272a25fdc5441ee59cb15f3ee78f6d2/0_15_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4335fc0fb66bb68eb6b26dce64042371","title":"talking horses hayley turner shergar prize","story":"Last year’s winning jockey has some strong rides at Ascot including Mark Johnston’s fancied Sapa Inca in the ClassicHaving had to wait until last year to win the Silver Saddle at her beloved Shergar Cup, Hayley Turner may be about to win the top jockey’s prize for a second time. The 36-year-old has fallen into a useful-looking set of rides at the Ascot event, notably Sapa Inca (3.25) in the Classic.From the Mark Johnston yard that had 50 winners last month, this improving filly went second close home in a big field at Glorious Goodwood after trouble in running. She can cap what could be a big day for her rider, who has been having a thin time in recent weeks.1.05 Ascot Turner also has a fine chance in the opening Dash, aboard Lancelot Du Lac, who will be remembered for winning the Stewards’ Cup under Frankie Dettori in 2017. The veteran has dropped a few pounds since then but was in good heart on the all-weather when last seen in the spring and his stable is going well now.1.40 Ascot It was a high-class piece of form that Billy Ray put up when chasing home Withhold at Newbury and he looked the likely winner a furlong out. With Danny Tudhope aboard, he should do well in the Shergar Cup Stayers.1.55 Haydock David O’Meara does well with his imports and the ex-French Young Fire has a couple of bits of form to his name that suggest he might be nicely treated on this mark.2.15 Ascot The Shergar Cup Challenge represents a welcome step down in class for Melting Dew, who has fared poorly in much hotter races this year. He is back down to a fair rating, the cheekpieces return and Turner may have another big chance here.2.30 Haydock With Oisin Murphy up, Miss O Connor appeals most in this Listed race. Unbeaten in two, the ex-Irish filly is taking a big step up in class but could hardly have done better than scoring by 11 lengths on her British debut.2.50 Ascot Andrew Balding has a fair Shergar Cup record and his Zwayyan is of interest in the Mile, having been beaten less than a couple of lengths in the race last year.

The mood is more subdued for its breakfast show Bout, an exploration of brotherhood through the motif of boxing. It’s performed – literally toe-to-toe at times – by three barefoot siblings from Taiwan’s Chang Dance Theatre and has the same grace and depth as last year’s Bon 4 Bon, in which they similarly drew upon their memories of childhood.Bout opens with one of the brothers pacing the stage alone. Another soon follows him. A third falls into step. When one of them hits the floor, he lies motionless while the others share a duet whose intermittent freeze-frames are suggestive of sports photography, all the intent and reaction captured in stillness. Has the prone brother been KO-ed? Or is he merely dreaming in the corner of a shared bedroom?Bon 4 Bon explained how the boys grew up in close quarters and exuded warm nostalgia with its fresh, bursting tales of eating mangoes on hot days. That show’s soundtrack looped Paul McCartney’s Blackbird and the music of Bon Iver, whose track Babys is used in Bout, delivering a summery rush to some fluid B-boy moves. But this time the choreography, by dancer Chien-Hao Chang, has more unsettling layers, the mood set by David Lang’s haunting Stick Figure for chamber ensemble. The dancers repeatedly lean on each other with a tangible ease, yet more than once the show captures the moment where play-fighting betrays genuine grudges.The brothers spiral between stances and their handstands and other childhood poses become more literal boxing bouts, with one of them taking the role of referee: familiar to any sibling who has ever played peacekeeper. The trio are dressed alike in understated suits but their age range and the cut of their clothes means they don’t all look exactly like adults. A suit can just as easily exaggerate boyishness.Only the solo choreography lacks punch. Perhaps these brothers need each other’s bodies to spar with and support? When they do, Bout floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ecdce1b727804864891c2ac7d6efe8469657f11/0_0_4287_2572/master/4287.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7644e5b0d4ca07856b94692d0f66358","title":"only 12 booked me under my real name bame performers at the fringe","story":"We asked BAME comedians, performers and  readers about their experiences at the Edinburgh fringeFor Scotland’s capital August means the rushed arrival of throngs of people in search of the quality theatre, comedy and performance arts on offer as part of Edinburgh’s month-long festival fringe. Billed as the biggest arts festival in the world, the fringe offers thousands of different shows with plenty to cater for almost any taste you might imagine. Almost.For the last two years grassroots organisation Fringe of Colour has been on a mission to highlight and rectify the lack of BAME presence at the festival. Last year Layton Williams, an actor who has appeared on BBC Three in Bad Education and on the West End as Billy Elliot, accused security staff at the Assembly George Square venue of racial profiling after they alleged that he looked like a man who had jumped the fence two weeks before. The venue eventually apologised, but Williams’ experience is not unique.Not every experience is negative, and of course the fringe also offers unimaginable opportunity for directors, producers and performers, with many considering it the highlight of their creative year. Those in charge of the fringe are also making an effort to increase inclusivity, having designated ersity as one of the key strands of this year’s fringe central programme. But is enough being done to welcome people of all backgrounds to the fringe? We asked comedians, performers and  readers about their experiences.I haven’t had any proper negative experiences unless you count the occasional hostile reaction from drunk men when I tell them I’m not Romesh Ranganathan. When I told another BAME friend that I hadn’t experienced much racism in Edinburgh, they said “It’s because you get to be Nish”. I’ve been able to exist outside of the usual micro-aggressions because of the status I have at the fringe.I have heard more stories about racism in Edinburgh from other performers over the last couple years, but I suspect that is a symptom of a wider national problem with people becoming more comfortably racist. There’s also this weird strain of liberal racism where people believe they’re so liberal that they couldn’t possibly be racist – at another festival I had a woman describe me as “a little bit namaste”. Edinburgh changed my life and I owe my career to it so I really want to give more people from backgrounds like mine the sense that this is something they can do too. Nish Kumar, comedianI’ve heard other BAME acts talk about how their friends don’t even come up to Edinburgh because of the associated costs. The fringe is definitely skewed towards wealthier people who might not be from a BAME background, and so you’re fighting an uphill battle if you’re doing something for a more varied audience. Personally I haven’t experienced any racism at the fringe, but I still think what Fringe of Colour is doing is fantastic – if only there was a way they could eliminate the transport and hotel costs since they’re likely the biggest inhibitor stopping young BAME people from going up to the fringe. Arnab ChandaOur poetry collective, 4 BROWN GIRLS WHO WRITE, did a five-day run at the fringe with three sell-out shows. We felt that it was important to create a space for performers of colour. Both our white and non-white audience members felt empowered by the stories and voices on our stage and we even had one white member of the audience tell us that the show had helped her reflect on her privilege. We received a great response from our audiences who said there weren’t any shows like ours. We were there to creatively challenge the audience through our collective vulnerability of what it’s like to be “othered” – and people were welcoming of the space we created. 4 Brown Girls Who Write, performers and poets, LondonI love the fringe and want to keep going every year, but sometimes the subtle ignorance can get tiring. As a hijab-wearing Muslim, people handing out flyers for shows don’t approach me but instead give flyers to my white, non-hijab wearing friends. At comedy shows I’ve gotten used to comedians never trying to begin a conversation with me, no matter how many times I sit in the front row, and at bars I find people staring at me before quickly looking away. These things may be small but they all add up to make it clear that the fringe is not meant for people who look like me. Faaiza, 33, LondonI have a love-hate relationship with the fringe. Having worked on it 14 years out of the past 29, I love that the best emerging acts come to Edinburgh in August and I get the artistic nourishment that isn’t there the rest of the year. However, as an Indian woman and a creative, I hate how invisible BAME work and artists are made, through lack of access to high-profile showcases, press coverage and reviews. It can be a breeze for some BAME people but for most of us it’s not about our art, it’s about physical and mental stamina. To succeed you have to be a fighter. Annie George, performer, EdinburghI’ve been attending the fringe for almost 13 years and have never felt out of place as an ethnic minority. Perhaps more widening access schemes and better space and accommodation would help ease this problem. I think it would be more effective to reduce prices of concession tickets overall and have cheaper tickets for Edinburgh locals. It’s expensive to put on a show and this is off-putting for poorer people generally. Gurjit, EdinburghAs brilliant as the fringe is, I did look around when I was there and think: “why is this not more erse?” And I didn’t have an answer to that. With more ersity you get more interesting stories, which is especially important for art forms like theatre. There’s nothing wrong with admitting that a lack of ersity is a problem for the fringe. I do believe that to fix that there has to be a top-down movement with people who organise it making an effort to be more inclusive.

As it is written in the scriptures, he arrived empty-handed, with neither set nor props, to present a show about a messianic cult leader at the end of days. As the prophets set down, he required the audience to gather, congregation-like, in a big circle, as if we too were readying ourselves for the apocalypse. In accordance with the sacred texts, we thumbed our way through the hardback book left on our chairs. It was called Total Immediate Collective Imminent Terrestrial Salvation and we saw that it was good.The conceit, in this formally adventurous show, is that the Bible-like book in our hands, captivatingly illustrated in pencil sketches by Rachana Jadhav, is the same book determining the actions of Sol, a young girl brought up in a closed community after some environmental disaster. Played with openness and heart by Shyvonne Ahmmad, she has been indoctrinated to believe nothing will happen unless it has been set down in these pages.It’s a deterministic view but, as the book contains the script of the show, it is also the correct one. For as long as the performance takes place, we are not in control of what happens. Not even when the audience takes turns to play the parts of Sol and her estranged mother Anna, played primarily by Susan Vidler with similar guilelessness.Behind all this is the mood of today’s era of environmental doom. The shamanic cult leader Miles, played by Crouch, claims to have all the answers and, although his scientific reasoning is gobbledygook and the impending eclipse is just an eclipse, his sense of certainty is appealing. The extent to which the play is a warning against blindly following charismatic leaders makes it a statement of the obvious. But, rather like Ontroerend Goed’s Are We Not Drawn Onward to New ErA, it also seems to be articulating a more urgent idea about resisting fatalism, changing things for ourselves and, perhaps, welcoming the happy ending of a post-eclipse dawn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9246162c8ac6988ed5fce4a1a0f9e8c4daa6979c/0_17_1717_1030/master/1717.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d8262ef6224ed5f3c083e22a549d9d2","title":"knives being sold via facebook without any age check","story":"Recent UK law bans online sellers sending knives to homes unless buyer verified as 18+Knives can be purchased on Facebook Marketplace without age verification despite a recent law requiring checks, the  can reveal.In May, the UK government made it illegal to send knives sold on the internet and elsewhere to homes without ensuring the buyer was over 18 as part of reforms to strengthen existing legislation.However, the  was able to purchase four sets of knives from sellers on Facebook Marketplace without age checks. The knives were then sent to a residential address.It is the job of councils’ local trading standards departments to enforce knife sales laws, while the onus for verifying buyers’ ages on Facebook ultimately lies with the inidual sellers – often members of the public – in the absence of a regulated age-checking system.A wide selection of culinary knives are available on the social media site, including nine-inch cleaving knives, as well as a limited number of non-culinary knives which are not allowed to be sold on the platform.Facebook said it worked quickly to remove any such items, and invited the  to highlight adverts which did not conform to its policy. It subsequently removed one item, a culinary Damascus steel chef knife which came with a free non-culinary knife.“We take safety very seriously, which is why you have to be 18 or older to use Facebook Marketplace,” a spokesperson said. “We do not allow the sale of non-culinary knives on Marketplace and work quickly to remove these items.”Facebook ascertains the age of its users by asking people to provide their date of birth. It recognised it could do more to ensure children could not access inappropriate content.Patrick Green, the chief executive of the Ben Kinsella Trust, said retailers had age checks which could not be circumvented and that Facebook and its online marketplace had a legal and moral responsibility to keep knives “out of the hands” of young people.“Without the need to employ much subterfuge to disguise their age, large knives can be purchased from this site and delivered without robust checks taking place,” he said. “Facebook not only have a moral duty to bring this site up to standard, but a legal one too.”The Home Office said it was an offence to sell any bladed article to a person under 18 and that the Offensive Weapons Act, which passed into law in May, bans online sellers from sending knives to residential addresses unless age verification checks are in place.“It is totally unacceptable for social media companies to allow the illegal sale of weapons on their platforms and they must do more to stop this practice, as well as reporting it to the police,” a spokesperson said. “We are making it harder than ever for young people to purchase knives, including online.”Although the Home Office has supported “enforcement activity” in more than 1,000 cases of physical retailers selling knives to children, it said the laws around everyday knife sales were for trading standards departments to enforce.National Trading Standards (NTS) has urged retailers and online marketplaces to strengthen their approach to illegal weapon sales. It said that local trading standards departments were ultimately responsible for policing the sales.“Our findings from a new programme of test purchasing has identified a number of retailers selling knives without undertaking required age verifications,” a spokesperson said.The Conservative MP Ross Thomson, an officer with the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on knife crime, called for the government and police to urgently investigate any evidence that knives were being sold illegally on Facebook.“There is little point in passing legislation if it is not being upheld,” he said. “Facebook must be challenged on the ease with which people are able to purchase these items online.” Recently drafted government legislation has proposed the establishment of an independent regulator to hold online companies to account over the sale of illegal goods and make them more responsible for children’s safety online.A number of high street and online retailers have restricted access to knives in their stores, or stopped selling them altogether, as knife crime surges across the UK, particularly in London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0151f2b49e122cdc1591fdad94d17e468ecf90e0/0_403_2661_1597/master/2661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b420d086e7d52cf89d1f0b5e79efc7a","title":"chase bank cancels all credit card debt for canadian customers","story":"Clients ‘over the moon’ at US lender’s move as it withdraws from marketChase Bank is forgiving all outstanding debt owed by customers of its two Canadian credit cards as it exits the country’s market.Customers using the Amazon.ca Rewards Visa and the Marriott Rewards Premier Visa were pleasantly surprised to find the balance on their credit cards had been wiped clean.The US-based bank, part of the firm JPMorgan Chase \u0026amp Co, announced in March 2018 that it was closing its two Visa cards and leaving the Canadian credit card market after 13 years.It confirmed on Thursday that it was forgiving all outstanding debt owed by customers of its two Canadian credit cards.Douglas Turner, a 55-year-old long-haul trucker living in Coe Hill, Ontario, was delighted to learn the bank had wiped clean his C$6,157 (£3,860) debt. “I was sort of over the moon all last night, with a smile on my face,” he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. “I couldn’t believe it.”Turner initially thought he had missed a payment when he received a letter from the bank. Instead, he found it had not only wiped out his debt but also reimbursed his latest C$300 payment.Turner used his Amazon.ca Rewards Visa to buy electronics and supplies for his six dogs. When factoring his monthly interest on the card, he estimates he has saved more than C$7,500.“It’s crazy,” he said. “This stuff doesn’t happen with credit cards. Credit cards are horror stories.”Chase Bank has not disclosed how many Canadians had signed up for the cards or how much debt it had wiped out.Paul Adamson, a 43-year-old south-western Ontario resident, immediately phoned the bank when he saw the balance on one of his credit cards had been wiped clean.“She said: ‘Actually, you owe no balance,’” Adamson told the Canadian press. He was about C$1,645 in debt. “I was a little confused and kind of sceptical at her response,” he said. A letter confirming the debt had been wiped clean came the next day. “I was stunned, I’ll be honest. I just said: ‘Hey, here’s one more thing we don’t need to worry about.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/372972bb30fdc2b8698a1177904e45c39694b418/0_157_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8af8c3b40f36377c861ea3be18129c22","title":"italy moves closer fresh elections bolster far right","story":"Matteo Salvini reiterates call for snap vote as his party plans motion to dismantle coalitionItaly appears set for fresh elections that could push the country further toward the far right.Matteo Salvini, the deputy prime minister, reiterated his calls for a snap vote on Friday, adding that any attempt to block his wishes and install a new ruling coalition would be unacceptable. His League party said it would present a no-confidence motion in the senate in its push to dismantle the tempestuous coalition with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S).The developments follow Salvini’s demand for the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, to reconvene parliament to collapse the administration.Salvini has already announced his candidacy to be the next prime minister, even though elections are yet to be scheduled. “Give us the strength to take this country in hand and save it,” he told supporters during a rally in the coastal city of Pescara on Thursday night.Giorgia Meloni, the Brothers of Italy leader, said new elections could bring about a government set on making the “politically incorrect reforms that Italy needs”.Both Salvini and Meloni have whipped up support with their anti-immigrant, “Italians first” rhetoric, and by attacking Pope Francis and his calls to help migrants. The pontiff expressed his concerns over nationalism in an interview with La Stampa on Friday.“I am concerned because we hear speeches that resemble those of Hitler in 1934. ‘Us first, We … We … ’ These are frightening thoughts,” he said.Salvini’s political ascent has been aided by his relentless campaigning, using social media and rallying on piazzas and beaches across the country with what he presents as a ‘man of the people’ style and a defence of Italian ‘identity’. His demonising of a succession of so-called enemies – migrants, Roma people, Muslims, leftwing ‘do-gooders’ – has also formed a reliable component of his success.The rift between the League and M5S widened on Wednesday when parliament rejected a motion by M5S to block a high-speed rail project linking Italy and France. M5S has built most of its popularity on vehemently opposing the long-stalled project but was outvoted by the League and opposition parties.The League’s motion said “too many no’s are bad for Italy” and that “those who waste time, harm the country”.Conte, who does not belong to either party, reacted angrily to Salvini’s demands. “This government wasn’t at the beach but working from morning until night,” he said late on Thursday, referring to Salvini’s seaside escapade last week.Conte, who had held separate talks with Salvini and the country’s president, Sergio Mattarella, said it was not up to the deputy prime minister to summon parliament and “dictate the steps of the political crisis”.The decision to dissolve the government and call new elections rests with Mattarella. He could also choose to install a technical government in order to pass the 2020 budget in the autumn, but that option is unpopular with all parties.Luigi Di Maio, the M5S leader and co-deputy prime minister, said he was ready to return to the polls as “the League has mocked Italians”. Nicola Zingaretti, who heads the centre-left Democratic party, said elections were the only option.Francesco Galietti, the founder of the Rome-based political consultancy Policy Sonar, said: “The crisis is now a fully fledged one and nobody, not even Mattarella, can put the genie back in the bottle. “The reality is that Salvini caught everyone by surprise, even his own people, but by doing so he’s cornered Mattarella into a very nasty position.”Parliament could be reconvened by 20 August to confirm the end of the administration. Elections would then have to be held within 50 to 70 days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b95e3e64df388e772acd8516edce3171de77812/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5893ea5bdf0dc803f11d1029b23efc6f","title":"medhanie tesfamariam berhe mistaken identity facebook friend request","story":"Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe spent three years in an Italian jail, but says he does not blame the man for whom he was mistakenEvery morning for three years, a prison guard would wake him by calling someone else’s name. At every court hearing, a judge would order him to stand and sit back down, using a name that was not his own.Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe was the victim of what has become one of Italy’s most notorious cases of mistaken identity. Detained in May 2016, he was accused by prosecutors in Palermo of being one of the world’s most sought-after human traffickers, Medhanie Yehdego Mered, aka the General. While the real smuggler lived it up in Africa, Berhe, who had earned his living milking cows and working occasionally as a carpenter, faced up to 14 years in jail.His ordeal began when a Facebook friend request he had speculatively sent to Mered’s wife, finding her attractive, led investigators to conclude he was the smuggler operating under a new identity.“More than once I contemplated taking my life,” Berhe, 32, told the . “When you live through such an injustice and discover you’re helpless to do anything about it, you lose the will to live. Try to see it my way: I wasn’t arrested, I was kidnapped and my three years in jail were like an endless nightmare which all started with a friendship on Facebook.”The saga ended last month when a judge in Sicily acquitted Berhe of a charge of human trafficking, confirmed he was a victim of mistaken identity, and ordered his immediate release.Today Berhe lives as a free man in a small apartment among the alleyways of Palermo’s historic centre, having been granted asylum by Italy. His years in jail have made him reticent and wary.“Sometimes I’m terrified the police will arrest me and my nightmare will start all over again,” he said. “From that hellish day I was arrested, my life will never be the same.”On the afternoon of 24 May 2016, Berhe, a refugee from Eritrea, was drinking coffee in a bar on the outskirts of Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, when six police officers pulled a hood over his head, took him away and forced him on to a flight to Rome.His arrest, after an investigation ning two continents and five countries, was presented to the media as a triumph for a new anti-trafficking strategy. The suspect was touted as the “Al Capone of the desert” and the first human smuggler to be extradited from Africa. But on his arrival in Italy he had no idea what he was supposed to have done wrong.“I thought they wanted to extradite me to Eritrea because I had deserted the military,” he said. “During my first interrogation in Rome they told me I was accused of being Mered, a human trafficker. I thought they were crazy.”Berhe was eventually transferred to Palermo’s Pagliarelli prison to await what would become a long and controversial trial. Two DNA tests, an array of witnesses and reporting by the  and New Yorker, who spoke to the real smuggler, all pointed to his innocence but the ordeal continued.It transpired that the smuggler had been in jail in the Middle East – most likely the United Arab Emirates – for using a forged passport when Italian prosecutors travelled to Sudan and arrested Berhe in his place. Mered’s incarceration meant wiretaps Italian investigators had on his phone had gone quiet, as had his Facebook posts. The investigators assumed Mered had changed his number and social media accounts.A few months earlier, Sicilian prosecutors had learned that an Eritrean named Medhanie had become Facebook friends with the trafficker’s wife, Lidya Tesfu. They decided this account must be Mered’s, based on his and Berhe’s shared first name. Britain’s National Crime Agency provided the telephone number associated with the account to Sicilian prosecutors, who tracked it to Khartoum and issued an arrest warrant.“If I could go back in time, I’d cut off the finger I used to send a friend request to that woman in the autumn of 2015,” Berhe said. “How could I have known she was Mered’s wife? She just looked nice. That Facebook contact landed me in this absurd situation.“If Mered hadn’t been arrested in the UAE, the Italians would have likely arrested the real trafficker in Khartoum. And if I hadn’t friended Lidya, by this time I probably would have reached my family in Europe.”Tesfu herself gave evidence that Berhe was not her husband, but the prosecutor Calogero Ferrara dismissed it along with all other suggestions that he had put the wrong man in the dock. At the close of the trial, he demanded a 14-year prison sentence.Meanwhile Mered had been revealed by the  and the Swedish broadcaster SVT to have been released from jail in the UAE and to be spending his substantial trafficking earnings in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, where he was a regular in nightclubs.“I knew that while I was locked up, Mered was enjoying his freedom somewhere in Africa,” Berhe said. “But I don’t blame him. It’s not his fault I was arrested in Khartoum, and he didn’t keep me in jail for three years.”Berhe was cleared of trafficking but found guilty of the lesser charge of aiding illegal immigration for having helped his cousin reach Libya. Because he had already spent three years in jail, the judge ordered his immediate release.“I still don’t understand why I was found guilty of aiding illegal immigration,” he said. “Migrants don’t take cash during their desert journey because they risk getting robbed. That is why my cousin asked me to forward his money to a man who would help him on his way. This is perfectly normal in Africa, especially among Eritreans, because we have no passport. How else are we supposed to reach Europe?”With asylum secured in Italy, Berhe has the rest of his life ahead of him. “People ask me what I’m going to do now that I’m free,” he said. “Well, first I need to realise that my nightmare is over and this freedom is not a dream. And if it is, I beg you: don’t wake me up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f1dfcbfc3d0a2c0e15eb68e2952bc9fe05f6d56/0_345_5218_3132/master/5218.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d1c019f475908888574dcf0f41fcf09","title":"russian pharmacies report rise in sales of iodine near military explosion","story":"Five killed in explosion and pharmacies run out of iodine after reports of higher radiationRussia’s state nuclear agency Rosatom confirmed on Friday night that five of its staff members were killed in an accident during tests at a military site in northern Russia earlier this week.The accident occurred during tests on a liquid propellant rocket engine on Thursday, the RIA news agency said, citing Rosatom.Russian authorities had previously said two people had been killed in the incident and that a nearby city had reported a rise in radiation levels when a rocket engine blew up at a testing site in the Archangelsk region. Shortly after the explosion, gamma radiation levels in the neighbouring city of Severodvinsk reportedly jumped to 20 times their normal rate for nearly half an hour, contradicting the ministry’s assurances that all levels were normal.Further explosions, injuring nine people, were reported on Friday at the site. Russia’s defence ministry said in a statement it had been hit by lightning.Pharmacies in two northern Russia cities have reported increased sales of iodine, a chemical used to limit the effects from radiation exposure.Since the incident, a section of a bay in the White Sea has been closed to civilian shipping and photographs of rescue workers wearing protective gear including respirators have raised concerns about the accident. A statement put on the Severodvinsk city website about the heightened radiation levels has also been deleted, erasing some of the only official confirmation that the incident occurred at all.Reports on the Arkhangelsk news site 29.ru and the Interfax news agency said that local pharmacies had reported a run on iodine tablets since Thursday, and that locals were concerned about the possibility of exposure.“They bought everything yesterday, first iodine tablets, iodomarin, then normal iodine and potassium iodide,” one pharmacist told Interfax. “The fuss began around 17.00 and by the time we closed they had bought everything. People at the register were discussing the news about the radiation in Severodvinsk, the explosion and the soldiers.”Footage obtained by the news site Mash showed emergency workers wearing protective suits with respirators putting an injured person into an ambulance. On Friday, the Baza news site reported that the injured men had been brought to a Moscow clinic for radiation poisoning treatment and released a video of a convoy of police cars and ambulances travelling through Moscow. The clinic and a defence ministry spokesman both declined to respond to questions about the report.It is not clear what rocket engine or weapon system was being tested at the military site. Russia’s northern fleet, including its nuclear-powered submarines, is based nearby, and the explosion reportedly occurred near a firing range for submarine-launched ballistic missiles.Theories include an explosion aboard a ship with a nuclear reactor or a failed test of the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile mentioned by Vladimir Putin during a televised speech in 2018. If the spike in radiation levels was a coincidence, fear of contamination from toxic jet fuel may also explain the use of protective gear during the operation to rescue those injured in the blast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d805fd42405cbda5cf1c3668695aab30abf3738d/0_176_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47164a981abd2ec768895e2ef3456bc7","title":"vladimir putin 20 years in power in pictures","story":"Twenty years ago the Russian president Boris Yeltsin appointed his fourth prime minister in less than 18 months: Vladimir Putin, then a relatively unknown security services chief with scant experience of politics.

Joe Hohenstein, one of the Corkman’s legal team, said the ex-Beatle’s threatened deportation in the 1970s was over “exactly the same charge” which has hampered Mr Byrne’s struggle for a green card.In 1972, US president Richard Nixon’s White House ordered Lennon – who had been living in New York with his wife Yoko Ono for a year at the time – out of the country. It was an election year, and the famous couple were outspoken in their protest against the Vietnam War, urging people to give peace a chance by voting Nixon out of office. Lennon’s charge for cannabis possession in London in 1968 was cited by the Nixon administration as reason for his being improperly allowed into the US. After a three-year fight against deportation proceedings, a three-judge federal panel ruled his conviction in Britain didn’t meet American standards of justice.A year later, he won permission to remain on as a permanent resident. Embarrassment“The British version of marijuana possession is identical to the Irish version,” said Mr Hohenstein. “That is – even under the current US immigration law – not something that should make someone what we call inadmissible. “That is one of the main things we will be trying to bring home when we file these papers in court.”Mr Byrne said the minor cannabis charge 14 years ago in his hometown of Fermoy, Co Cork, was the “big issue”. “We have been trying to correct it and find the right person to hear our argument,” he told RTÉ’s Drivetime. “I’m embarrassed for the government of Ireland and the government of the United States for something like that to ruin my life, my wife’s life, my children’s lives. “People are out there doing serious crimes and they can go wherever they please. It is horrendous . . . Why should that ruin my future?”Mr Byrne (37), who lives in Philadelphia, was arrested by Ice (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officials last month and spent two weeks in prison, under a Trump-ordered crackdown on illegal immigration. The father-of-three overstayed his ESTA visa waiver when he entered the country in 2007 and married his American wife Keren two years later. His attempts to regularise his residency ever since were complicated by the cannabis possession charge.Two applicationsMr Hohenstein said he would be filing two different court applications in the ongoing battle against deportation: one to a federal appeals court, on the removal of his deportation order another in a lower federal court, appealing the decision to deny Mr Byrne his green card. The lawyer said Mr Byrne had put his wife Keren through nursing school, helped her build a career as a registered nurse and that their family connections in the US are “extremely strong”. The US immigration system deals very “severe and harsh consequences for minor incidents” which have a “really disproportionate impact on inidual persons and their US citizen families”, he said. But he believes the deportation efforts are the result of a “misunderstanding” and that Mr Byrne’s “interaction with the authorities in Ireland do not make him inadmissible in the US.”Mr Byrne said he was “giving no energy” to the thought of having to leave the US. “I don’t want to think about something that may never happen,” he said. “I will think of that when I’m on a plane. Right now, I’m thinking of how I can stay here and continue.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3982037.1565383327!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us is unlikely to help ireland in brexit stand off says bruton","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer taoiseach John Bruton said many in the US Republican Party were in favour of Brexit in the hope it would lead to a break-up of the EU. File imag: Dara Mac Dónaill  The Ireland should not expect the United States to play any role in resolving the current impasse between the UK and the European Union over the backstop given president Donald Trump’s desire to break up the EU, according to former taoiseach John Bruton. “I don’t see America being any help because as far as I can see Donald Trump would like to break up the European Union which he sees as a sort of an adversary and he would prefer the US to deal with inidual European countries rather than have to deal with the EU as a whole,” Mr Bruton told an audience in Co Cork on Friday evening.British prime minister Boris Johnson is insisting that the EU drop its demand for the backstop - guaranteeing no hard border on the island of Ireland - or the UK will crash out of the union on October 31st.A former EU ambassador to the United States, Mr Bruton said Mr Trump was the first US president to adopt such a position towards the EU while many in the Republican Party were also in favour of Brexit in the hope it would lead to a break-up of the EU.“There are people in the Republican Party like Tom Cotton who said they are ready to negotiate a deal with Britain as long and as soon as they leave the European Union… I think that’s just designed to feed into the pro-Brexit rhetoric in the UK,” he said.“I think those sort of statements are aimed at encouraging public opinion (in the UK) towards a no-deal Brexit in the in the hope of people holding that view in the United States that a no-deal Brexit could contribute to breaking up the European Union.“Well, it’s not going to happen. The European Union is not going to break up and it’s certainly not going to break up on the initiative of president Trump or Steve Bannon or other people with Irish names serving in his administration.”Speaking at the opening night of the West Cork History Festival in Skibbereen, Mr Bruton was asked by ITN News Political Correspondent, Carl Dinnen in an Q\u0026ampA session what advice he would give the UK when it came to negotiating a trade deal with the US.“I would advise them to give priority to getting a trade deal with the European Union first. I don’t know the exact multiple but I would guess they do four to five times the amount of trade with their physical neighbours in Europe than they do with the United States.”Mr Bruton said he believed if the UK had reached a secure trade deal first with the EU, it would stand them in good stead when it came to negotiating a deal with the US as it would leave them less vulnerable to the US reneging on any deal.He said that negotiating with the US without a trade deal with anyone else in place would leave the UK exposed to possible changes in the US position once Brexit had been achieved in keeping with president Trump’s anti-European Union agenda.“President Trump may go back to his mercantilist approach to trade agreements which won’t be favourable to Britain or China or Mexico or Canada or any of the countries that have done trade deals with the United States because the United States doesn’t stick with its trade deals.”Mr Bruton pointed out that the US had withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) while it had renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as they wish to deal on their own terms. “I wish the British Government luck,” he concluded.

Pictures of two questions were posted from a Twitter account the day before the exam with the details scribbled out. An accompanying message invited students to get in touch via a direct message “if you want tomorrow’s A-level maths, stats and mechanics paper 3 exam”.Pearson confirmed on Friday that as well as the two questions that were widely circulated on Twitter ahead of the exam, investigators also found that an entire exam paper was shared by students in “closed social media networks”.Examiners were told to look out for students who did particularly well in the two questions that had been leaked online and to pass information on to investigators for further analysis.  This is the third consecutive year that questions from Edexcel’s Maths A-level papers have surfaced online ahead of the exam, as the exam board struggles to get a grip on the leaks.Each year police have launched criminal investigations, but so far no one has faced charges. Two men were arrested in June in connection with this year’s leak, but both were released without charge.A possible criminal offence would be theft, if the exam paper had been improperly obtained from the exam board.  Last summer, Maths A-level questions were reportedly being auctioned off online for hundreds of pounds the night before the exam. In 2017, last minute changes were made to the exam paper at some schools after it emerged that questions had been disseminated ahead of the exam.Pearson said that a total of 29 candidates have been disqualified over the previous two leaks, and police investigating the 2017 breach have now passed a file to prosecutors.Maths is one of the most popular A-levels, with around 60,000 students sitting Edexcel’s exam each year. Pearson has launched a series of new security measures in an attempt to bring leaks under control.For the first time this year, micro-chips were inserted into some packs of A-level and GCSE questions, allowing Pearson track the time, date and location of an exam pack if it is opened prematurely. This means that the school or exam centre in question can immediately be alerted to the breach, which should make it easier for officials to swiftly identify the perpetrator and contain any potential leak before information is circulated more widely.  This year was the first full cohort of pupils to take the reformed Maths A-level, which was designed to be more challenging and better prepare sixth form students for university.  Pearson moved to reassure students that they will receive a “fair grade that accurately reflects their work”.Students picking up their A-level results last summerThe exam board\u0027s announcement about the leak comes as thousands of pupils prepare to pick up their A-level results next week.Universities are preparing to slash their entry requirements in a bid to recruit as many students as possible after results day.While the entry requirement for each course are advertised online, universities usually agree to accept students with A-level grades well below their official offer during the clearing process. Russell Group institutions have been accused of “flooding” the clearing market to “hoover up” students on to cheap courses. Over 4,200 courses still have vacancies at 18 out of 24 of the country’s leading universities, according to a Daily  survey.  Traditionally sought after undergraduate courses such as Law, Medicine,  Economics, English Literature, History  and Philosophy are still available at Russell Group universities, many of which have embarked on ambitious expansion plans in recent years in order to take on more students.Less than a week before A-level results day, Bristol and York universities both had 100 courses with empty places. Meanwhile Liverpool had 918, Cardiff had 345 and Exeter had 270.The lifting of student number controls in England in 2015 means that universities can now recruit as many undergraduates as they see fit.But the move has led to accusations that they now act like commercial ventures, seeking to maximise their revenue by recruiting as many students as possible.Robert Eaglestone, a professor in literature at Royal Holloway University, said: “Since the cap was removed, the higher tier universities have been hoovering up students.  “All students bring in £9,250 so they use arts subjects like English and Philosophy to cross subsidise other disciplines. If you are looking at your university’s bottom line, these are obvious choices for expansion.”He said that top universities are now using the clearing process as a “commercial advantage” on their rivals, rather than its original purpose which was to give students who have missed their grades a second chance.  A dip in applications has left even top ranking institutions scrabbling to fill places, as a decline in the population of 18-year-olds has led to applications to British universities falling by one per cent.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

We were his favourites, I suppose,” Crick said.Peter Farquhar mentored Michael Crick throughout his lifeOver the decades, as Crick rose to fame on the BBC and Channel 4, the pair kept in touch and met regularly. In 2015, the journalist received a phone call from his old teacher, who was bursting with good news.“I remember that Peter told me about Ben Field, and how he had bought a dog called Kipling. He said it was the best thing that ever happened to him,” Crick told the .Soon afterwards, however, Crick received another call. This time it was not Mr Farquhar but a man who introduced himself as a friend of Field, and that they planned to set up an “Institute of Peter Farquhar Studies” and film a documentary about Mr Farquhar’s work.But Crick was unsettled by the call. “It was almost as if they were mocking him. I felt very uncomfortable about it,” he said.“Peter was a good writer, but he was hardly Charles Dickens. I thought they might be taking him for a ride.”The documentary came to nothing, but soon he received another call. This time the news was more concerning.“He said that Peter was in a really bad way and that he had a drink problem. He told me that Peter was becoming forgetful, and leaving his phone in the freezer,” Crick said.“I spoke to Peter, and he said he would go to get tested for dementia. I said I’d come round to see him, but I never got round to it. Obviously I regret that now.“You have to wonder if it was part of a softening up process. We were being prepared for the possibility that Peter might die of alcohol poisoning. And it worked on me, I’m afraid.”Not long afterwards, Crick was informed that Mr Farquhar had indeed died. Crick said he was told that Field had bought a bottle of whisky and Mr Farquar had drunk too much of it and had died.“I thought ‘What a dreadful thing to happen to these young men.’ I actually wrote them notes telling them that they mustn’t blame themselves. I thought they must be going through agony.“Obviously I found the whole story hard to believe and in particular the idea that Peter had an alcohol problem. “But I didn’t suspect for a moment that he could have been murdered. On the contrary, in fact. I was glad that he had found these two young friends to look after him.”“Of course I wish that I’d done something,” said Crick.“It’s my job to spot when people aren’t telling the truth, although I’m sure I’ve been successfully lied to many times over the years.“But the whole story is so extraordinary, that in truth, I never suspected a thing.”Duke and Duchess of Sussex share quote from Princess

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker.

Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Phantom Thread has all the trappings of a conventional period romance. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, a famous dressmaker who falls in love with Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress who later becomes his muse. Paul Thomas Anderson’s twisted romance flies off in some psychologically dark and unexpected directions, but the arc is that of a storybook love affair, of two people taking extraordinary measures to hold onto the one they love.Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga scored big at the box office with last year’s A Star is Born remake, but for many, the definitive version was released nearly 65 years earlier. James Mason plays the alcoholic actor whose career is on the wane, while Judy Garland is the supremely talented up-and-coming singer he meets in a nightclub. Although there were two other major screen versions of the story – one in 1937, the other in 1976 starring Barbara Streisand and Kris Kristofferson – Garland boasts the strongest singing voice of any, and her chemistry with Mason is superb.In this futuristic romance, Joaquin Phoenix plays a man who falls in love with an artificially intelligent computer system, voiced by Scarlett Johannsson. Her – written and directed by Spike Jonze – treats Phoenix\u0027s courtship with all the sensitivity of a flesh-and-blood romance, and what could be a cringe-worthy or facetious premise instead blossoms into a touchingly sincere examination of love in the age of technology.This romcom from 1999 brings Hugh Grant’s down-to-earth bookshop owner into the orbit of an A-list actress played by Julia Roberts, and the unlikeliest of British love affairs ensues. Scripted by Richard Curtis, who had already proved himself a dab hand in the genre with Four Weddings and a Funeral, the film manages to stay charming and keep its tone light, even as its romantic plotline descends into schmaltz.True Romance has an all-star cast that includes Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini, but eyes are mostly kept on the whirlwind romance struck up between Clarence and Alabama (played by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette), who go on the run with a suitcase full of cocaine belonging to a notorious gangster. Quentin Tarantino’s script wades through some heavy subject matter, and includes plenty of his characteristic violence, underscored by an effective score from Hans Zimmer.620 Harold and Maude (1971)Age-gap relationships are common in cinema, but seldom like in Harold and Maude. Harold (Bud Cort) is an 18-year-old with an overbearing mother who spends his free time staging elaborate fake suicides. After meeting Maude (Ruth Gordon), a 79-year-old woman trying to grab life by the horns, he falls in love. Hal Ashby’s off-beat cult classic doesn’t shy away from the social taboos of their relationship, but make no mistake, Harold and Maude is an earnest and deeply moving romance at its core.720 Beauty and the Beast (1991)The classic French fairy-tale – about the love between a beautiful woman and a prince cursed to live as a beast – has been adapted countless times, most recently into a live-action blockbuster starring Emma Watson. Disney’s 1991 animated musical, however, is the superior on-screen rendering of the romance. Although elements of the story now seem problematic – most glaringly the idea of the Beast imprisoning Belle, and she loving him despite this – there\u0027s still a lot of appeal in the songs, and the hand-drawn animation is fluid and endearing.Positioning three of Old Hollywood’s most beloved stars at the corners of a love triangle, The Philadelphia Story is one of the most enduring romcoms of all time. Navigating its way around the strict Production Code rules regarding extra-marital affairs, George Cukor’s film tells the story of a orced couple (Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant) who are drawn back together despite the allure of a third party (Jimmy Stewart). All three actors play to their strengths: Grant is suave and sardonic, Stewart wide-eyed and self-effacing, while Hepburn is given a strong role in the woman who must choose between her capable suitors.In Carol, Cate Blanchett plays Carol Aird, a woman in the midst of a difficult orce who falls in love with a young photographer, Therese, played by Rooney Mara. The film – a sexy and stylish period piece directed by Todd Haynes – won a host of Oscar nominations, and stands as one of the most specific and deftly crafted representations of female desire in mainstream cinema, earning a particularly devoted fanbase in the LGBTQ community.The highest-grossing French-language film of all time in the US, Amélie is a modern-day fairy-tale about a socially maladjusted young woman who decides to dedicate her life to impishly and secretly helping others. The film leans into the tweeness of its premise, as well as the romance of its Parisian setting, to build a gradual love story that’s straight from the heart. It’s not all sweetness, however, and some of the more world-weary touches – such as Amélie’s lover working in a sex shop – help give the film some sharp edges, and a comic bite.Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger as two sheep herders who go through a turbulent but passionate romance. The film’s open and unapologetic depiction of sex and queer relationships made it a landmark release for LGBT representation in mainstream cinema.Directed by Frank Capra, master of the feel-good film, It Happened One Night mixes screwball comedy with heartfelt romance. Claudette Colbert plays a wealthy socialite who decides to slum it with an abrasive but charismatic news reporter, played by Clark Gable. One of only three films to ever win all five major Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay), It Happened One Night endures as the gold standard for a classical Hollywood romcom.1320 Call Me by Your Name (2017)Set in an Edenic villa “somewhere in Northern Italy”, Call Me by Your Name tells the story of Elio (Timothée Chalamet), a smart but directionless 17-year-old who falls in love with his father’s research assistant Oliver (Armie Hammer). Luca Guadagnino’s languid romance is well on its way to being considered a modern queer classic and it made an instant star out of Chalamet when it hit cinemas in 2017.Richard Linklater’s minimalist romance pairs Ethan Hawke with Julie Delpy as two love-struck strangers who meet on a train and spend the evening together wandering around Vienna. The naturally romantic city is the perfect background for a soft and thoughtful meditation on love, fate and missed opportunities. Hawke and Delpy reportedly crafted much of the naturalistic dialogue through improvisation sessions, for which they were uncredited. They would, however, be credited in the film’s two sequels – Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013).2016 Best Picture winner Moonlight is a radical film: a queer romance with an all-black cast that captures a boy’s coming-of-age with heart-wrenching specificity. Chiron, the protagonist, is played by three actors across three chapters of his life – and the third act, in which an adult Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) reconnects with an old flame, is one of the most heart-rending in modern cinema. Writer-director Barry Jenkins showed himself to have a poet’s ear for dialogue and James Laxton’s camerawork perfectly captures the vibrancy and the physicality of romantic attraction.1620 In the Mood for Love (2000)One of the most acclaimed pieces of Asian cinema of all time, In the Mood for Love is a masterful study in love behind closed doors, tracking the emotional affair between two people who realise their spouses are having an affair together. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are exceptional in the lead roles as two soulmates struggling to contain their desire. In 2016, the film was voted the second-best film of the 21st century in a BBC critics poll.David Lean’s tender depiction of an unconsummated extra-marital affair remains one of the finest love stories ever told, and frequently ranks among the best British films ever made. Adapted from Noel Coward’s one-act play Still Life, Brief Encounter focuses on the relationship between Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) and Dr Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard). Their courtship is bookended by two fateful scenes at a train station – once meeting, once parting. It’s hard to estimate how many hundreds of on-screen romances have ended with a teary-eyed lover being carried away on a train, but none have done so as memorably as Brief Encounter.When Harry Met Sally took Annie Hall’s subversion of the romcom genre and removed the neuroses and pseudo-intellectualism. The result was a breezy, observational romantic comedy starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as two unlikely lovers. Screenwriter Nora Ephron based much of the film on its eventual director, Rob Reiner. When Harry Met Sally would become a massive hit, spawning an iconic catchphrase (“I’ll have what she’s having”) and even a stage adaptation in 2004.Jack Lemmon plays bedraggled corporate yes-man CC Baxter, who falls in love with elevator operator Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), who is also his boss’s mistress. The 1960 masterpiece, directed by Billy Wilder, is equal parts cynical and romantic, and features one of the most compelling will-they-won\u0027t-theys in the history of cinema.The romance of Casablanca has resonated throughout the 20th century. Its dialogue is among the most-quoted in film history and its locations – the piano bar the airfield – are indelible pieces of Hollywood iconography. Humphrey Bogart is the perfect romantic lead as Rick Blaine, the bitter, lovelorn club owner in French-occupied Morocco whose ex-lover Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) arrives with her new flame Victor Laszlow (Paul Henreid), who is wanted by the Nazis. Casablanca has been mimicked and parodied so many times throughout the years that it’s easy to forget quite how inventive it is in its depiction of a love affair torn apart by the brutality of the outside world.Phantom Thread has all the trappings of a conventional period romance. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, a famous dressmaker who falls in love with Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress who later becomes his muse. Paul Thomas Anderson’s twisted romance flies off in some psychologically dark and unexpected directions, but the arc is that of a storybook love affair, of two people taking extraordinary measures to hold onto the one they love.Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga scored big at the box office with last year’s A Star is Born remake, but for many, the definitive version was released nearly 65 years earlier.

It’s not all sweetness, however, and some of the more world-weary touches – such as Amélie’s lover working in a sex shop – help give the film some sharp edges, and a comic bite.Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger as two sheep herders who go through a turbulent but passionate romance. The film’s open and unapologetic depiction of sex and queer relationships made it a landmark release for LGBT representation in mainstream cinema.Directed by Frank Capra, master of the feel-good film, It Happened One Night mixes screwball comedy with heartfelt romance. Claudette Colbert plays a wealthy socialite who decides to slum it with an abrasive but charismatic news reporter, played by Clark Gable. One of only three films to ever win all five major Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay), It Happened One Night endures as the gold standard for a classical Hollywood romcom.1320 Call Me by Your Name (2017)Set in an Edenic villa “somewhere in Northern Italy”, Call Me by Your Name tells the story of Elio (Timothée Chalamet), a smart but directionless 17-year-old who falls in love with his father’s research assistant Oliver (Armie Hammer). Luca Guadagnino’s languid romance is well on its way to being considered a modern queer classic and it made an instant star out of Chalamet when it hit cinemas in 2017.Richard Linklater’s minimalist romance pairs Ethan Hawke with Julie Delpy as two love-struck strangers who meet on a train and spend the evening together wandering around Vienna. The naturally romantic city is the perfect background for a soft and thoughtful meditation on love, fate and missed opportunities. Hawke and Delpy reportedly crafted much of the naturalistic dialogue through improvisation sessions, for which they were uncredited. They would, however, be credited in the film’s two sequels – Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013).2016 Best Picture winner Moonlight is a radical film: a queer romance with an all-black cast that captures a boy’s coming-of-age with heart-wrenching specificity. Chiron, the protagonist, is played by three actors across three chapters of his life – and the third act, in which an adult Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) reconnects with an old flame, is one of the most heart-rending in modern cinema. Writer-director Barry Jenkins showed himself to have a poet’s ear for dialogue and James Laxton’s camerawork perfectly captures the vibrancy and the physicality of romantic attraction.1620 In the Mood for Love (2000)One of the most acclaimed pieces of Asian cinema of all time, In the Mood for Love is a masterful study in love behind closed doors, tracking the emotional affair between two people who realise their spouses are having an affair together. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are exceptional in the lead roles as two soulmates struggling to contain their desire. In 2016, the film was voted the second-best film of the 21st century in a BBC critics poll.David Lean’s tender depiction of an unconsummated extra-marital affair remains one of the finest love stories ever told, and frequently ranks among the best British films ever made. Adapted from Noel Coward’s one-act play Still Life, Brief Encounter focuses on the relationship between Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) and Dr Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard). Their courtship is bookended by two fateful scenes at a train station – once meeting, once parting. It’s hard to estimate how many hundreds of on-screen romances have ended with a teary-eyed lover being carried away on a train, but none have done so as memorably as Brief Encounter.When Harry Met Sally took Annie Hall’s subversion of the romcom genre and removed the neuroses and pseudo-intellectualism. The result was a breezy, observational romantic comedy starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as two unlikely lovers. Screenwriter Nora Ephron based much of the film on its eventual director, Rob Reiner. When Harry Met Sally would become a massive hit, spawning an iconic catchphrase (“I’ll have what she’s having”) and even a stage adaptation in 2004.Jack Lemmon plays bedraggled corporate yes-man CC Baxter, who falls in love with elevator operator Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), who is also his boss’s mistress. The 1960 masterpiece, directed by Billy Wilder, is equal parts cynical and romantic, and features one of the most compelling will-they-won\u0027t-theys in the history of cinema.The romance of Casablanca has resonated throughout the 20th century. Its dialogue is among the most-quoted in film history and its locations – the piano bar the airfield – are indelible pieces of Hollywood iconography. Humphrey Bogart is the perfect romantic lead as Rick Blaine, the bitter, lovelorn club owner in French-occupied Morocco whose ex-lover Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) arrives with her new flame Victor Laszlow (Paul Henreid), who is wanted by the Nazis. Casablanca has been mimicked and parodied so many times throughout the years that it’s easy to forget quite how inventive it is in its depiction of a love affair torn apart by the brutality of the outside world.“It’s great that Bridget Jones is resonating with the daughters of the original audience – girls in their late teens and early twenties,” said Fielding. “Even if it does make me feel like Snow White’s mother.”\u0026nbspShe added: “At heart Bridget Jones was always about the gap between how we’re expected to be and how we actually are. In the age of social media that gap has got horrifyingly wider.\u0026nbsp“I hope Bridget helps people to laugh and remember that being warm, funny human and flawed is OK and doesn’t require an Instagram filter.”The documentary will include archive footage and interviews with Fielding and the friends who inspired the original characters, as well as celebrity fans playing tribute to the character.Being Bridget will air on the BBC in 2020The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The balance of exporting manufacturers that have increased orders also fell to +9, down from +21 in the same quarter last year. In services, it fell to +5 from +14.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersUncertainty has increased significantly since the April to June period as the prospect of a no-deal Brexit has become more likely under Boris Johnson’s government.The BCC warned that many businesses are not ready for the “immediate and abrupt” changes that leaving the EU without a\u0026nbspdeal would bring.It urged the government to fast-track through paperwork that all UK businesses will need\u0026nbspto trade with the EU after Brexit.A “worryingly low” number of firms have obtained an “Economic Operators Registration and Identification” number\u0026nbsp(EORI), which is required for customs purposes, the BCC said.How badly could Brexit disrupt farming exports from Northern Ireland?Hannah Essex, co-executive director at the BCC, said: “There is real frustration among business communities across the UK at the lack of clarity about trading conditions after the UK leaves the EU, and we’re already seeing the impact of that uncertainty.“While the majority of firms want the government to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit, we’re calling on the government to put practicalities first and implement measures to ensure firms are as prepared as possible for whatever scenario they face. A crucial first step would be to automatically issue all necessary companies with an EORI number to minimise the hoops that firms need to jump through to be ready for day one.“There are many fundamental outstanding questions relating to the rules and processes of trade in the event of no deal.“While the Department for International Trade has been working with third countries to ensure the rollover of existing FTAs, many of these critical arrangements have not yet been formally agreed, and firms can’t plan for the future based on warm words. Maintaining preferential access to countries where the EU has trade agreements is critical to maintaining competitiveness in key markets.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the fundamentals of the British economy are strong â wages are growing, employment is at a record high and we are forecast to grow faster than Germany, Italy and Japan this year,” Javid said in a statement.“The government is determined to provide certainty to people and businesses on Brexit \u0026nbspthat\u0027s why we are clear that the UK is leaving the EU on 31 October.”Here\u0027s the full story on the UK\u0027s unexpectedly poor economic performance from The Independent\u0027s business and economics editor, Olesya Dmitracova:\u0026nbspUK economy shrinks for first time since 2012 as fears of no-deal Brexit chaos mountThe pound is hovering perilously close to the 31-month low against the dollar of $1.208\u0026nbspit reached earlier this month.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s now at $1.2083...One bright spot in today\u0027s economic numbers was the continued resilience of British consumers.\u0026nbspSpending rose 0.5 per cent in the second quarter, although this was down slightly from 0.6 per cent in the previous three months.\u0026nbspConsumers have seen wages begin to rise above inflation in recent months.A British-West African industrial consortium has submitted a last-minute rescue offer to snap up the British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, the Press Association reports.\u0026nbspPA understands the unnamed industrial group has submitted a late bid to the government in an effort re-establish the international trade credentials of the site.\u0026nbspThe consortium, which involves a leading UK civil engineering company operating in West Africa, is the latest to enter the fray to take control of the steel supplier after it collapsed into liquidation 11 weeks ago.\u0026nbspMore on the potential impact of closure on Sconthorpe, here:\u0026nbspBritish Steel: Closure would ruin a historic industrial town and allow Britain to be ‘held to ransom’Package holiday firm On the Beach has blamed the plummeting pound foe a profit warning\u0026nbspissued today.\u0026nbspIt says\u0026nbspsterling\u0027s tumble\u0026nbspagainst the euro has forced it push up its holiday prices compared to competitors.\u0026nbspUnlike many of its rivals, On the Beach it does not hedge its exposure to currency changes.John McDonnell has seized on the latest GDP figures, which he says are a\u0026nbspdirect result of Tory incompetence.\u0026nbspThe Tories\u0027 Brexit bungling, including Boris Johnson now taking us towards no-deal, is breaking the economy.\u0026nbspMore on the reaction to today\u0027s numbers from political correspondent Ashley Cowburn:\u0026nbspBoris Johnson accused of \u0027breaking economy\u0027 over no-deal Brexit threats as recession fears mount\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAdvertising firm WPP led Friday\u0027s FTSE 100 firms as its shares jumped after it performed ahead of analyst predictions.\u0026nbspInvestors cheered the beleaguered firm\u0027s revenue performance as its major turnaround programme gathered pace in the second quarter. The company, which was left struggling after a string of client losses following Sir Martin Sorrell\u0027s exit last year, limited its revenue decline to 1.4 per cent\u0026nbspfor period.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPress AssociationThe pound is back to its lowest in more than two-and-a-half years against the dollar.\u0026nbspIt has fallen 0.5 per cent to $1.2067, a level last visited in January 2017.\u0026nbspAgainst the euro the pound has fallen\u0026nbspto a new two-year low of €1.078, down 0.7 per cent today.The FTSE 100 closed down 0.6 per cent to 7,242.79.\u0026nbspThe FTSE 250 index of mid-sized firms was down 0.3 per cent to 19,085.12.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTaken by itself, a 0.2 per cent contraction of UK GDP between April and June would not be a major concern, says Michael Kitson\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspan economics lecturer at Cambridge University.\u0026nbspBut the alarm bells should be ringing with the Office of National Statistics (ONS) alerting about a “slowing in the underlying figures” combined with concerns about the government’s economic policy.\u0026nbspEconomists are united by one thing in the wake of the troubling GDP figures: Brexit will make them worseOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The slide could be even steeper as the OBR’s prediction was based on the assumption of a particular type of no-deal Brexit – the less disruptive of the two laid out by the IMF earlier this year.Howard Archer, economic adviser to the EY Item\u0026nbspClub, forecasts a similar decline, saying house prices would quickly fall by about 5 per cent as the economy weakened and the market was mired in acute uncertainty over Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU.For now, house prices look on track for hardly any growth over this year.\u0026nbspAccording to RICS, a net balance of 9 per cent of respondents reported a fall in average prices over the past three months in England and Wales. Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the result is consistent with the official measure of prices showing a rise of only 0.5 per cent in 2019.\u0026nbspHalifax data also showed that UK house prices dropped slightly in July for the second consecutive month and now stand at £236,120 on average.“The market continues to tread water,” said Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax.\u0026nbsp“In the longer term, we believe there is unlikely to be a step change in market activity until buyers and sellers see some form of resolution to the current economic uncertainty.”RICS echoed this prediction, noting that its survey now points to zero growth in sales – as well as a steeper fall in prices – in the next three months.On Thursday Boris Johnson reiterated his trademark message that Britain will leave the EU on 31 October, even though no progress has been made on securing a withdrawal agreement acceptable to both sides.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1343 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1443 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1743 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2143 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2743 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2943 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3143 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that.

Chrissy Teigen, an outspoken critic of the Trump administration, was among those who reacted to Rock’s tweet. She shared it and told the musician: “You’re pathetic” – signing her message “Chrissy Teigen” in an apparent imitation of Rock’s tweeting style.Swift publicly endorsed two Democratic candidates in Tennessee, her home state, during the 2018 midterms, after years of not making political statements.She has since spoken out on topics such as sexism in the music industry and LGBT+ rights.Rock’s tweet has been met with more than 15,000 comments, many of which dismissed his comments against Swift.One person branded his message “sexist”, “ignorant” and “ dripping with jealousy”, while someone else called it “lame and unoriginal”.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The balance of exporting manufacturers that have increased orders also fell to +9, down from +21 in the same quarter last year. In services, it fell to +5 from +14.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersUncertainty has increased significantly since the April to June period as the prospect of a no-deal Brexit has become more likely under Boris Johnson’s government.The BCC warned that many businesses are not ready for the “immediate and abrupt” changes that leaving the EU without a\u0026nbspdeal would bring.It urged the government to fast-track through paperwork that all UK businesses will need\u0026nbspto trade with the EU after Brexit.A “worryingly low” number of firms have obtained an “Economic Operators Registration and Identification” number\u0026nbsp(EORI), which is required for customs purposes, the BCC said.How badly could Brexit disrupt farming exports from Northern Ireland?Hannah Essex, co-executive director at the BCC, said: “There is real frustration among business communities across the UK at the lack of clarity about trading conditions after the UK leaves the EU, and we’re already seeing the impact of that uncertainty.“While the majority of firms want the government to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit, we’re calling on the government to put practicalities first and implement measures to ensure firms are as prepared as possible for whatever scenario they face. A crucial first step would be to automatically issue all necessary companies with an EORI number to minimise the hoops that firms need to jump through to be ready for day one.“There are many fundamental outstanding questions relating to the rules and processes of trade in the event of no deal.“While the Department for International Trade has been working with third countries to ensure the rollover of existing FTAs, many of these critical arrangements have not yet been formally agreed, and firms can’t plan for the future based on warm words. Maintaining preferential access to countries where the EU has trade agreements is critical to maintaining competitiveness in key markets.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It occurs so that MPs can decamp the Commons chamber and travel to gatherings of party members across the country.\u0026nbspLeaders of all the main parties use the major event in the political calendar to set out their policy agenda and vision for the future, while thousands of activists gather in the conference halls.If MPs do decide to cancel the autumn recess, however, it is almost certain the conferences themselves will go ahead – not least due to them being a major source of income for the political parties.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A mosque is seen amongst residential housing from the air during a mass take off at the annual Bristol hot air balloon festival in BristolAn Asiatic lioness eats meat during feeding time ahead of World Lion Day at London ZooBeer enthusiasts taste beer and ale during The Great British Beer Festival at Kensington Olympia in west London.

For significant issues, such as Brexit, this is where any change in direction will be finalised, and voted on by party members and affiliates.It will also be Boris Johnson’s first chance to address the Conservative Party membership since succeeding Theresa May as prime minister.\u0026nbspDominic Cummings, the PM’s senior adviser in Downing Street, has already told aides the event this year will be treated as a Brexit rally – as the party remains steadfast in its commitment to deliver the UK’s exit from the EU by the 31 October deadline.Rather than set pieces on the policy agenda and the traditional departmental priorities from senior cabinet ministers, all eyes will be on the Halloween Brexit date.Theoretically, the conferences could be a scaled back affair this year as the constitutional battles rage on at Westminster, with just senior ministers and frontbenchers attending the gatherings while MPs stay put in SW1.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the fundamentals of the British economy are strong â wages are growing, employment is at a record high and we are forecast to grow faster than Germany, Italy and Japan this year,” Javid said in a statement.“The government is determined to provide certainty to people and businesses on Brexit \u0026nbspthat\u0027s why we are clear that the UK is leaving the EU on 31 October.”Here\u0027s the full story on the UK\u0027s unexpectedly poor economic performance from The Independent\u0027s business and economics editor, Olesya Dmitracova:\u0026nbspUK economy shrinks for first time since 2012 as fears of no-deal Brexit chaos mountThe pound is hovering perilously close to the 31-month low against the dollar of $1.208\u0026nbspit reached earlier this month.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s now at $1.2083...One bright spot in today\u0027s economic numbers was the continued resilience of British consumers.\u0026nbspSpending rose 0.5 per cent in the second quarter, although this was down slightly from 0.6 per cent in the previous three months.\u0026nbspConsumers have seen wages begin to rise above inflation in recent months.A British-West African industrial consortium has submitted a last-minute rescue offer to snap up the British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, the Press Association reports.\u0026nbspPA understands the unnamed industrial group has submitted a late bid to the government in an effort re-establish the international trade credentials of the site.\u0026nbspThe consortium, which involves a leading UK civil engineering company operating in West Africa, is the latest to enter the fray to take control of the steel supplier after it collapsed into liquidation 11 weeks ago.\u0026nbspMore on the potential impact of closure on Sconthorpe, here:\u0026nbspBritish Steel: Closure would ruin a historic industrial town and allow Britain to be ‘held to ransom’Package holiday firm On the Beach has blamed the plummeting pound foe a profit warning\u0026nbspissued today.\u0026nbspIt says\u0026nbspsterling\u0027s tumble\u0026nbspagainst the euro has forced it push up its holiday prices compared to competitors.\u0026nbspUnlike many of its rivals, On the Beach it does not hedge its exposure to currency changes.John McDonnell has seized on the latest GDP figures, which he says are a\u0026nbspdirect result of Tory incompetence.\u0026nbspThe Tories\u0027 Brexit bungling, including Boris Johnson now taking us towards no-deal, is breaking the economy.\u0026nbspMore on the reaction to today\u0027s numbers from political correspondent Ashley Cowburn:\u0026nbspBoris Johnson accused of \u0027breaking economy\u0027 over no-deal Brexit threats as recession fears mount\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAdvertising firm WPP led Friday\u0027s FTSE 100 firms as its shares jumped after it performed ahead of analyst predictions.\u0026nbspInvestors cheered the beleaguered firm\u0027s revenue performance as its major turnaround programme gathered pace in the second quarter. The company, which was left struggling after a string of client losses following Sir Martin Sorrell\u0027s exit last year, limited its revenue decline to 1.4 per cent\u0026nbspfor period.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPress AssociationThe pound is back to its lowest in more than two-and-a-half years against the dollar.\u0026nbspIt has fallen 0.5 per cent to $1.2067, a level last visited in January 2017.\u0026nbspAgainst the euro the pound has fallen\u0026nbspto a new two-year low of €1.078, down 0.7 per cent today.The FTSE 100 closed down 0.6 per cent to 7,242.79.\u0026nbspThe FTSE 250 index of mid-sized firms was down 0.3 per cent to 19,085.12.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTaken by itself, a 0.2 per cent contraction of UK GDP between April and June would not be a major concern, says Michael Kitson\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspan economics lecturer at Cambridge University.\u0026nbspBut the alarm bells should be ringing with the Office of National Statistics (ONS) alerting about a “slowing in the underlying figures” combined with concerns about the government’s economic policy.\u0026nbspEconomists are united by one thing in the wake of the troubling GDP figures: Brexit will make them worseOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The slide could be even steeper as the OBR’s prediction was based on the assumption of a particular type of no-deal Brexit – the less disruptive of the two laid out by the IMF earlier this year.Howard Archer, economic adviser to the EY Item\u0026nbspClub, forecasts a similar decline, saying house prices would quickly fall by about 5 per cent as the economy weakened and the market was mired in acute uncertainty over Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU.For now, house prices look on track for hardly any growth over this year.\u0026nbspAccording to RICS, a net balance of 9 per cent of respondents reported a fall in average prices over the past three months in England and Wales. Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the result is consistent with the official measure of prices showing a rise of only 0.5 per cent in 2019.\u0026nbspHalifax data also showed that UK house prices dropped slightly in July for the second consecutive month and now stand at £236,120 on average.“The market continues to tread water,” said Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax.\u0026nbsp“In the longer term, we believe there is unlikely to be a step change in market activity until buyers and sellers see some form of resolution to the current economic uncertainty.”RICS echoed this prediction, noting that its survey now points to zero growth in sales – as well as a steeper fall in prices – in the next three months.On Thursday Boris Johnson reiterated his trademark message that Britain will leave the EU on 31 October, even though no progress has been made on securing a withdrawal agreement acceptable to both sides.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

andnew Prime Minister Boris Johnson is likely to call a snap election.A General Election gives UK citizens a chance to select an MP to represent their local area in the House of Commons.Normally there will be several candidates, each from a dferent political party, standing to be the Member of Parliament in each constituency.The vote will also determine who will be elected as the UK Prime Minister.The last General Election was held on June , .Boris Johnson has absolutely ruled out calling a General Election before the Brexit deadline day of October .The new Prime Minister said an election is the last thing he wants as he visited a hospital in Lincolnshire after pledging to spend £.billion on the NHS.He also promised to spend £billion to recruit an extra , coppers as he pounded the beat in Birmingham.Johnson restated his commitment to take the UK out of the European Union on or before the deadline of Halloween this year.The PM said: The British people voted in , in , in . What they want us to do is deliver on their mandate, come out of the EU on October .However, in early August there was speculation that the new Conservative leader could take the country to the polls in a bid to consolidate his power base.If a snap election is called, Boris will battle it out to retain his title as PM.It would be a chance for him to understand how confident the British public are in his skills, as his current position as PM was voted for by members of the Conservative Party.A  General Election could see some big changes to the Conservative Party, as it looks like Tories may have to accept the possibility of a No Deal Brexit, and back that in Boris campaign.Johnson would run against Jeremy Corbyn, who lost out to Theresa May in  with  per cent of the UKs vote.However, voices from within and outside the Labour Party are allegedly urging Corbyn to quit as Labour experiences record slumps in polls in the wake of several anti-Semitism scandals.A number of Labour MPs have been rumoured to be gunning to take over from Corbyn in Labours leadership, most notably Londons Mayor Sadiq Khan.Jo Swinson, who took over Lib Dem leadership in July  would also run - Lib Dems currently stand on  per cent in the polls, their strongest result yet.The Scottish National Party , the Democratic Unionist Party , Sinn Fein, Plaid Cymru and Green are also very likely to run.Amid the Brexit drama, its likely that Farages Brexit Party could be contenders after Nigel Farage questioned Boris ability to deliver Brexit.The five MPs from Change UK, formerly The Independent Group, and fronted by Heidi Allen could stand for their new party in their constituencies but risk losing their seats.General Elections have to be held at least every five years in the UK.Previously elections could be called simply by the Prime Minister going to the Queen at any point within five years of the last one.But after the Fixed Term Parliament Act was passed in  the five-year gap was enshrined in law.The act states that General Elections are to be held on the first Thursday in May every five years.However, it has two provisos for the polls opening early.Firstly: A motion of no confidence passed in Her Majesty’s Government by a simple majority and  days elapses without the House passing a confidence motion in any new Government formed.And Secondly: A motion for a General Election is agreed by two thirds of the total number of seats in the Commons including vacant seats .The next General Election in the United Kingdom is scheduled to be held on May , , under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act .The date of the last General Election was June , , which saw the Conservatives lose their majority but remain in Government after they struck a deal with the DUP.The next General Election is scheduled for  - provided Boris Johnson doesnt call a snap election.A snap election could be calledthere is a Remainer revolt against a No Deal Brexit.Labour leader Corbyn has vowed to call a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnsons Government that could trigger an election.If a majority of MPS agree they have no confidence in Johnsons administration, then attempts can be made to form another regime either under Corbyn or a cross-party “government of national unity”.If no viable alternative can be found after  days, a general election is triggered – although Johnson would still get to set the date and could therefore hold the poll after taking the UK out of the EU.Askedhe was preparing to fight an election after losing a confidence vote, the Prime Minister insisted: “No. The answer is no.Britain isnt due a national election until .Theresa May called a shock snap election in  to try and strengthen the Conservatives hold on Parliament, but it backfired when her majority was slashed by  seats."},{"url":null,"title":"uk general election what bookies oods latest","story":"The inscrutable Tory bigwig could be wanting to bring a vote to the people shortly after a No Deal Brexit.

He also adds that: “I prefer a quiet le away from the day job.” And the band played Believe It If You Like.To recap: Paul is a master baker who caught a lucky break after being booked to appear on what became TV juggernaut The Great British Bake Off.Back then he was happily married to we Alex and, outside of an occasional media interview to plug the show, his home le never made the headlines.A bit of work and no play made Paul a dull boy when it came to clickbait. Then he had a fling with fellow TV chef Marcela Valladolid and all hell broke loose.Sex sells. It always has. So does scandal, and cheating on your we with a younger woman fits firmly into both categories.When the fling ended, the admirably forgiving Alex took Paul back, but the marriage faltered again and he took up with a -year-old barmaid with a fondness for miniskirts and crop tops.What’s not to love for the hundreds of “paparazzo”who make a living from how many times their photo gets viewed online It’s not rocket science, is it  Earlier this year I spotted Judi Dench out supermarket shopping.Yes, that Judi Dench. Dame of the British Empire. Oscar winner. Recipient of more awards than Mr Hollywood’s had hot buns.And favoured guest of chatshow host Graham Norton. But there she was, browsing the aisles and totally unbothered by anyone.Why  Well, firstly, she wasn’t wilfully drawing attention to herself by radiating self-importance. And secondly, while she’s paid to be dramatic on screen, her le outside of it is anything but.Meaning that, in everyday le, her showbiz currency — the aforementioned “clickbait” — is, depending on how you view such things, blissfully low.But , say, she decided to dump her conservationist partner David Mills for a young barman from her local pub, a photo of her low-key shopping trip would be front-page news. Simple really.Aside from the marvellous Ms Dench, there are oodles of A- listers who live non-famous lives, popping to the supermarket or going for a low-key dinner — for example, not The Ivy et al — with loved ones.Occasionally, they might be spotted and photographed, but they just keep their head down and ignore it, accepting that it’s a small price to pay for the myriad other benefits fame brings.NDAsare now commonly used by celebrities to ensure the silence of, say, a nanny who will be privy to what happens behind closed doors — and that’s perhaps understandable.But asking a lover to sign on the dotted line when you’ve already been together two years is saying, in so many words: “I don’t trust you, but I want to carry on sleeping with you.”Who can blame Summer for telling him to stick it where the sun don’t shine Famous US basketball coach and mentor, John Wooden , once said: “Talent is God given Be humble. Fame is man-given Be grateful. Conceit is self-given Be careful.”Wise words that Mr Hollywoodwould do well to heed.WHATEVER you think of Boris Johnson’s politics, it can’t be denied that he’s working his King Ashurbanipal socks offas our new PM.Hospitals, factories, flood-hit towns – you name it, he’s popping up there to put a smile on everyone’s face and reassure them that everything is under control.He’s the frontman while the rest of the bandare putting in the hours at the studio, hopefully producing the hits. Time will tell.But suffice to say, he’s already shaping up to be the UK’s cheerleader – a feat the more reserved and aloof Theresa May never quite managed.WHEN asked about children, Prince Harry replied that he and we Meghan might have “two, maximum”.Fair enough, I thought. After all, she’s  now and,she’s lucky, Mother Nature might let her conceive one more before her womb shuts shop.But no, it seems the royal couple’s decision is to do with population growth, despite experts saying that, globally, the birthrate is shrinking and the real issue is how long we’re all living.So unless he’s planning to pack Granny off to Dignitas, there’s not much he can do about it. But I digress.Regarding royal babies and, in particular, Harry and Meghan’s sensitivity around their firstborn’s privacy, perhaps they should copy his cousin Zara.She and husband Mike Tindall have two daughters, Mia, five, and Lena, one. There’s no showboating or churlishness, they just give their daughters as normal a le as possible via picnics, getting muddy, painting faces and rough and tumble – as seen in thisdelightful photo of mischievous Mia hitching a ride on Dad’s back.They occasionally get photographed, but clearly accept that it’s just one of those things and don’t let it bother them. A parenting template to be admired, whoever you are.THE author Alex Elle once said: “I am very cautious of people whose actions don’t match their words.”In which case, let’s hope she wasn’t invited to the recent Google Camp party in Sicily which,you’re one of the self-regarding A-listers in attendance, was a high-minded gathering to discuss the issue of climate change.Or to the rest of us – a boondoggle for entitled fools. How  to describe an event attended by  of some of the world’s richest people who arrived on eco-unfriendly private jets and luxury yachts Oh, the unacknowledged irony. Meanwhile, Leona Lewis and ious other celebrities, who advocate gun control, happily took a shilling or three to attend the Austria-based party of Gaston Glock – one of the world’s most famous gun makers.But back to Google Camp where – and I can’t quite believe I’m writing this – residents and hotel guests near the archaeological site of Selinunte were told by police to avoid looking out of their windows to protect the privacy of the invited A-listers dining al fresco.The same slebs, one assumes, who regularly virtue signal their moral credentials by advocating a world without borders, where everyone should be treated the same . . . yada yada.

But things aren’t quite working out that way.While the UK economy is far from booming, it is holding up much better than those in the Eurozone. Figures released yesterday show Germany’s manufacturing sector contracted by . per cent in July and is now a shocking . per cent smaller than it was a year ago.Given the importance of manufacturing to the German economy, it is likely the whole economy is now heading for recession — a fate the country only narrowly avoided at the end of last year.In Italy, too, economic growth has ground to a halt again — after the country only just hauled itself out of last year’s recession. In France, growth in the past three months fell to . per cent.By contrast, our economy looks relatively perky, with growth of . per cent in the three months to May. Figures released on Monday showed a rebound in confidence in the dominant services sector.Of the large Eurozone countries, only Spain is currently outgrowing us — but Spain is still recovering after a very deep recession from which it emerged in . In common with Italy, the Spanish economy is still smaller than it was before the - banking crisis.Not that you will hear any of this from Remainers. Every time a car factory is earmarked for closure or a steelworks runs into problems, we hear no end of people saying, “We told you so”.All bad news in the UK economy is automatically attributed to Brexit — on the BBC, especially. What we don’t hear is that manufacturing industries, especially cars and steel, are suffering the same problems across Europe.Germany’s car industry is still reeling from the scandal of Volkswagen cheating in emissions tests by installing software to detect when a car was in test mode.On top of that comes the proposed switch from petrol and diesel to electric cars. Many motorists — myself included — have put off buying new vehicles because we don’t know what to get.We have been told new petrol and diesel cars will be banned from  and worry they might be taxed out of existence well before then. Yet electric cars are still prohibitively expensive and can’t travel nearly far enough between charges.As for the steel industry, all across Europe it is struggling to compete with cheap competition from China — especially since the trade war with the US forced Chinese exporters to search for new markets away from America.Of course,we end up with a No-Deal Brexit and tarfs are imposed on imports and exports between Britain and the EU, it will cause some disruption to trade. But it is wrong to assume Britain will come off worse. In truth, EU exporters have more to lose. Britain runs a huge trade deficit with the EU.In  we exported £billion worth of goods and services to other EU countries and imported £billion from them — a trade gap of £billion. Moreover, EU exports to Britain are concentrated in products that attract relatively high tarfs.Cars, for example, attract an EU import tarf of ten per cent. If Britain chooses to impose that levy in reverse after Brexit, it will cause further mayhem in the German car industry.We also have a high deficit in food — which under EU rules attracts average tarfs of  per cent. For dairy products, the average EU import tarf is  per cent. If our Government decides to impose this on imports from the EU, it will mean the end of quite a few French cheese producers.Of course, the EU can avoid damaging these export industries by agreeing to a trade deal with the UK — one that doesn’t include the hated Irish backstop.Nearly half of Irish food exports go to the UK. Irish exports to other EU countries would be deeply affected as so many rely on UK roads. If there are delays at ports, traffic between Ireland and the Continent will suffer twice over — once crossing the Irish Sea then crossing the English Channel.EU leaders want to punish Britain for voting to leave their sacred project. They fear thatBritain is seen to do well, other countries will want to leave. But playing hardball with Britain will do deep harm to their own export industries.Does German chancellor Angela Merkel want to suffer the wrath of her country’s car makers  Does French president Emmanuel Macron wish to anger winemakers already struggling with an economic downturn at home A hard Brexit could cost Denmark as much as one per cent in lost gross domestic product. Their former economy minister Simon Emil Ammitzboll calls Brexit “the most visible threat to the Danish economy”.Holland and Belgium calculate similar falls will hit their economies, with the Dutch losing ten billion euros by . In Spain, wages for unskilled youths are lower than they were in the late s. Youth unemployment is a huge problem. Even qualied youths face a lower annual salary than their counterparts a decade ago.The alternative to all this is for the EU to swallow a bit of pride and agree to keep free trade flowing, perhaps via a temporary deal while long-term arrangements are negotiated.It won’t take much. Just remove the backstop — really just an underhand way of trying to keep Britain in the straitjacket of EU regulations and trade barriers — and some kind of withdrawal agreement would almost certainly make it through the Commons.If not, then yes, British industry will suffer in some ways from No Deal. But the Eurozone economies already lagging behind will take the bigger hit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

With Theresa May, it never was. Brussels knew she didn’t even want to leave, never mind with No Deal.And whenever No Deal was threatened there would always be some helpful soul in her Cabinet to say . . . “That will never happen.”  People such as the treacherous Philip Hammond.Not any more. Second, he’s shaking up the civil service a bit.  It was civil servants who did most of the negotiating — and they are all wildly pro Remain.But with Boris’s adviser Dominic Cummings wielding the stick they might just be a little more amenable than before.Third — he’s realised that the bloody Northern Ireland backstop was never anywhere near so serious an impediment as the Remainersclaimed.And fourth, and maybe most importantly, he’s leading the country with a sense of optimism and chutzpah.Of course it’s Boris, so he may well do something totally bonkers and wreck the process. But so far he’s got everything right.He hasn’t got long to sort out a deal, the days are counting down. But my guess is that he WILL get one.The EU likes to talk a hard game but it usually budges in the end. It is desperate to avoid No Deal.Andit doesn’t budge — fine. A bumpy road for a few weeks and we’ll be OK, better off than ever. And free. The big threat to Brexit is not the EU — it’s our Parliament, once again.The Labour Party has ditched all semblance of principle and is now for a second referendum.Worse, Boris has a majority of only one. That’s not his fault — blame Theresa May for calling an election two years ago.It looks to me thatMagic Grandpa Jeremy Corbyn calls a vote of no confidence, he will probably win.Labour is already cosying up to the Scottish Nationalists and saying they wouldn’t mind a second referendum on independence.There is now nothing Labour wouldn’t do to gain power. Destroy the union and scupper Brexit — Magic Grandpa doesn’t care.Butthis whole thing ends with Labour des- troying Brexit, the party will never be trusted again.Oh sure, it will still get the votes from the metropolitan, middle-class lefties. But its working-class base will desert it, for good.So the message for Magic Grandpa is very clear. Win your vote of confidence, lose your voters. He’s not the brightest of men, but I do hope he grasps this.And Boris  Keep straight ahead. Play as hardball as possible with Brussels, knowing they want a deal. Strike as many deals with the likes of the USA and Canada as possible.And remind Brussels thatwe walk away without a deal, they don’t get a single penny from us. That should help to concentrate their minds for a while.This has been revealed in a new report by researchers with too much time on their hands. What these men want, I think, is the best of both worlds.I used to have a girlfriend who spent all day long sitting on the roof of the shed. Then she’d dart out into the road after a thrush. She was great.Had a little bell around her neck. And did her business in a small tray by the back door.A WOMAN in East London said nasty things to someone taking part in a gay Pride march. She was wearing a niqab, so the lefties didn’t get too cross.Still, it is at last beginning to dawn on the woke liberals that the more fervently Muslim a person may be, the less likely it is that he or she will take kindly to people who have a knack for interior design and enjoy watching Mamma Mia!.This has put them in a bit of a quandary. Much as have those largely Muslim protests outside schools in the Midlands which insist on teaching kids how wonderful gay relationships might be.The same sort of quandary that affects feminists, who are not entirely convinced that a ft chap with a todger and a beard who wishes to be called “Loretta” in the name of gender freedom actually is a woman.This is the thing with identity politics, protected characteristics and so on. Tug gently on one of its threads and the whole thing begins to unravel like a pink mohair jumper knitted by an imbecile. HERE’S some consol­ation for you cricket fans, in despair at our Ashes defeat. Steve Smith, the man who did most of the damage, is at least HALF English.He’s got an English mum and has dual nationality.He used to play cricket for a team in Sevenoaks, in Kent.So what we should do is ide his run total down the middle – we get half, the Aussies get half.

They voted to leave the EU. The only problem, as we have since discovered, is that many MPs don’t share the Queen’s trust in the judgment of the British people. Rather than respect the decision, they have sought to overturn it.Given their lack of respect for the British people, it is perhaps not surprising to see their total lack of respect for our Monarch and our long political traditions. It is not the job of hard-Left politicians or Remainer MPs to decide what the Queen should or should not do.The only person from whom the Queen can take constitutionally binding advice is the Prime Minister. Should Boris Johnson lose a vote of no confidence then the Queen will be advised by her outgoing Prime Minister about who can or cannot command the confidence of the House of Commons.Further, as Prime Minister, it would be up to Mr Johnson to advise the Queen on whether to give Royal Assent to a Bill passed by the Commons and Lords blocking a No-Deal Brexit. It would be well within his rights to advise the Queen not to sign such a bill into law.Were Johnson to seek to remain after  days without calling an election, he would be breaking the law, and it would then be for the courts, not the Queen, to intervene.It is certainly possible in theory that the sovereign could be called upon to choose between two rival claims to form a government. However, this would be regarded as highly political and has not been done since .In reality, it is far more likely that the numbers in Parliament will tell us who does or does not have a majority, and that a general election will be called before getting the Queen involved.We all know what this is really about, though. The vote for Brexit was always destined to bring us to a constitutional crisis. It was the first moment in our country’s long and proud history when a majority of people outside of Parliament asked for something that a majority of people inside Parliament did not want to give.The right way through this mess is not to drag the Queen into politics but to deliver on the decision that was made by the British people more than three years ago.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For the sake of their Parliamentary careers, most of them keep quiet.But there are also deeper factors at work.One is mainstream Labour’s horror at any supposed betrayal of the socialist cause.This is partly because Labour is such a tribal movement, as shown in the ferocious anger generated in  by Ramsay MacDonald’s decision to break with the party by forming a National Government with the despised Tories.Since then treachery is regarded as the greatest sin, far worse than incompetence or unpopularity.This trait particularly insulates Corbyn, who, for all his spectacular failings, is still regarded by the majority of the membership as an authentic socialist.There is also a deep streak of sentimentality in Labour, which stems from the party’s origins in the trade union movement.In this mindset of supposed compassion, sacking people is what the bosses do, not the workers.When the nondescript Clement Attlee was surprisingly elected Labour leader in , supporters of his rival Herbert Morrison tried to comfort him by saying Attlee’s spell at the top would be short-lived.Morrison was having none of it.The party, he said, was sentimental and having once made a man leader, would stick to him.He was right. Attlee was still in post  years later.Sentimentality explains why so many anti-leadership plots are botched.I saw this for myself working as a Labour researcher at Westminster in the late s and early s, when there were hidden manoeuvres against Kinnock.But they all came to nothing because the plotters lacked the determination to finish the job.The same was true during Gordon Brown’s woeful premiership, when conspirators abandoned the battle when the moment came to strike.More interested in dogma than office, the Labour party lacks the unsparing instinct for power that infuses the Tories, which helps to explain why the Conservatives have been in Government for twice as long. Since  , the Tories have been in office for  years and Labour for just .The absence of hard ambition means that socialists are willing to put up with a dud like Corbyn, while they mouth their slogans and wave the red flag."},{"url":null,"title":"brussels chiefs want showdown with boris but order him to keep the backstop first if he wants better deal before october 31","story":"The European Commission said the Withdrawal Agreement was “not up for negotiation” in a statement today.“And of course we are willing to talk and engage with Prime Minister Johnson.”The PM has so far refused to hold talks with EU chiefs and will not compromise on his stance against Theresa May’s hated deal.He has previously warned thatthe EU dont budge on getting rid of the backstop, it will be their choice to push Britain out of the bloc without an agreement by October .The backstop, which would come into playa future trading arrangement falls short of keeping the border open, has been the main stumbling block on Brexit negotiations.However, Andreeva said it was not the Commission’s “business” to play a “blame game”.She added: “Our business is to prepare for a no deal.“Both sides negotiated with the very best intentions and the very best efforts.

You’ve seen him, even though you’re not supposed to as he prides himself on working in the shadows. He’s the one who looks like a constipated Gollum wearing a T-shirt he’s nicked off a teenage intern.Someone bullied at school for being an uppity nerd who spent his adult le in a bedsit plotting how to detonate a bomb at his classmates’ reunion.    The Leave mastermind who won the referendum vote by training people to shout “take back control”, “let’s give £m a week to the NHS” and “the dirty Turks will take your jobs”. Although the mastermind had no idea what to do once the vote had been won, which is why the hapless Leave crew have parachuted him back in and he’s now training them to shout, “politicians don’t get to choose which votes they respect”. Good news though. The elitist-hating Oxford graduate, who’s married to a baronet’s daughter, has come up with a cunning plan which involves Johnson refusing to resign after losing a no-confidence vote in the Commons and squatting in Downing Street until a no-deal Brexit is done. And although constitutional experts say the Queen could “dispense with his services”, Cummings is betting there’s no chance of that because she never interferes in politics.    Like a crinoline toilet roll doll, she merely sits there for decoration. But can he be sure  I’m not the Queen’s biggest fan, butshe sees her authority questioned and her country at war, who’s to say she won’t hatch her own cunning plan One that smacks down two-bit opportunists such as Johnson and Cummings and strikes back at hardened Republicans like me who see the royals as pointless, palace-dwelling parasites."},{"url":null,"title":"brit accused running over pedestrians","story":"NewsBrit accused of running over pedestrians near Costa del Sol beach faces trialMarcus Stewart, , from Coventry, was arrested by an armed police officer after the incident on Marbellas famous Golden MileShareByGerard Couzens:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video costa-del-sol-hit-run-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA British man arrested after several pedestrians were mown down near a celeb Costa del Sol beach club is set to go on trial. Marcus Stewart, , from Coventry, was arrested by an armed policeman on the beach after a head-on crash on Marbella’s famous Golden Mile with a car carrying an -day-old baby. Footage of the arrest shows Stewart being frogmarched away from the sand barefoot in just a pair of shorts, an officer walking behind him with his gun in his hand. Spanish state prosecutors have charged Stewart with one count of reckless driving, nine counts of wounding and one count of damage.  Prosecutors are also seeking just over £, in compensation for the nine people injured in the May ,  incident. They include the pedestrians hurt outside the Ocean Club in Puerto Banus and others injured when the Audi Q Stewart was in crashed after a police chase. No charges have been brought against a second Brit held in the drama, named at the time as Liam O’Neill, , from Walsgrave near Coventry, and identied by police as a passenger in the Audi. He is no longer a suspect. Stewart is accused in a nine-page indictment of getting behind the wheel despite taking cocaine and being over the Spanish drink-drive limit. Prosecutors say he got in the Audi belonging to a friend after a fight as he left the Ocean Club and “conscious of the danger and with absolute contempt for the lives of pedestrians, accelerated at great speed on a walkway against people who were leaving the establishment.”  One of his alleged victims was hit from behind before Stewart “sparked panic among people there, forcing them to flee to avoid being run over because there was nowhere for them to take cover” according to the prosecution document. Stewart was held a couple of miles away after a crash at the end of a high-speed police chase which ended with him smashing head-on into a Skoda. The days-old baby travelling with her mum and dad in the other vehicle survived unharmed but the family’s pet Yorkshire Terrier called Nina died. Stewart was found to be twice over the Spanish drink-drive limit when he was breathalysed.Cocaine was also detected in his bloodstream during tests, according to police. Marbella’s then-mayor Jose Bernal said in the aftermath of the drama the incident was sparked by an altercation at the Ocean Club after an annual champagne party there attended by the two suspects. He was forced to make a defence of the area at a press conference by insisting “Marbella is a safe place and when isolated incidents like this occur, the emergency services and forces of law and order have shown they act immediately and efficiently.” He branded the two Brits involved as two drunks on drugs who had a fight in a club got in a car and ended up running over three people who thankfully survived.

Seven-year-old Cameron Wahid, of East Grinstead, West Sussex, went into anaphylactic shock after having spaghetti containing dairy products on a family holiday in Sorrento, Italy, in . Dad Riz, who now lives in Dubai, said: To tweet about what someone  has is totally unecessary. In terms of the point that heaposs asking people to tell them beforehand, I get that. But then to turn it into a bit of mockery on Twitter, itaposs just uncalled for. The words he chose could have been a lot more sophisticated. He added: Itaposs a stupid tweet, itaposs a naive tweet. Obviously I think he needs to sit down with some people who go through very hard times or people with allergies so he understands their le.  And Julianne Ponan, , whose severe allergies inspired her to set up Creative Nature Superfoods, which offers products free from additives, nuts and seeds, slammed the chef. She said: You canapost change your allergies. I think itaposs awful that someone would so dismissive and publicly shame someone over their intolerances. I already feel like an inconvenience when I have to inform restaurants about my multiple allergies, I donapost expect the chef to then tweet about it.  Especially when youaposre going out for a really nice restaurant, they should be able to accommodate you without making a fuss about it on social media. On Twitter, the official account for Chez Bruce, in Wandsworth, southwest London, added: “One has sympathies for guests with allergies food intolerances. “But handing us a list like this without prior notice is hardly the most sensible way of ensuring that we are able to do our best to cater for them. “Good luck with that in most other restaurants!”  In response to the chefaposs post, Andrew Stevenson tweeted: “While I sympathise with people with real allergies and intolerances, this looks like silly faddiness and just trying to make your le dficult. “And I find it dficult to believe that theyaposre allergic to tomatoes, but are ok with potatoes and aubergines.”And a Twitter account run for posh pub Abbot’s Elm, in Abbots Ripton, Cambridegshire, scathingly dubbed it “attention seeking.”But on Twitter, Julie Andrews added: As someone with multiple GENUINE le threatening food allergiesthis is worrying. And Freya said: This looks like a list from someone who might be struggling with an inflammatory bowel condition. While some advance notice should absolutely be given it’s a real shame to see so much mockery and lack of understanding in the comments.  Holborn Dining Roomaposs executive chef Calum Franklin said diners needed to ring ahead so kitchens could prepare. He said: I think my major problem with this is the unannounced part of it. “If you have this many allergies honestly it must be really c*** and I do really feel sorry for you but help restaurants out with a bit of pre warning and they will look after you so well. “Just dropping it on the night causes havoc in kitchens, which are usually set up to deal with a couple of allergies and options but this many makes things complicated and affects the experience of everyone around you as chefs scramble around trying to create a new menu for you. If you are then rude to the staff whilst they are trying to accommodate these requests in the middle of a full service thataposs pretty inconsiderate and you need to do a bit of one on one mirror time in the morning. “We often get emails from guests who have lists longer than this and do you know what, we enjoy planning a menu for them. “Itaposs a challenge and we want to make sure they feel very well looked after but thataposs only possible with a bit of notice.”    After removing his tweets this morning, Mr Christmas added: Deleted my allergy tweet. For the record I just wished to highlight the benefit of letting restaurants know in advance of any dietary requirements, that way we can better look after you on the day with more options. I have the utmost respect for diners with genuine allergies. Also, when I said anyone would struggle to deal with it professionally, I meant with the standards of hospitality that we endeavour to deliver to every guest, in no way was it a reference to the preparation of the food.

Enid Malcolmaposs home was closed by the courts for three month in a bid to stop the violence, disorder and nuisance affecting her neighbours in Leicester. Compelling evidence said the house was being used to deal class A drugs and Leicester City Council claimed Mrs Malcolm was aware of the drug dealing and was involved in it. The -year-old pensioner had lived and raised her family in the three-bedroom end terraced house, Leicestershire Live reports and she said sheaposd rather sleep in a bus shelter than the alternatives the council has offered. The council has offered Mrs Malcolm three alternative properties nearby and she has refused them all.  “I’ve seen it, she said. You wouldn’t put a dog in it. It’s a house but it’s not a home. “I’ll sleep in the bus stop tonight rather than let them put me in there. “I’m so upset. All I want to do is stay in my home where I lived with my husband. I’m too old for this. Theyaposve said Iaposm a drug dealer - that I wash crack.  I donapost even know what that means.Someoneaposs trying to stitch me up. Magistrates heard yesterday that problems began at the property in  after Mrs Malcolm’s husband Polones died. The council and the police said the problems were caused by her son George Malcolm, , and her cousin, Clyde Wallace, who were living with her. However the council also said Ms Malcolm was aware of the drug dealing and was involved in it. She denies this and sat in court shaking her head and loudly tutting as the evidence was presented. Vivienne Sedgley, representing, the council said: “The council’s case is that there is drug dealing taking place at the property. “The activities were taking place every day at all hours of the day and there is a serious problem in relation to the property. She said there had been reports of visitors to the house putting money through the letter box and being thrown drugs from a window.    She told the court: “You may wonder why no residents are here to give evidence. “They are afraidthey put their heads above the parapet that might make things very dficulty and uncomfortable. “Without a three month closure order the behaviour is simply going to continue.” The court was told police had executed three warrants at the property since , which led to the recovery of drugs, knives and large sums of cash. The warrants also led to a number of arrests and the conviction of Ms Malcolmaposs grandson Andre Alexis for possession with intent to supply. Mrs Malcolm was present on two of those occasions, though she was not arrested. The council argues she was part of the drug dealing operation and would accept the money to buy drugs, while ‘washing the crack’.    Ms Sedgley said the police believed she had acted as a look out for a drug deal in the street near her home and had once paid a refund to a buyer who was not satisfied with their purchase. Ms Sedgley said: “Mrs Malcolm has at least a level of awareness of what is going on. “She is a very capable woman who cares very much for her son George and her cousin Clyde who she says is like son to her. “She simply must know what is going on.” PC Mark Bailey, giving evidence, said the police initially treated her as a vulnerable person – as they would a domestic violence victim. Her solicitor Nigel Hallchurch said this was not true. He said: “There is nothing to suggest she had anything to do with what went on. “There are just vague allegations with no evidence.” He did not call his client to give evidence, but spoke about her statement to the police. He said: “She refers that she is not involved in any drug dealing, she doesn’t wash the crack, she hasn’t taken any money from anyone and she is not a look out.” Ms Sedgley told magistrates that to grant the closure order they needed only to be convinced that there was someone, not necessarily Mrs Malcolm, committing criminal activity at the house.

The Brainy Dogs scheme has created more than  le-changing new friendships to date, while giving offenders the chance to learn new skills. Now the National Lottery-funded project, the only one of its kind in the UK, is a finalist in the th Birthday National Lottery Awards, where you can help choose the winners. Brainy Dogs, which is run by the charity Headway Suffolk, is expanding to include one-to-one pet therapy sessions for clients who are not suitable for a companion dog and care home visits.  It is also offering people on probation, veterans, those with mental health problems and children excluded from school opportunities to train the animals. Headway Suffolk chief executive Helen Fairweather says: “Companion dogs can make a real dference to someone who is living with a neurological condition. “Their disabilities can often be hidden and may leave them with a personality change or dficulties that mean they lose friends and their families struggle to support them. “A dog can fill this void and provide help, comfort and confidence as they attempt to navigate le.” The charity boss came up with the unique scheme after reading a book about an assistance dog who aided the recovery of a brain-injured man and then watching a programme about prisoners in Australia training dogs. She realised that many of the people Headway works with could benefit from a similar furry friend. Many are not eligible to receive a dog from other charitable organisations as they are not regarded as having adequate need. Helen teamed up with Blue Cross Felixstowe and HMP Hollesley Bay in Suffolk for a one-year pilot in  and the concept has gone from strength to strength, receiving a £, grant from the National Lottery last year to expand. Brainy Dogs Coordinator Sophie Wellum-Mayes says training is inidual to each dog and client, taking around eight weeks.  Volunteer trainers gain work experience, le skills and improved confidence, along with improving the futures of the dogs and their new owners. She says: “The dogs calm clients in a way humans cannot. They do not judge and for many people, this is a rare feeling. “We have been told that the dogs are a leline, they have stopped a couple of clients from ending their lives. “They get people out into social networks, give them a sense of normality and something in common with others. There are similar emotional and confidence benefits for the trainers too.” The National Lottery Awards are an annual celebration of the UK’s best National Lottery-funded projects, with this year marking  years since the first draw. The winners will receive £, towards their extraordinary work and appear on a star-studded BBC One show in November. Voting is now open in five categories.

After being diagnosed in May, doctors believe her condition is caused by a connective tissue disorder.    Rachelaposs collagen quota - the bodyaposs most abundant protein and major component of connective tissues - is not as high as it should be. She said: My neck has become too unstable to support the weight of my head, meaning I have to take extreme care. I can only wear my neck brace for four hours a day, because of the risk of muscles wasting away, which will be even more dangerous. I try to avoid turning from side-to-side. I can’t move to the left side. But the decapitation risk will go after the surgery, eventhere is still some pain. I’m desperate to get to Barcelona and have it done. It might not get rid of all my symptoms, but it will save my le. Until August  Rachel was fit and health but then she started a new medication for an overactive immune system. She had to be hospitalised three times between September and October that year because of extreme vomiting. Rachel lost two stone in just six weeks. She said: I couldn’t move off the couch. Even though I had stopped taking the medication pretty much straight away, the symptoms continued. I was back and forth to the hospital and I thought I could have an eating disorder, because I couldn’t get to the bottom of it.    My wedding to Guy was coming up in February  and I was thinking maybe I was subconsciously trying to lose weight for that. In October , after an MRI scan ruled out a pituitary tumour, Rachel was diagnosed with Addison’s disease, a rare disorder of the adrenal glands where they stop producing enough of the hormones cortisol and aldosterone. Treated with steroids,cortisol levels fall signicantly, it can cause a fatal adrenal crisis. She said: I was taking a lot of steroids but still losing weight. My wedding dress had to be taken in from a size  to a size six. I was having tremors in my hands, caused by adrenalin, I was exhausted all the time and would just fall asleep at any moment. It got to the point where I could not drive my daughter to school in case I fell asleep at the wheel. In August  we moved closer to my work and my daughter’s school, so I did not have to drive as far. But after she hit her head on a ceiling fan while moving into her new home in August last year, her symptoms got even worse. Rachel said: A week after that I went into adrenal crisis due to water retention and was admitted to hospital. It happened again a week later and I was back to hospital. After I ed home I was in constant pain. My head felt really heavy on my shoulders and I would get dizzy and lightheaded.  I started researching myself and came up with postural tachycardia syndromewhich is an abnormal increase in heart rate that occurs after sitting up or standing, causing dizziness amongst other things. She booked to see a private endocrinologist - a specialist treating problems with hormones - in the autumn  and had an MRI scan, which came back clear. After more visits to the GP she was referred to a cardiologist in March. An electrocardiogram test to check the heart’s rhythm showed she was tachycardic – meaning her heart was beating faster than normal while at rest - and then a tilt table test led to an official diagnosis of PoTS. Rachel said: PoTs is a secondary condition and is not caused by Addison’s, so I knew it must have been caused by something . In May  a neurologist also diagnosed her with Chiari malformation, a non-le threatening condition, where the lower part of the brain pushes down into the spinal canal, according to the NHS. Rachel said: I posted my MRI scan in a Chiari malformation Facebook group and people were commenting, saying Chiari was the least of my problems. The dizziness was getting worse. It felt my head was too heavy for my neck. At work I would have to prop up my head with my hands. It felt like an enormous weight. I couldn’t hold it myself.  I was getting really bad headaches. The worst was at the bottom of my head. It felt like something was pushing and going to pierce through my head. Sitting up would be agony. It would last for hours. It was totally debilitating. I could not physically stand up. My legs would just give way and in the end we had to hire a mobility scooter for me.” In June  Rachel saw another neurologist, who diagnosed her with platybasia, a flattening of the skull base, and basilar invagination, an infolding of the base of the skull, which occurs when one of the vertebra migrates upwards. Then paying £, for a private upright MRI scan, Rachel asked for the images be sent to Dr Gilete, a top neurosurgeon she had found via a Facebook group in Barcelona, Spain - one of only three experts worldwide dealing with minimal invasive spinal surgery techniques. Having assessed the MRI and carried out a detailed questionnaire, he added to her diagnosis atlantoaxial instability - where the vertebrae holding her skull in place become unstable and dislocated, hydrocephalus, which is an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid within the brain, scoliosis, a curvature of the spine, and cervical medullary syndrome, which is caused by brain stem compression. Luckily, a private health policy she has through work has covered a lot of her costs, but Rachel has still spent almost £, of her own money on consultations. And now she wants the surgery that could save her le.  Rachel said: I will have to have two operations. The first will remove the odontoid bone which is compressing my brain stem and the second a week later will fuse my skull and neck together. I will have a three week stay in hospital and then three weeks in an apartment with nurses. I just want to have it done as soon as possible. No one really knows whataposs caused it. I still wonderitaposs connected to my reaction to the new medication I took for an overactive immune system. I feel I have missed out on so much. I can’t go to my daughter’s assemblies and parentsapos evenings. I tried to go and was walking to a classroom when my legs gave way and I fell into the printer. If Iaposd banged my head it does not bear thinking about what might have happened. I hardly sleep. I can’t go out really. A trip to the supermarket is a day out for us. Rachel has praised her husband for his unerring support during her health crisis. She said: I do not know what I would do without Guy. I have had a lot of time off and it’s been a struggle, but he has been fantastic and tried to keep a bit of normality. Meanwhile, Guy lives in constant fear that his we could be taken from him.

Amanda, who lives just outside Hull, was initially told by her former employer she would have to take time off as holidayshe wanted to attend chemotherapy sessions at hospital.The -year-old, who was diagnosed with stage  breast cancer in , was granted a week off on sick leave to have the cancerous tumour removed, Hull Live reports.However, when the mum-of-three started treatment later that same year, she was stunned when bosses told her she would have to use her annual leave to go to gruelling chemotherapy sessions. Amanda said: “I got taken into an office and my manager basically said to meyou want to go to chemo you’re going to have to take it off as holiday. “After they told me I went back to work and worked in between my chemotherapy sessions so I didn’t lose any pay. I was a single mum and I couldn’t afford to lose any more money. “I had six rounds of chemo and when it go to the last one they docked my pay because I’d ran out of holiday.  “I was really upset but I didn’t want to lose my job. At the end of day getting cancer was not my fault and it wasn’t asI was going on holiday.” Amanda also had radiotherapy at the same time but it was the effects of the chemotherapy that left her struggling to cope in the workplace. She said: “Chemo is a lot stronger than radiotherapy and I ended up losing my hair. I had nine bags of fluid inside me every time I had chemo and there is no way I could have worked. “It made me feel drowsy and it was like I’d drank six bottles of vodka. I would be off my feet for a week then I’d wake up and be alright so I’d go to work for two weeks then I’d have the next round of chemo. “It was tiring and exhausting but I couldn’t afford to go on statutory sick pay because I had two children to provide for.” After having her pay docked, Amanda found herself struggling around Christmas and was unable to buy presents for her children, who were  and  at the time. However, after seeking help through Macmillan, she received a grant of £ to helped relieve her financial burden. The chemotherapy and radiotherapy helped rid Amanda of cancer and at the end of  she ed to full-time work. However, she became disillusioned with her employers and quit her job to take up a new position with a multinational firm. She still had to go to hospital three times a week for several months but Amanda says her new managers gave her much more support as well as time off to attend appointments.    “I went back to work but I didn’t like the company after what they did to me,” Amanda said. “I did my best to look for another job and I left by the same Christmas after handing in my notice. “I lost all respect for them so I moved to another company and I’ve been with them ever since. When I needed an operation to have reconstructive surgery they gave me five weeks’ full pay and they said they would do everything they could to support me.” The Hull company which put Amanda through her ordeal has since folded after going into administration and Amanda did not want the firm to be named. She became inspired to tell her story after reading about Mark Ash, who was sacked during his battle with cancer.

Bryan Adams later ­recorded Summer of ‘, with the words, “I’d always wanna be there Those were the best days of my le”. It seemed like the long glorious summer of love and freedom would never end. Fate had other ideas, and the signs were already there... The Isle of Wight pop festival – Britain’s answer to Woodstock – inspired a generation of music lovers. But The Beatles, icons of the decade, were falling apart. This razzmatazz summer is remembered for the Moon landing, not for a fatal fallout between Labour premier Harold Wilson and the unions. America was still a beacon of hope, but the murder of Sharon Tate and her unborn child by the Charles Manson gang revealed its dark side.    In Northern Ireland, the civil rights movement was growing, but a loyalist backlash was about to spark  bloody years of the ­Troubles. And it was when the first stirrings of revolt were felt among the nation’s badly treated coal miners, leading to the insurrectionary Great Strike for Jobs  years later. All the ingredients of the grim s and the Thatcherite revolution of the following decade were there,only we could have seen them. I was there, and I didn’t. And supposedly wiser men than me failed to grasp the shting of the tectonic plates right under our feet. We paid for our myopia. Butnot “the best”, they were good days all right. I was the London-based industrial correspondent of the Sheffield Morning , working my notice to join The Times. Fleet Street was still jumpin’: boisterous and hard-drinking, asthe magic roundabout would never stop. We were living in a rented semi in Kingsbury, in North West London, on the Bakerloo line, which ran by the bottom of our garden. Our daughters had just started primary school. I was earning £,. A year, not a month. Obviously, le was a lot cheaper, too. Some of it, at any rate.    Beer was p a pint, a loaf of bread cost p. Wine was a quid a bottle, whisky less than £, and fags p for . The average house cost £, – but double that in the capital. The average car cost £,. We had neither, and we didn’t even have a proper stove but we had finally got a telly. Black and white. We illegally sub-let the upstairs to two lads from the now-defunct London Evening News. And we still had parties. High summer had started so well. The ­nation was gripped by the splendour of Prince Charles’s investiture as Prince of Wales in ­Caernarfon castle. Months later, he began his affair with Camilla – long before meeting Diana. Under legendary manager Don Revie, Leeds United had won the football league for the first time, six points ahead of Liverpool, with iconic players such as Bremner, Charlton, Hunter, Giles, Gray and Lorimer in the side, and across the city Leeds were also the rugby league champions.  The Beatles made their famous photocall walk over a pedestrian crossing in Abbey Road. They were on their way to recording their last album together – the end of a musical era. They sang “Come Together” but they were drting apart.From across the Atlantic, Richard Nixon made history with the first visit by a US president to a communist country – Romania, groaning under the heel of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, a  start to international detente. On August , cult leader Manson and his drug-crazed gang murdered five people, including Roman Polanski’s eight-months pregnant we Sharon Tate, in her Los Angeles home, a crime that reverberates today. A few days later, Mick Jagger was accidentally shot while filming the biopic of outlaw Ned Kelly in Australia. He survived, unlike Rolling Stones founder Brian Jones, who had died mysteriously weeks before in a Sussex farmhouse swimming pool. Mick and Marianne Faithfull didn’t attend the funeral, claiming their contracts permitted no delay in their travel Down Under. On the th, British troops were deployed for the first time in Northern Ireland. It was to be “a limited operation” of  soldiers of the Ist Battalion, Prince of Wales’s Own Regiment of ­Yorkshire, to restore law and order in the rioting area of Bogside, Derry.  At first, they were cheered in the streets by Catholic residents, but the mood swtly changed and the Provisional IRA began a war of terror that was to cost , lives, more than half of them civilians. British politicians lethally ­underestimated the powerful tribal, religious and secessionist forces at work. There are still , British soldiers in the province, down from a peak in the s of ,. Over the pond, it was music mayhem. On the th, , young people attended Woodstock in New York to hear Ravi Shankar, Joan Baez, the Grateful Dead , Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin. Three days later, a fan died from heroin overdose, an occurrence that would become all too familiar. On the st, legendary boxer Rocky Marciano died in a plane crash over Iowa, on the eve of his th birthday. These were the events that hit the ­headlines. Under the radar, Henry ­Kissinger began secret talks in Paris to end the Vietnam War. They soon foundered. This was the month of the first US Army mutiny in the long conflict, a harbinger of what was to come. It was hushed up.  Here at home, Harold Wilson was at ­loggerheads with the unions over Employment Secretary Barbara Castle’s notorious In Place of Stre proposals to curb their powers. Labour was determined to stamp out unofficial ­stoppages, which accounted for % of strikes, widespread at that time. But fiery Mrs Castle – married to Mirror journalist Ted Castle – faced hardline ­opposition not just from union leaders but from rebel Labour MPs led by ambitious Home Secretary Jim Callaghan, lining up his bid to become Prime Minister. The Government caved in to a face-saving deal, Programme for Action, a “solemn and binding” agreement to curtail walkouts and inter-union disputes. It was approved by delegates assembling for the annual Trades Union Congress in ­Portsmouth that month.I was there for that, too Isle of Wight festival . It was an anti-climax. The TUC’s reform programme – derided as Solomon Binding – failed to halt industrial unrest, and the fiasco of the brothers and sisters embroiled in a bitter civil war ­contributed greatly to Edward Heath’s Tory victory in the general election nine months later. Again, a portent that was missed. The lesson of ministerial weakness was not lost on Britain’s coal miners, who were becoming more militant by the day. The National Union of ­Mineworkers had just lodged a claim for shorter hours for low-paid surface workers. They were often older men unable to work or those who had been injured. There were even women – “pit brow lasses” – working on the screens, sorting coal from slag, often in the coldest of conditions. This was the dispute that invented Arthur Scargill, and set the pattern for the future. Militants in the coalfields spent this month working on the first rolling all-out strike in the state-owned industry since . It was unofficial, but the NUM moderate leaders were elbowed aside and by the autumn, , men were out in Yorkshire, the Midlands, South Wales and Scotland. The strike ended when Lord Robens, chairman of the National Coal Board and a crafty former Labour politician, conceded in full the union’s annual pay claim for all miners: s d a week.

Beto O’Rourke reckons the racist El Paso Walmart massacre happened because Donald Trump has “dehumanised” those who are dferent to the majority of Americans. O’Rourke, who is fighting for the right to go up against Trump in next year’s election, said: “What America needs is hope, not hate. “Donald Trump has dehumanised or sought to dehumanise those who do not look like or pray like the majority here in this country. “What happened in El Paso is not an isolated incident. “After the President warned of ­caravans, you had somebody go into the Tree of Le synagogue in Pittsburgh warning of caravans.    “You had the mosque in Victoria, Texas, burned to the ground on the day President Trump signed his executive order to ban Muslim travel to the United States. So there are very real consequences to his words, to the tweets, to the racism that he fans. “He’s not the source of racism in this country. This country has been racist as long as it’s been a country, but he is certainly fanning the flames, he is certainly making violence like this more possible and more real.” Mr O’Rourke thanked the Mirror for its support in the fight against racism. “Together, we can and must defeat hate.” Earlier last week Mr O’Rourke was askedTrump was a “white supremacist”, to which he replied “yes”. The Irish-American was virtually unknown until he challenged Republican heavyweight Ted Cruz for the Texas Senate seat last year. Although he did not win, Mr O’Rourke almost unseated Cruz – which is unthinkable in the deeply conservative state.    So great is the congressman’s threat, Trump this week turned his attacks on him in the wake of last Saturday’s Walmart massacre. Mr O’Rourke has emerged as possible White House contender as a Mirror investigation discovered a surge in those prepared to commit murder and mayhem. It is a concern shared by millions including Melany de la Rosa. The -year-old makes the short walk along the Stanton Street Bridge border crossing, where for at least the next eight hours she feels safe. Getting up at am, she leaves her home in one of the world’s most violent cities, Ciudad Juarez, for one of America’s safest, El Paso. Despite Trump’s rhetoric about the perils from Mexico along the border, El Paso was one of America’s least murderous and secure places to live. But the facts did not deter Trump from using the Texas city for his political means. In February, during his State of the Union address, he said “the border city of El Paso used to have extremely high rates of violent crime... one of our nation’s most dangerous cities” until, he said, a border fence was built.  The lie put America’s “Safe City” in the crosshairs of hate. Last week, Patrick Crusius, , drove  miles to target the Hispanic community there. He turned into a Walmart packed with , Saturday shoppers before taking out an AK--style assault rle and selecting who should live or die. In total, he killed  people. Witnesses said he spared white shoppers as he hunted for Latinos. “I used to think I was safe in El Paso,” accountant Melany said. “The drug cartels rule Juarez, murders there are part of everyday le. When I was at work, I knew I was safe, but now it feels like we are the hunted in this city.” She believes it is because of one man – the President. The Walmart shooter is said to have published a manesto that states the attack targeted Hispanics and characterises immigrants as “invaders”. The document was reportedly posted to online forum chan, which is widely used by white supremacist “accelerationists”, who believe such mass shootings will collapse society and allow them to rebuild the all-white world they dream of.Manestos written by the suspects in shootings carried out in Christchurch, New Zealand, and Poway,Calornia, were also posted there."},{"url":null,"title":"woman claims prince andrew fondled","story":"NewsWoman claims Prince Andrew fondled her at home of paedo pal Jeffrey EpsteinJohanna Sjoberg gave a sworn deposition the Duke of York fondled her breast after she sat on his knee.ShareByChristopher Bucktin:,  AUG NewsJohanna Sjoberg claims Prince Andrew fondled her at the home of his paedo pal Jeffrey Epstein \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA second woman has claimed Prince Andrew committed a  “sexual act” with her at the home of his paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein, court documents reveal.

I was trying to get focused and figure out what was going on. I thought a bomb had gone off outside. I got everyone into the hallway and we stayed there together. I opened the front door but I was afraid of everyone to go outside because the whole street outside was white from the lightning strikes. Then I thought of the car and we went there. The sockets and light fixtures blew off. The mirrors on the wall even blew off. There is a hole in the roof and the ceiling.    Mr Alcock said that their house has been seriously damaged but they can still live inside at the moment. He added: We have no power and there is a hole in the roof but Iaposd say we could still live here. It is an old house so maybe it was the old circuits. My young granddaughter got a terrible fright from it. I cannot really remember the seconds after it struck. Putting the house right now is the next thing.

Caitlyn Gray, , pleaded guilty in court on Friday after claiming Kenan Basic, , had harassed, stalked and assaulted her despite helping fix her car in Sydney, Australia. Magistrate Glenn Walsh slammed the young woman wanting vengeance against the father-of-one, who was placed in maximum-security prison over the assault charges. Gray claimed Mr Basic, a father-of-one, sexually assaulted her after she refused to give him payment for helping her with her car on November  last year.    The -year-old was struggling to fix her radiator on the road side when Mr Basic offered to help her. Security camera footage showed the man helping the young woman with her car before giving her a hug. But Gray said he pursued her and later indecently assaulted her, grabbing her in the breast and crotch. She also claimed he stalked her around Sydney before she called her boyfriend, who then notied the police. Seven days later, Gray admitted to fabricating the entire story.

We know that as a team.“But you ask for a reaction and you ask for character – that was there in abundance in the second half.“I thought the two boys, McDaid and Todd, coming on did really well and we looked more of a threat.“Looking back at the game now it was a game of two halves — a cliche I know — but it probably ended up a fair result.“Near the end I thought we might nick it, too.“Both McDaid and Todd have been in the mix. I like both of them, and Jamie Ness is back in the mix now, too.“It’s healthy we have him back and healthy we have those two pushing for places. That adds to the squad.”So, what are the possibilities for the Dens gaffer against Ian McCall’s Honest Men Despite an error for the second goal at Dunfermline, Jack Hamilton is the undisputed No  goalie at the club and will almost certainly retain his spot ahead of second-choice Calum Ferrie.After seeing the three-man backline perform well in a commanding performance against Inverness in the Betfred Cup the match previous, it’s clear the same line-up didn’t work at Dunfermline.Every game is dferent but should McPake switch to a back four, that’ll obviously see one centre-half drop out.The knock picked up by skipper Josh Meekings and his injury history make him favourite to miss out.Andrew Davies is nowhere near match fitness so that leaves Jordon Forster and Jordan McGhee as central defenders for this one.At full-back, Jordan Marshall did OK and will likely continue, as will Cammy Kerr on the right, though he didn’t have his best night at East End Park.A shake-up in defence would bring another midfielder into play and with McDaid, Todd and Ness all banging on the door for a starting spot, McPake has decisions to make. Young Finn Robertson has been excellent so far this campaign but his youthfulness may see him replaced by the more experienced Ness for this one.Paul McGowan and Shaun Byrne are key players but,Dundee go to a -- that’s likely to see one miss out – or McGowan moved further upfield.On the wings, McDaid and Todd may have done enough to earn their starting spurs.Danny Johnson’s three goals in two matches make him almost certain to start. Less certain is Andrew Nelson’s place after he was replaced at half-time on Friday, however.Injury and illness have hampered Craig Curran lately, though he is expected to be fit for Saturday.McGowan in behind Johnson could be McPake’s pick for this big early-season clash."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bb72b7a2643d-e1538733701970.jpg ","title":"dundee united coach mcculloch wants to keep momentum going against partick","story":"Assistant boss Lee McCulloch wants to see Dundee United gain some momentum by recording their second Championship win inside a week at Partick Thistle tonight.However, to do so, they’ll first have to snuff out the threat of a man he knows very well in veteran striker Kenny Miller.The pair worked on opposite sides of Tannadice Street in the final months of last season while Miller was at Dundee but, for years before that, they were team-mates at Rangers.From that time together, Lee knows, even at , the former Scotland striker is a force to be reckoned with.“Kenny is a threat. I played with him for years and years, and I know how good a player he was then. He’s still got that burst of pace, he’s still got the movement, the mentality and he is a leader on the pitch,” he said.“It’s going to be dficult to keep him quiet but we’ve got ways and means to do that. I think his attitude has been spot-on all through his career. I think he’s maybe changed his game a wee bit since he’s got older but he’s still very effective. He’s one of a number of danger men they have.”This week has seen talk of financial crisis at Thistle, who cancelled their team bus for last weekend’s opener at Alloa.They’ve also seen lottery winner Colin Weir withdraw his seven-figure backing.Whatever the repercussions, Lee knows, with the likes of Miller in their dressing-room, come the kick-off tomorrow, the Jags players will only be concentrating trying to get three points.“I think that’s the mentality their players will need to show. I don’t know what’s going on there, we just need to concentrate on ourselves, get ourselves ready,” he said.United, meanwhile, are relaxed over their young talent being tracked by a string of clubs down south.Although they declined to comment on the matter, there has been contact from Crystal Palace who were willing to pay £, for Scott Banks.That was never close to their valuation and, right now, there is no need to sell any player.The likes of Louis Appere and Logan Chalmers have also been watched in recent weeks but they are very much seen as part of the future plans at Tannadice."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-can-recognise-anyone-old-pictures-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-can-recognise-old-pictures-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Times"},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-elvis-presley-visits-prestwick-airport-pictures-glasgow-39-s-history","story":"A selection of images from the archives of the Herald and Times."},{"url":null,"title":"emergency-services-dash-multi-vehicle-collision-m80-traffic-stops","story":"Partof the M has reopened after a five-vehicle crash ground the northbound route to a halt."},{"url":null,"title":"cake-baked-russian-granny-wins-flour-power","story":"TATIANA Camilleri baked a cake in honour of her Russian grandmother to win last nightrsquos final episode of Flour Power on the new BBC Scotland Channel."},{"url":null,"title":"university-glasgow-cleaners-back-industrial-action-unite-union-ballot","story":"CLEANERS at the University of Glasgow have voted in support of industrial action in an ongoing dispute over working conditions."},{"url":null,"title":"things-glasgow-bloc-party-tequila-tasting-platform-market","story":"Bloc Party, Summer Nights at the Kelvingrove Bandstand, Kelvingrove Park, Tomorrow"},{"url":null,"title":"derek-macdonald-planning-system-focuses-much-past-not-future","story":"Ourcompany is privileged to have been selected to manage a conversion of an exclusive property in the heart of Glasgowrsquos west end into luxury apartments.

But there’s very little contact.“Maybe the referee has a better view of it than me and obviously the player has gone down like there is more contact.“There was no danger – the ball sailed into Joe’s hands, so it all seemed very unnecessary for me.“It wasn’t a dangerous situation and that compounds the disappointment. They were huffing and puffing and their crowd were getting restless.“The game was uneventful, which suited us to a tee. It seemed to be a bit of a gt for them.”Meanwhile, McInnes insists there was no chance Scott McKenna would have left yesterday – despite a further enquiry coming in for the centre-back, who played  minutes in Rijeka.Another unnamed English Championship club made a phone call to the club regarding McKenna ahead of last night’s English deadline, while he was out in Croatia preparing for the game.It comes after a hugely eventful week for the -year-old, who handed in a transfer request ahead of the Premiership win against Hearts, but saw it turned down by the club. Queens Park Rangers and Sheffield Wednesday had bids turfed out by the club on Wednesday, with the timing riling McInnes.McKenna started last night’s - defeat as planned and while the result was far from ideal, the Dons manager was pleased with how the Scotland cap came through the game.McInnes said: “When we had the team meeting at the hotel he had his game head on. It was more of a relief for him – that’s clearly why there’s interest in him. He was on it last night – he’s been through the wringer the last wee while and had a lot to contend with, a lot of people in his ear and probably no shortage of disappointment.“McKenna is only going one way – he’s going to the top for me. He showed tonight how important he is for us and he’ll keep delivering those types of performances while he’s an Aberdeen player.“I was told there was a phone call from one other Championship team, but it didn’t amount to an offer.“It would have been too late anyway. We had a game to prepare for – when he woke up yesterday, he wasn’t going anywhere.”While there were thankfully no outgoings for McInnes to contend with, he did manage to recruit defender Zak Vyner on a season-long loan from Bristol City.Vyner journeyed out to Croatia yesterday and was an unused substitute against Rijeka, with the Dons completing the signing ahead of Wednesday night’s pm deadline.Another boost for the Dons was theof Mikey Devlin, who had been nursing a hamstring problem since the game against RoPS Rovaniemi in the first qualying round. He too was an unused sub.McInnes added: “Hegives us an extra defender in the building. We only have six senior defenders and I always like having centre-halves that can play full-back.“Andyand Zak can do it. He gives us competition and flexibility. He’s a good size and has good pace.“He’ll prove his worth to us and I’m delighted to get him in.“Devlin deserves so much credit. He pushed and pushed to get on that plane – he only had one training session under his belt. But the way things have gone over the last  hours, it was testament to him to make himself available.“Likewise to Zak, who had a bit of a journey to get there. It’s good to have more options ahead of the game on Sundayand I’m grateful to the club that we’ve been able to do that one.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/5d4cfa10d9de43.02056337-e1565364393248-777x564.jpg ","title":"ballot bins could help rid aberdeen of cigarette butt litter1","story":"A north-east MSP has made fresh calls for Aberdeen City Council to adopt a creative way of tackling litter caused by cigarette butts.Aberdeen Central MSP Kevin Stewart previously asked Aberdeen City Council to introduce ballot bins, which pose a question that can be answered by dropping a cigarette end into one of several boxes.In response to Mr Stewart’s request, council chiefs confirmed they would consider the introduction of the bins as part of a review into street sweeping and city centre cleaning programmes.Nearly a year on, Mr Stewart has renewed his calls for the innovation to be brought in following fears the idea has been binned.Ballot Bins contain two receptacles connected to each other acting as options to a question printed above.The SNP MSP had suggested a local twist on the questions such as: “What’s it called  Buttery or rowie ”He said: “Ballot Bins are a brilliant way of encouraging folk to dispose of cigarette ends properly and its use in other areas shows just how successful they can be.“The evidence is there – you only need to look at Southend Council where the ballot bin reduced cigarette litter by %.“I hope this innovative idea has not been allowed to fall by the wayside as not only will it help keep our streets clean, but hopefully we can finally settle an age-old debate – buttery or rowie ”Southend Council is Essex introduced the bins and a -week evaluation of all sites reported a % reduction in cigarette litter.But Aberdeen City Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden pointed at a lack of funding for Aberdeen City Council # the lowest-funded local authority in Scotland – adding that they have several projects they would like to introduce but can’t financially.He added: “We have a list of things we would like to introduce but the truth is that the Scottish Government that Kevin Stewart serves on, chose to cut our agreed settlement for - by £ million.“If we did have ballot bins the question could maybe be, Do you think the SNP Government care more about the Central Belt than the north-east ”A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “It is simply untrue to claim the council has received less money.“Aberdeen City Council received more than £ million Scottish Government funding in -.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal.

We challenged the soccer centre to increase the number of children participating and ask how far and often they could let the young players experience events and festivals where and I am delighted they were able to match our ambitions. For that reason and for the second year running we are providing £, of funding. We know our funding last season allowed well over  young players to receive new strips in the Red Star design and attend events across the UK and we look forward to watching their developments over the next season.#Ben Tustin of the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre was equally delighted and said that the Ardrishaig Community Trust #is an excellent partner for us without which we would not have been able to deliver many of our strategic objectives. We are wholly dependent on external funding and volunteers and we do receive generous funding from other organisations as well as the Trust.

Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"mach1 scottish tarmack rally championship report","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith  starters and  Cobble shop STRC registered the championship tables were always going to change on this mid-season two day event.Sunshine was forecast for the Machrihanish Airbase Community Companycourse and that’s what was delivered. Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing.

A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall.

We were incredibly grateful to get all, or most of the fish donated, which allowed us to give all the profits to the festival.

For example, we have baskets and containers full of stones, shells, ribbons and seeds that we’ve collected.#The nursery site is among the trees so there are lots of leaves, twigs and branches too.#We encourage the children to freely develop their ideas with everything we have here andthey have an idea of something they want to create, we try as much as we can to help them to do it.

Ardrishaig Bothy was open and help was on hand to introduce youngsters to riding a bike, or brush up on their cycle control skills. There was also a unique opportunity to join the th Duke of Argyll on a walking tour of the Crinan Canal as he uncovered the Chronicles of Crinan, butthat was too energetic then there was the option of sitting back to be entertained.Mid Argyll Pipe Band took time off from competition to play to the crowds. They joined some local bands who made sure toes were tapping from early morning until the end of the day.Of course, the main event was the ribbon cutting to formally open the Egg Shed and let the crowd who had gathered in Pier Square get a first look at the much-anticipated new building. Scottish Canals Chief Executive Catherine Topley together with Chief Executive of Argyll and Bute Council Cleland Sneddon addressed the crowd before enlisting the help of some young local helpers to help cut the ribbon and allow the first guests to flood in.As well as learning more about ‘Britain’s most beautul shortcut’, and its souvenir shop, the Egg Shed hosts a multi-purpose community space, free for the local community to use, which has a multitude of uses. It currently hosts an exhibition of Crinan Canal paintings by artist Richard Demarko, who when asked how he would describe them said they were: ‘a love letter to the Crinan Canal.’Mid Argyll Councillor Dougie Philand attended the launch and said: #It was a very well organised event and well attended.

to new Deposit Return scheme.Thousands of plastic bottles and cans could be kept out of the environment in the Scottish Borders due to a pioneering new lsquomoney backrsquo system that will encourage people to recycle more and litter less.Figures published by environmental body Zero Waste Scotland, revealed the scale of plastic bottle dumping in the Scottish Borders.And how it will be reduced by Scotlandrsquos forthcoming depositscheme.Every year, people in the Scottish Borders go through . million plastic bottles.And an estimated , of those plastic bottles are littered around the Borders each year.Under the new scheme, shoppers will pay a p deposit when buying drinks purchased in single-use plastic, glass bottles, and aluminium or steel cans.People will then get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling.That p is hoped to give people an extra incentive to recycle their empty bottles and cans, and make people think twice about dropping them.With a p incentive not to throw away your empties, Zero Waste Scotland anticipates a  per cent reduction in litter for the materials mentioned.This would mean nearly , fewer plastic bottles dropped in Scottish Borders each year.With plastic bottles only one of the materials included in the scheme, the overall impact on litter is expected to be even higher.Jill Farrell, Chief Operating Officer, Zero Waste Scotland said: ldquoOur new figures reveal how Scotlandrsquos Deposit Return Scheme could visibly slash the number of littered plastic bottles in the Borders.ldquoWe all hate seeing empty bottles and cans littering our streets, green spaces and beaches.ldquoAnd the great thing about Scotlandrsquos Deposit Return Scheme is it will give people a p incentive to do the right thing with their empty bottles, take them back for recycling, rather than risk them ending up on our streets or in our rivers.ldquoLitter isnrsquot just an eyesore ndash it also pollutes our environment and seas.ldquoAnd for every bottle littered, more plastic must be created, generating more planet-damaging emissions.ldquoWhen you take back your empty bottles to be recycled, yoursquoll not just be getting your p back, yoursquoll be doing your bit in the fight against the climate emergency.All types of drinks in containers between  ml and  litres in size are included in the Deposit Return scheme.Across Scotland, wherever people can buy a drink in a container made from one of these materials, they will also be able toit to reclaim the deposit.Online retailers will also be included in the scheme, ensuring itrsquos accessible to people that are dependent on online delivery.The Scottish Government is expected to introduce legislation to enable the scheme later this year.For more information about

It is bounded to the west by Montgomerie Terrace.ldquoThe proposed new development will be accessed via a new access created off Montgomerie Terrace, with the two new houses towards the front of the site, which replace the existing ldquodoran pre-fab and former canoe shed, accessed off the B.ldquoThese proposed homes reflect high standards of design to ensure successful integration with the character of the local area, without damaging the design characteristics of the conservation area.ldquoThe materials, scale and height of the surrounding area have all been assessed to ensure the proposed development is in keeping with the existing housing.The plans attracted five objections relating to the height of the buildings in relation to nearby properties, and raised issues surrounding privacy and sunlight.However, at a meeting of Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday August , planning officers urged councillors to approve the plans.In a written submission to the committee, planning officer Julie Hayward writes: ldquoThe main issue with the development is the potential impact of the dwellinghouses proposed on plots five and seven on the light, privacy and outlook of Orchard House to the east due to the position of the proposed houses and dfering ground levels.ldquoThe agent has submitted a drawing to show the relationship between the three houses and section drawings showing ground levels.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the proposed house on plot seven, the proposed house would have two bedroom windows in the east elevation at ground floor level and would be on slightly lower ground.

We knew it would last forever, but forever had its day.The Twin Peaks-inspired Love Dilation is as dark as it is atmospheric.But it is perhaps the utterly engrossing simplicity of Imprints that makes it so special. While McAndrew has the harmonic range, Smalls almost monotoned meanderings, accompanied by the backing vocals of Grant Pringle and Cameron Jack, creates the rawest of emotions.Concluding the new EP is the orchestral art-song, A Theory of Everything. Built around a single, beautully menacing chord, which apparently symbolises the background radiation in our universe, the finale discusses the search for discovering a unying theory of everything.To quote Small from Imprints, As you travel through space, you are displaced, imagining time. You exist like a plant, you bloom and you grow, then wither and die. But the one card you play, genetically, is always an ace. For the imprints you leave, have changed the fabric of time and space.If there is any justice in the supersonic space-age future, Electron Masss four EPs will hopefully have changed the fabric of

at Barrel Law, near Hawick.In September, plans for an poundm wind farm were rejected by Scottish Borders councillors.The proposal would have seen seven turbines, of up to m in height, erected on land to the north-west of Roberton, near Hawick.The company behind the plans, Germany-based ABO Wind, then submitted an appeal to the Scottish Governmentrsquos planning and environmental appeals ision .As part of that appeal process, the DPEArsquos appointed reporter Elspeth Cook held a hearing at Forman Hall, Roberton.However, the hearing was simply to clary and define legal terms and certain technical standards in order to help inform Ms Cookrsquos decision.For example, one point of contention between Scottish Borders Council and ABO Wind is whether or not the combined appearance of Barrel Law and the existing wind turbines at Langhope Rig will create a lsquolandscape with wind turbinesrsquo or a lsquowind turbine landscapersquo, as per the legally-defined definitions.The councilrsquos position is that a distance of between -km is required in order to maintain the current landscape type in the valley, but ABO Wind suggest the turbines should be less than km apart, as they state that spreading out the two turbine sites would actually make the landscape look more saturated as the wind turbines would effectively cover a larger area.Furthermore, they state that a greater distance between the two developments would push the Barrel Law turbines outside of the topography which makes wind farms viable in this area.Appearing as part of ABO Windrsquos  of representatives, land and development consultant James Welsh told the reporter: ldquoIn our opinion we preserve the distinct identity of the two groups.ldquoThere are examples of wind farms being approved with similar distances between them but still being accepted as being clearly separate wind farms.ldquoTo insist on a greater separation would increase the effect of a cumulative effect between them.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning consultant, Dr Guy Wimble, said: ldquoI donrsquot dispute that they are identiable as separate elements, my issue is the effect of the wind farms on the landscape, and recognising that they are two dferent wind farms not one development.ldquoThe proximity of them makes this appear more of a wind farm landscape rather a landscape with wind farms.ldquoWhile I accept that separating the developments would make the wind farms seem more spaced out, by putting them closer yoursquod increase density.John Campbel QC, appearing on behalf of a group of objectors called Barrel Law Action Group, said: ldquoIf you pull the wind farms apart then clearly you increase the area of cumulative effect.ldquoIf you pull them together, yoursquore going to increase the cumulative effect just by sheer numbers, and you lose the ability to discern the two as distinct entities.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, appearing in his capacity as Scottish Borders Councilrsquos executive member for planning and environment, told the hearing: ldquoIt seems to me that the guidance allows for developments in this area but doesnrsquot necessarily promote it.ldquoNo one is disputing that the two wind farms would be separate, wersquore working to find out what degree of separation would be appropriate.Mr Welsh responded: ldquoIf you increase to a km distance it will push all m turbines outwith the area that has been identied as having the appropriate topography for this type of development.Ms Cook also sought clarication on certain technical points, mostly surrounding tables and figures contained within ious reports submitted by the appellant and the local authority."},{"url":null,"title":"letter islay in darkness","story":"We are

There was a lot of spirit and a feeling that a number of towns in Scotland which have been forgotten, like Campbeltown, will not be left behind after independence.#He put the turnout at more than , and added: #The fact that the march extended theof Longrow gives a fair indication of the numbers who were there.He also told the Courier this week that he remained the #legal indentity# of the All Under One Banner group, despite a bitter public row among the hierarchy which looks like splitting the group in two.It was the biggest rally held in the town in recent years with marchers coming from as far afield as Aberdeen and Alloa and as well as Oban, Glasgow and Islay, with many travelling on the weekend ferry from Ardrossan.#It really exceeded expectations and made a big splash in the town, Ron Wilson of Yes Kintyre told The National.#There was a real buzz as people came early and most of the hotels were booked up. The pubs and cafes were busy so it was good for local businesses. Campbeltown is a Yes town and it was brilliant to have all these people come here. Local people were coming off the pavements and joining the procession so it created a good, positive vibe.Pro-Unionists opponents held their own counter demonstation. However, the march went off without any incident and there were no arrests, with only one warning which was drug related.A spit of rain earlier in the day failed to develop into poor weather as the marchers would round the town to hear speakers and listen to musicians at the rally at Kinloch Green.Mr Wilson said he was particuarly pleased at the turnout as there had been some confusion over whether the march would go ahead due to internal sions within the hierachcy of All Under One Banner, which has organised independence marches across the country.Following Mr Singh#s sacking, founder Neil Mackay resigned from his position on its national executive pending an internal investigation.Pro-UK Unionist group A Force For Good met the march on the shore front and say they filmed and counted the marchers, as they have at previous events, and afterwards claimed the turnout was just .Director, Alistair McConnachie, said: #All Under One Banner is basically the marching wing of the SNP. AUOB, and SNP MPs and MSPs, lie about the numbers which attend their marches, sometimes up to  or  times.#Unfortunately, they are not challenged by the Scottish media. The good news is that A Force For Good has a presence at every AUOB march. We bear witness to the huge value of the United Kingdom.  Our #Thin Red Line# stands for everyone who likes being British, who likes the UK, and who wants us to stay together.#A group from Barrowfield at the Campbeltown cross ahead of the march.

are fortunate in Scotland to have a way out of such dficulties in the form of a Debt Arrangement Scheme , which is one of Scotland’s best-kept secrets.  It’s available from charitable organisations such as StepChange and from commercial debt advisers such as TC Debt Solutions, too.  It is a Scottish Government scheme that is legally binding and prevents creditors from taking further action against people who owe money.Set up back in  by the Scottish Government, the scheme allows people to freeze interest and charges on their debts and pay their debts off interest-free over a longer period of time.  This brings payments down to levels that people can afford and gives people the chance to get their lives back on track.  Interest and charges are simply written off.Apart from reducing debt, one of the best things about the DAS scheme is that it protects people from their creditors but is not a form of insolvency: people get to pay back their debt in an affordable way.  Lenders like the scheme because they know they will eventually get their money back – and borrowers like it because they don’t have to pay interest charges and they get longer to pay their debts off.  It’s a case of everyone wins.There’s plenty of information about the Debt Arrangement Scheme online at  www.aib.gov.uk debt-arrangement-scheme.  Thousands of people have used the scheme, but so many

summer tournament, winning the competition in , the one-off match was played in a good spirit, but it was the Pupils who found their ruthless streak to snatch a win in the closing minutes.Rhu, fielding a team with plenty of height and energy, featuring several former youth players from Dumbarton FC # and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots blocked at their own end, thanks to some vital interventions from Robertson, the Pupils stole a winner when midfield substitute Finn Scott was teed up by Scott Souden to slot the ball home low beyond the Rhu keeper, ensuring the visitors completed pre-season unbeaten.Pupils manager Campbell Robertson said: ‘The conditions were tough, but the boys played really well, and our shape was good too. We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at Kintyre Park, in the SAFL’s aptly named Centenary Cup, with a pm kick-off.And with two more Saturday group matches to follow in August, firstly away to Dunoon and then at home to Tarbert, the Pupils will look to continue their dazzling pre-season form once the competitive action begins.Photograph:"},{"url":null,"title":"simply the best for james","story":"James was + after nine holes and then proceeded to put together an excellent back nine to finish on +.Meanwhile Donald had gone to + n the front nine only to fall back on the inward nine and finished on +.Result: , James Williamson +  ,  Donald Brown +  ,  Bill Brannigan +  ,  Sandy Watson +  , Ken MacMillan +  , Robert Cook  +."},{"url":null,"title":"letter trying to keep everyone happy","story":"We, as the private landowners, have endeavoured throughout the years to make this historical area  as fully accessible to the general public as possible.Our use of introducing a few sheep to graze down the grass over certain months of the year is our preferred method but often, when summer visitors appear, we find the animals get frequently disturbed and distressed with human contact , and very often remove them in busy months to avoid any upset.The larger access gate is frequently left wide open, leading to constant rounding up of the livestock and  posing a danger to the passing road users, with even the odd complaint about our animals ‘deposits’  around the Footprints area coming into the equation too.Changing climate conditions have ensured that bracken and other plant species have increased in volume as every year passes and with worry about the decreasing insect population and visiting dogs perhaps being harmed by ingesting sprayed grass, we have never used any chemical solutions to help keep the undergrowth at bay.Strimming has been used on occasions  but this, too, has produced complaints from the public about the unnecessary removal of wild flowers and plants that provide food for the visiting bird and butterfly population.Sign posts are often needlessly torn down and often used to fuel beach fires and barbecues, with even the old, fragile, stone dyke surrounding the area being constantly clambered over,  rather than using the access gate, causing stones to be dislodged and even the wall being  deliberately dismantled, in order to use the stones to construct fire pits for outdoor cooking.In short, we’ve found there are never any easy answers when it comes to trying to keep everyone happy.Yours,Catherine Barbour,"},{"url":null,"title":"top artist jolomo finds inspiration on his doorstep","story":"The latest exhibition by John Lowrie Morrison, which opens on Saturdayat the Archway Gallery in Lochgilphead, concentrates on paintings of Crinan and Knapdale, landscapes found within a few miles of his Tayvallich home.Although John’s work is now sought out by collectors all over the world, he continues to exhibit every August at his #local# gallery # this will be his th solo exhibition at the Archway.

It clear the ongoing political uncertainty is suppressing confidence and demand across the UK economy.ldquoIn particular, investment remains weak, with many businesses putting on hold long-term plans.ldquoOne more quarter of negative growth and the UK would formally enter a technical recession.ldquoAt this stage it is far too earlyto say whether or not this will happen.ldquoBut one thing we can be sure of is the economic data for the UK will continue to be volatile over the coming months as we moveever close to the next deadline of October ."},{"url":null,"title":"thousands-descend-glasgow-world-pipe-band-championships","story":"The competition will welcome  bands from  countries on August  and  as Glasgow Green once again plays host to the event.Nations represented at the championships include New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Austria, Switzerland, Eire, the US, Belgium, England, Spain, Malaysia, Northern Ireland and Scotland.Many tickets have already sold out for the weekend but organisers say there is still a chance to snap up seats for the finale of the Grade  competition where the world champions will be crowned.Ian Embelton, Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association chief executive, said: \"Year after year, pipe bands across the world head to Glasgow and the World Pipe Band Championships knowing they face the ultimate test of their skill.\"The competitions are of the highest quality, with bands constantly finding the smallest improvements in the pursuit of a perfect performance.\"It all adds up to a thrilling competition that builds to an incredible conclusion on Saturday evening when the world champions are crowned.\"It is the culmination of the Piping Live!

Internal features such as stone benches have also been found along either side.The hall is oriented towards the sea and finds include steatite , pottery, a bone spindle whorl and a fragment of a Norse bone comb.The find provides tantalising evidence of the earliest phases of inhabitation on this farm and settlement mound which may well have been inhabitated for over , years.It provides another piece to the ,-year jigsaw along this archaelogy rich stretch of coast as Westness in Rousay — described as the #Egypt of the North#.A team of archaeologists from the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute, Rousay residents and students have been digging at the site for a number of years, investigating the later stages of the farm complex and its waste heaps with a particular focus on past diet, farming and fishing practices.Although only partly uncovered at this stage, the Skaill hall has parallels with other Norse halls excavated in Orkney, such as Snusgar, and where in Scotland.The excavation is part of the Landscapes of Change — Archaeologies of the Rousay Clearances and Westness Estate project which is exploring the Skaill farmstead.The present farm at Skaill dates to the th and th centuries and was part of the Rousay clearances during the mid-th century.The name Skaill suggests the site was home to a Norse hall or drinking hall, and was a high status site.Westness is mentioned in Orkneyinga saga as the home of Sigurd, a powerful chieftain, so it was always likely that a Norse settlement was located somewhere at Skaill.Earlier structures have been found below the present farm during previous seasons, and this season explored more of the Norse phases of the site.Three dimensional models of the farmstead can be found here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Striking the balance between conservation, farming and hunting can be dficult. Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, enabling them to control goose numbers sustainably, and sell goose meat for profit.”Until now, meat generated by the Orkney resident greylag goose project could only be sold locally by retailers based on Orkney.SNH is working to secure longer-term arrangements for the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland.

Understandably, she declared there was “growing urgency” for Scotland to become independent because it faced being “dragged down a political path we don’t want to go”.Cue much licking of SNP lips at thoughts of a No Deal disaster, sweeping gains at a General Election as Scottish Labour’s tailspin turns into a screaming e, victory in a second independence vote next year and,the last prospectus was anything to go by, the  Scottish parliament elections to be for the first independent Scottish legislature. But some pro-independence commentators have begun to question the assumption that Boris Johnson is a gt and a No Deal departure will be the best precursor to separation. It is unquestionably true that the SNP does not want a No Deal exit, but then neither does the UK government, but is a soft Brexit like that agreed by ex-Prime Minister Theresa May really a path Ms Sturgeon doesn’t want to do down For the SNP, it could be the best of both worlds: it would still be Brexit, so Scotland will have been “dragged out the EU against its will” but with customs and regulations aligned the UK would have to play by EU rules over which it had no control. Under those circumstances the SNP would argue an independent Scotland back in the EU would give Scotland a say and with no adverse effect on rUK trade.No Deal is the reverse, where an independent Scotland going back into the EU would mean trade barriers, virtual or otherwise, where none currently exist because automatic harmonisation will have ended and the Irish question becomes the Scottish question. With four times as much Scottish trade going to the rest of the UK than to Europe, whatever the economic impact of the UK leaving the EU it would be four times as greatScotland left the UK.These febrile times are leading to a loss of grip and perspective, like Labour’s John McDonnell who promised yesterday that Labour would let the Scottish parliament decide whether there should be a second independence referendum, which it already has, even referring to Westminster as the “English parliament”. In one-garrulous Fringe chat show, Scottish Labour’s election pledge is now for Indyref , much to the dismay of Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray.Even in the parliamentary recess, the momentum towards an autumn election is accelerating because with no sign of European willingness to renegotiate the alternatives are a new parliament and a change of government or a No Deal departure on October .With his working majority down to one, the chances of a No Confidence vote when Westminster reconvenes in September are high, but Mr Johnson is not compelled to call an election and instead has  days to demonstrate he can form a new government which commands a majority. Onlythat fails must an election be called, so it is not unfeasible for an election to be after October  by which time the UK will have left the EU without a deal.The Conservative position of honouring the results of the  and  referenda and opposing re-runs of both has the benefit of consistency and for the sake of the Union Scottish Conservatives have no alternative but to get right behind the UK government and be ready for November .

The goodwill for such agreements was there, she added.It is easy to see the appeal of such agreements for those voters who believe that Brexit – especially the no-deal iety now envisaged by the Prime Minister – represents a catastrophic act of self-harm. If Swinson and the leaders of other avowedly anti-Brexit parties could reach agreements in key constituencies across the UK to stand only the candidate with the greatest chance of winning then, surely, the chances of the Johnson project being stopped in its tracks would be greatly enhanced.There are just one or two small hurdles in the way…The first of these is the fact that, although speculation runs feverishly, Johnson has not yet called a general election.It’s certainly true that many Conservative Party MPs would like the new PM to capitalise on a boost in the polls to try to increase their numbers at Westminster, but others believe this might be a risky strategy. If Nigel Farage’s Brexit Partysplits the right-wing Eurosceptic vote, then a snap election could bring the Johnson premiership to a sudden end.But let us imagine that Johnson goes down the general election route before the current Brexit deadline of  October and that Swinson sets about trying to build an anti-Brexit coalition. She might have been able to persuade Plaid and the Greens to step aside in a single by-election, but would these parties really be so keen to lay down their electoral chances across the country  Would they risk, by seeing their overall votes in a general election diminish severely, becoming less politically relevant And what about the SNP, every bit as opposed to Brexit as the Lib Dems  There are fewer seats in Scotland where anti-Brexit parties risk splitting the vote than there are in England, but one of them – East Dunbartonshire – is Swinson’s own.Swinson served as MP for that constituency between - and was then defeated by the SNP’s John Nicolson. She took the seat back in , largely, I suspect because of Nicolson’s unpopularity. But with a more impressive candidate, the SNP would surely have a fighting chance of snatching it back. The removal of the leader of the Liberal Democrats from the House of Commons would represent quite a scalp for the nationalists. Can you imagine Nicola Sturgeon passing up the opportunity to see off Swinson  I can’t. And nor would I blame the SNP leader for committing signicant resources to bringing down Swinson. Politics is a contact sport and Swinson is a major target. The suggestion from her that the SNP should give her a clear run at the seat would, rightly, be met with derision.Jo Swinson is not the only party leader now talking about pacts. Brexit Party leader Farage has raised the prospect of deals with the Conservatives, particularly in the north of England, to ensure the election of Eurosceptic MPs.Given the result of the  referendum, any such agreements would surely guarantee the evisceration of any anti-Brexit candidates in those areas.Yes, electoral pacts might be made to work for pro-EU parties but they could just as easily be the secret of Brexiteer success.Those now clamouring for agreements to be struck between the Lib Dems and other parties which take the same position on EU membership should, I think, be careful that they are not wishing for the creation of two-horse races in key constituencies across the country. That scenario would risk strengthening rather than weakening the Brexiteers’ squad at Westminster.Johnson is supported by a team in government that is fully committed to Brexit by  October at any cost. The PM will gladly sacrice the best interests of the UK economy to protect himself.This being so, and with Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour still embarrassingly weak on the matter of Brexit, the idea that the Johnson project might be stopped is an appealing one to those of us who would dearly like to see Brexit cancelled at this late stage.But I fear that any plan to run a single anti-Brexit candidate in a constituency would be met with a plan to run a single pro-Brexit candidate. Jiggery-pokery would be fought with jiggery-pokery.It is abundantly clear that Brexiteers won the  referendum with a campaign strewn with lies. Their promises of an effortless, painless departure from the EU have long since been exposed.But rather than turning against campaign leaders, pro-Brexit voters appear to be hardening their positions and cheering on a damaging no-deal departure.It may now be obvious that Brexit is going to be dficult to deliver. But stopping it will be harder still.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lothian bus strike off after drivers agree deal with bosses","story":"Unite the union said the , membership agreed to the deal which ends any potential strike action during the Fringe.Last week, union leaders and Lothian Buses management brokered a deal, which led to continuous strike action being suspendedThe strike action was initially tabled amid allegations of a ldquotoxic management culture within Lothian Busesrsquo management.Unite regional industrial officer Lyn Turner said: \"Our members have the assurances that they required, we look forward on working with the company on the proposals that were agreed today.\"We would like to thank the public for their support they have given us over the last few months.\": Edinburgh Lothian Buses strike: These are the terms of the new deal in fullHe added: \"Unite is pleased that our membership have agreed to the latest set of proposals which address the central issues at the heart of this long running dispute.\"It was only right that further assurances were given on fully addressing the bullying and hostile culture which has existed at Lothian Buses.\"Unite would like to thank the people of Edinburgh for their patience and the great support which they have given to the workers, and also to those representatives at the City of Edinburgh Council who have worked positively with us to resolve this dispute.\"There is hard work ahead to ensure that the workplace culture improves, and Unite will play our full part in delivering a service which the workers and the public can be fully proud of.\"More than three quarters of a  per cent turnout of Unite members voted in favour of the proposals which focus on improving workplace culture.The agreement includes the appointment of an independent council officer who will deal with issues of \"behaviours and trust\", as reported by the Evening News on Tuesday.It also covers other issues surrounding working conditions, sht s and changes to pay.Transport and environment convener at City of Edinburgh council, Lesley Macinnes, said: ldquoIrsquom very pleased that both parties have now reached an agreement which avoids the prospect of a deeply damaging period of disruption to our public transport network at the busiest time of the year.: Edinburgh Lothian Buses strike: Council HR official to oversee bullying investigationsThe full terms of the deal are below- There will be a high level of review of all cases received from the union in respect of bullying and harassment.

It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity, to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the Trust is now working to secure funding for a project officer to take the Skye Cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port. A breakwater will allow us to provide overnight berths and efficient, comfortable transfer for cruise ship passengers, while a visitor centre will provide a warm highland welcome to visitors from across the globe. This project will be transformational for Portree and surrounding areas.#The community trusts of Skye and Lochalsh all have several features in common. They have vision, ambition, energy and drive and they are full of volunteers who are committed to bringing long-term projects to fruition for the benefit of their community # and their visitors # for decades to come."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Skye-Bridge-2018-winners.jpg","title":"skye bridge 10k race to kick start kyleakin gala","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe first bridge k was held  years ago, and since  hundreds have taken on the challenge in an event which has helped raise thousands of pounds for good causes based in Kyleakin and surrounding areas.back again.Online entry — which is discounted — will be open until Friday th August, or runners can register on the morning of the race for £.

It’s really invaluable having Deirdre and Micheál onboard and it was incredible to see so much of an eclectic mix of people at the launch. Art and creativity is very much part of the foundation of Féile.”Aisling Award winner Deirdre Mackel has spent six years at the helm of the visual arts exhibition having previously become involved as an exhibitor. “I have seen the exhibition grow over the years, it’s brilliant to be a part of, to see the amount of people coming in and just taking their time to see the art works,” she said. “It just really warms my heart to see all the art up in St Mary’s.”Deirdre spoke of the amount of preparation that goes into the artistic showcase each year. “There is a lot of background work, the call that goes out for artists to display in the first instance. When you see people coming in and installing their art works it’s just magical. You really get a sense of what it means on launch night which we had last Wednesday, seeing what it means to people, to the artist it lts my spirits. Debuting artists would say ‘I’m so nervous’ and they come back year after year, the exhibition really encourages new artist development and another thing that comes out of it is a real sense of volunteering.”Deirdre continued: “Local artist Micheál Gallagher has also come on board and the team have been very much hands on deck. We have some really stand-out pieces from the West Belfast Arts Society, Richard Kelly and a focal point is always the Relatives for Justice Remembrance Quilt. We have a series of Civil Rights posters which were exhibited in the Tate Modern and now they have been brought to Féile.“We are seeing a lot of the artists coming here with their families and staying for the duration of the festival. The visual arts exhibit gains more and more momentum year on year.” The Féile Visual Arts Exhibition will be on display until Thursday, August .

To play in West Belfast, the atmosphere was really incredible, it was emotional.”Joby said that he is “looking forward” to sharing a stage with all who are on the ‘Greatest Hits’ bill come August .“They are good friends of mine and have all influenced me one way or another over the years, West Belfast is overflowing with talent.”A roadie “lting gear at the back of the Ulster Hall for U and the Horselips”, Joby was heavily influenced by his brother Martin and his mother Mary. “The house always had music in it,” he says.“The night at the Cultúrlann will be informal, I’ll be telling a few stories of some of the songs that I’ve written, telling of my musical adventures from when I was kid. The first song I ever wrote was Belfast when I was . Ten years later we were in the British charts, that song has really resonated with people,” he said.He continued: “I was doing a gig with Iain Archer in the Oh Yeah Centre recently and he told me that Belfast was the song that made him believe that he could have a career in music, it really took me back to hear that from him as he is credited with writing Run with Snow Patrol. He said that Energy Orchard inspired him to get into music. You never know what a song can do for a person.”Joby spoke of how much he is looking forward to getting “those characters” his musical compadres in the one room come the end of the month at the Devenish event.“Rab McCullough’s guitar playing, the energy of Baraka really rubbed off on us. On the sleeve of the first Energy Orchard album we thanked Rab and Malachy McCambridge, the keyboard player, for giving us the blues. Those days up in the Club-house on the Glen Road, they were days we’ll never forget, it was electrying. The angst of the Troubles, that pent up anger everything was exorcised on a weekly basis through Baraka’s performances.“This month is going to be a memorable one, I’m looking forward to seeing Brianon the night at the Devenish who’d be a good friend of mine.

Some of the features retained in the house include a stone floor that is over  years old and a Royal Mail postbox that dates back to Queen Victorias reign. The unusual detail of the thatched house with its steep roof, eaves gutter and tall chimney is unique in Northern Ireland, according to the Department for Communities.This means the house appears to the passer-by as two dwellings, each with a front door, but it is in fact a single dwelling which for most of the past century has been home to the Maccombe family.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetMurray Maccombeis the third generation of his family to live in the magnicent dwelling, which sits on a three-acre site.Speaking to the Belfast , Mr Maccombe said he has fond memories of the house going back to his early years.He said: \"My grandfather Robert Henry Maccombe bought this house around  and it has been in our family since, but the original owner was a man called Hugh McCullagh.\"At the time my grandfather bought it, it was a farmhouse but also a grocers shop hardware store and it stayed like that until  when he opened a shop separate from the house.\"I have very clear memories of visiting my grandparents and obviously living there when my father Alan took it over.\"My father passed away in  but my mother stayed on, on her own.\"I moved in with my own family in  and I will be sad to leave the house, but really it has outgrown my we and I. \"Our two daughters are away at university and the reality it the house is too large for us to upkeep, especially the gardens, but it will be a great buy for someone.\"The house is being sold for Mr Maccombe by Donnybrook Estate Agents in Derry for offers over £,.Stephen McCarron said he expects that the house will attract a lot of interest.He said: \"We are delighted to have this magnicent property on our books for sale and there has been interest shown already from people in the UK and further afield. \"It is a property steeped in history but also comes with so much potential for development and I am optimistic it will have a new owner before long.\"Further details and an appointment to view can be arranged through Donnybrook Estate Agents on   "},{"url":null,"title":"pm ready to talk to eu leaders about border backstop alternatives gove","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

stands ready to engage with any EU leader about alternatives to the Irish border backstop, Michael Gove has said..pushOn a visit to Northern Ireland, Mr Gove was asked why Boris Johnson had not taken up Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s invite to Dublin to discuss the Brexit impasse.On Friday, Mr Gove, the Cabinet minister responsible for no-deal planning, heard about the potential Brexit challenges facing businesses as he toured Warrenpoint Port in Co Down, which sits beside the Irish border.Brussels and London remain at loggerheads over the prospect of fresh Brexit negotiations.The UK Government has said any new negotiations must focus on developing an alternative to the Withdrawal Agreement.EU leaders insist the deal cannot be reopened but will engage on potential amendments to the Political Declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the bloc.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Michael Gove talks to Warrenpoint Harbour Authority CEO Clare Guinness Earlier this week, Mr Varadkar said the invite remained open for Mr Johnson to join him in Dublin for talks on Brexit and other issues with “no preconditions”.On Friday, Mr Gove insisted his government’s links with counterparts in Ireland remain “very good”, despite the Prime Minister’s decision not to as yet take up the invitation.“I think the Prime Minister has talked to the Taoiseach and there are links at every level between the UK Government and the government in the Irish Republic,” he said.“We have very good bilateral relations and of course we are also talking to other EU partners as well.“In the event of a no-deal then naturally there will be issues to be addressed, not just security but trade issues as well.“We will make sure that we safeguard the security of the people on the island of Ireland and we will also make sure that trade continues to flow as freely as possible.”He later added: “The Prime Minister is keen to explore with European Union leaders how we can ensure we can have a withdrawal agreement that will pass Parliament.“He’s talked to leaders across the EU and he stands ready during the course of the next couple of months to speak to any EU leader and pursue with as much energy and openness as possible what alternative arrangements might be which would ensure we can secure an orderly and timely withdrawal from the EU.”The contentious border backstop is an insurance policy written into the withdrawal treaty that will ensure, come what may in future trade talks, that the Irish border will remain free-flowing post-Brexit.It would see the UK, as a whole, enter into a customs union with the EU for an indefinite period and also see Northern Ireland adhere to EU single market rules on goods.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Cabinet minister said the UK would leave the EU on October  Askedthe Government could envisage a compromise, where a iation of the backstop could be retainedchanges were made – such as the introduction of a time limit – Mr Gove said he would not “pre-empt” negotiations with the EU.“We stand ready to work with the Irish Government, or EU partners and theCommission in order to attempt to resolve these problems,” he said.Mr Gove said in the event of a no-deal, the Government would want to see a “continuity approach” to the way goods were transported across the Irish border, reiterating the Government’s “cast iron commitment” not to have a hard border or infrastructure at the border.Asked how much the Government would spend preparing for a no-deal, Mr Gove replied: “Whatever it takes.”During his visit to the port, Mr Gove was also asked to respond to the Taoiseach’s contention that a no-deal Brexit will not enable the UK to leapfrog unresolved issues to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU.Mr Varadkar said in the wake of a no-deal, talks on a future trading relationship would still not begin until matters in the current withdrawal agreement – such as citizens’ rights, the financial settlement and the Irish border – were resolved.“I think the Taoiseach is understandably making clear what he believes is in the interests not just of the Irish government, people on the island of Ireland, the European Union and in the UK as well,” said Mr Gove.“We have good bilateral relations with the Irish Government and good multilateral relations with other EU heads of government and we are going to carry on talking.“One of the things I am here to do is make sure I develop an even deeper understanding, issue by issue, of all the things we need to do in order to safeguard trade, jobs and prosperity across the island of Ireland and within the United Kingdom.”I dont want a general election because I believe it is important that we get on with delivering Brexit.Michael GoveAsked about the prospects of a general election in the autumn, Mr Gove said he did not want a poll.“We will have Brexit on October  – the Prime Minister has been absolutely clear that is the position in law that we have to leave the European Union and that is the date that has been agreed between the EU  and the UK,” he said.“I don’t want a general election because I believe it is important that we get on with delivering Brexit and also ensure that the other opportunities that the Prime Minister has made clear that he wants the United Kingdom to enjoy can be provided.”Mr Gove was also asked about reports that tens of thousands of dairy cattle would have to be culled in Northern Ireland in a no-deal scenario, due to the disruption to the cross-border processing chain.He highlighted that the Ulster Farmers Union had dismissed the reports.Mr Gove added: “As Defra Secretary I am on the record in the House of Commons and where having acknowledged that there are particular sectors of agriculture that face particular challenges in the event of a no-deal Brexit.“One of my jobs is to ensure that we can help agriculture and the food and drink sector whatever the circumstances after October .”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38389932.ece/fa98f/AUTOCROP/w620/utv.jpg","title":"radio station u105 in apology over cyclist social","story":" Hi degC | Lo

And, a charity called Think Pacic provided the young woman with the vehicle to fulfil her ambition.“I’ve always wanted to go away to help people, because my degree involves quite a degree of caring for people. One of my friends at university did it last year, so I spoke to him about it and then we had a talk about at university and I looked at the Think Pacic website as well. Then I had a phone interview and got accepted for it.“After I was accepted into the programme, I just read up on it and became more interested in doing something,” Orlaith said.Think Pacic allows volunteers to sample le at the heart of remote Fijian villages far removed from what normally passes as backpacking trips in students gap years. Each team of volunteers stays in a dferent community and they are immersed into every aspect of the le of the country’s customs, values and traditions.“We had a welcome ceremony when we entered the village and were given a traditional Fijian drink called Kava. It’s a sedative drink derived from the pepper plant and it’s used for ceremonial occasions.“The Fijian’s believe in sharing everything so no one ever goes without. They are a very traditional people and we had to dress very modestly so as not to show any disrespect. Our shoulders had to be covered and we had to wear long dresses called Bula dresses and skirts called Sulu’s,” Orlaith continued.The charity was founded in the early s and adopts a bespoke approach to its volunteer work in the South Pacic country. Often, teams of volunteers are the first top have ever worked in the communities they visit because the trips only take placea Fijian community agrees to invite them there in the first place. Rather than focussing on just a single school or location it means that Think Pacic can reach thousands of children each year and spread the message of education, sport and health.This model means that the overall project is sustainable, especially as volunteers train local leaders to carry on the work after they have departed. It’s also a programme that has been fully embraced by the Fijian Government.Orlaith, a former student at Lumen Christi says that Think Pacic have taken specic steps to avoid what’s become known as ‘voluntourism’. The term refers to the growing phenomenon of iniduals travelling to developing countries to carry out volunteer work. Recently, there have been increasing concerns about voluntourism and in particular gap year projects that some have suggested that can cause more harm than good to host communities.Primary concerns are that some charitable organisations are running volunteering trips along business lines and can result in the institutionalisation of children.Orlaith Duffy’s month long stay in Fiji was on the country’s main island Viti Levu at Muanaira village- a remote rural setting around two hours from the national capital Suva.Orlaith told the Derry News: “Think Pacic have moved away from voluntourism because they know that a lot of organisations take students money and students are staying in hotels and then spending a small amount of time helping people.“So, it’s a bit contradictory. Think Pacic want you to live with villagers then every day from am until pm we would go to the school. We would teach from am until pm they do sports in the afternoon.”In fact, teaching in the in the village school where the pupil’s age range runs from six to -years of age is a vital component of the volunteering workOrlaith continued: “Think Pacic have dferent key learning aims. Schooling in Fiji is very basic, so I noticed that children at the same age over they compared to our own children here had very dferent levels of education.“Their education is so far behind because teachers just don’t have enough time or resources to focus on the children that are falling behind. We would have sat in the classroom and noticedthere were particular children falling behind. Then we would take them out and do one on one’s with them. We tried to strip it back to basics and do basic maths with them before moving on to the more dficult stuff that they were getting taught in class.“We also did a lot of letter phonics with their sounds and their grammar because sometimes they didn’t understand why certain words were put in front of other words and sentences. And we did a lot of work with past and present tenses because they weren’t sure about that either. We got to choose what age group we wanted to work with as well so the one on one sessions would have been with primary one’s up until primary sevens. So, I chose ‘kindi’, like nursey, which was five-year-olds. They were learning their alphabet and numbers and arts and crafts. We did a dferent letter with them each day. They would practice how to draw the letter and practice their numbers.”In the classroom the children are expected to converse in English-something which presents another educational challenge.Three main languages are used in Fiji-English, Fijian and Fijian Hindi. Fijian is spoken by most indigenous Fijians who account for almost  per cent of the country’s population. Fijian’s of Indian descent make up another  per cent of the population and mainly speak Fijian Hindi.The English language is a remnant of British colonial rule and was the sole official language until . English is widely used in government, business and education circles, but business is also widely carried out in Fijian, especially in rural areas.A small number of other Indigenous West Fijian and East Fijian regional languages are spoken on the islands, standard Fijian belonging to the East Fijian group. Chinese and Rotuman are also spoken by immigrant populations.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshOrlaith said: “In school it’s all English. The younger children find it more dficult and the teacher would speak Fijian to the nursery children-so half in English, half in Fijian. But everything  is done in English.”Viti Levu is the largest island in the Republic of Fiji and is home to  per cent of the entire population-around , people. The island is just over  miles long and  miles wide. Its rugged terrain is explained by the fact that it was created largely as a result of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.Territorially, the island is ided into roughly equal halves by a mountain range running from north to south. The island’s centre is covered by forest and is dominated by Fiji’s highest mountain-Mount Tomanivi which stands at , feet.The eastern side of the island experiences heavy rainfall, while the western side, also called the \"burning west\" is noticeably drier in the ranges rain shadow. Similarly, sugar cane production thrives in the west, while a dairy industry is being built in the east. Fijis biggest cattle ranch is at Yaqara, with  head of cattle on its , acres.Orlaith Duffy said: “Living with the villagers gave us a better idea of the culture. Living standards are very basic-a lot of mornings there would be no running water to wash or brush teeth. The water pressure was a lot better at night. The houses only had a single tap so the man of the house would spend time filling a lot of buckets with water so that would be used for cooking. The shower we had was a bucket with holes in it, so we just used that to wash ourselves.“In Fiji as well, the diet is very carb heavy and very sugar heavy. There’s a need to encourage children to brush their teeth so we took toothpaste and toothbrushes out there. The school I went to was already quite well developed in that way so that was good to see.“There was a man in our village and because he had severe diabetes he had to have his leg amputated. So, we carried out a health workshop and spoke about strokes and heart attacks and how to spot the signs, prevent them and what to doyou see someone taken one. We also did basic teaching on how to clean cuts and not to leave them exposed. We left first aid kits behind in the village as well.Like the domestic dwellings Orlaith said that the school buildings were also basic consisting of concrete and corrugated roofs.“If there isn’t enough room to accommodate all of the children they would add on a couple of Portacabins.“Some of the villages are remote, so people make their living from fishing. But where I stayed, because it was around two hours from the capital, I noticed that a lot of the Fijian’s who are my age where at university. When we lived with a family, we referred to the parents as our mum and dad.“My Fijian dad was in the military, so it was interesting to talk to him because he was very well travelled. The mum has a degree in accounting, but she has given it up because she’s looking after the children. But, a lot of the islanders don’t work at all because they were the ones that fell behind at school.“Luckily, our school was only a  minute walk from the village but I know that other school’s are about  minutes or an hour’s trek every day. I also noticed that sometimes the children just aren’t encouraged to go to school by their parents because some of them would have just stayed in the village during the day. I think us being there did make attendance better and the teacher noticed that the behaviour was a lot better too,” said Orlaith.The Derry News put it to Orlaith that she could have easily spent her summer backpacking in the region as opposed to volunteering-so why did she become involved “I just thought whenever I was reading on it that it made feel how lucky I was to come from here and because Cardf University gave us the chance to go and do something-I just really wanted to help then.“Some of my friends went to Africa this summer to test eyes, but I couldn’t do that because they are a year ahead of me in their studies. When I looked into Think Pacic I thought that it would be a good idea and I can always go back thereI want to because now that I’ve volunteered there will be an opportunity to go back as a leader next year.“So, I could lead a group of people that were in my position this year. Then you can go on to be a project manager and oversee a few dferent teams.“When I got there at the start I thought ‘what am I doing here on the other side of the world ’ There was no Wi-Fi, barely any signal to call home. I actually bought a ‘brick’ phone so I could call home, but it was very limited, I had to stand in certain parts of the area to get a signal.“But, once I settled in that you saw how rewarding this was because the children improved each day and the people are so friendly. They have nothing, but they never complain or never in a bad mood. The people are very community based soI was walking through the village at night dferent families would be calling me in to eat dinner with them.“It was very rare for my and my family to be eating dinner alone because there was always loads of other people in our house eating with us because they invite everyone in. Even when we were getting a bus to the village,you shout ‘bula’ that means hello, but it also means ‘be given le’.“Everyone says hello to everyone . I thought it was quite similar to home because we say hello when we walk past someone in the street, but at university in Cardf people don’t do that. They put their heads down and walk on. I found that the Fijians are quite similar to Irish people because home and family are close to them, but they take it to the next level by inviting everyone it and checking how people are.”Anyone wishing to volunteer for Think Pacic must be between the ages of -. You can apply when you’re  but must be  before your expedition begins.

To provide housing support services to prevent problems that can often lead to hospitalisation, institutional care or homelessness.And finally, to assist with a smooth transition to those leaving an institutional environment to independent living.Following a review of the Supporting People programme by the Department for Communities in , it was recommended that payment rates across all Supporting People providers should be standardised.The new rates are supposed to ensure all schemes represent value for money.However, UNISON Community Branch members have questioned the commitment of certain employers within the sector.Niall McCarroll, UNISON Community Branch Chairperson said: “The Supporting People Programme has at its core the fundamental desire to improve the quality of le of those in our communities who need housing related support at any particular time.“However, the standards of living and quality of le frontline workers are experiencing does not reflect the work they complete, as a result of substandard terms and conditions of employment increasingly pushing them into debt, putting them at risk of homelessness and forcing them to use foodbanks.”‘Amoral employers’The UNISON delegation attending the Public Consultation impressed upon the NIHE that the current measures in place to protect frontline workers were inadequate and gave “unscrupulous employers” too much power. “Power which they use to disadvantage many workers whilst their inner circles led lavish lestyles on enhance contracts of employment,” Mr McCarroll added.He said the decision-making on how to manage staffing is at the behest of Supporting People funded organisations, this needs to change.UNISON told the NIHE that the current consultation process in place, designed to improve service delivery for vulnerable people would achieve nothing and fall short of any objectives,frontline staff were not valued and respected within the programme.The NIHE estimate that frontline workers should be in receipt of band  hourly rates with no mention of other band  terms and conditions such as sick pay or sht allowances. UNISON challenged this benchmarking estimate and its lack of detail in other areas, stating this was not the reality for many Supporting People Programme workers.Mr McCarroll continued: “A UNISON delegation of frontline workers will be meeting with the NIHE to further discuss our members’ concerns and we thank the NIHE for agreeing to continue the discussions on how best to protect and value workers, not forgetting that we are all involved in this programme to work together changing the lives of vulnerable people.“UNISON would like to put on record our appreciation of the position and approach taken by the NIHE in engaging with the trade unions and our continued disappointment at the right wing, anti-trade union position and approach taken by some Supporting People funded employers.“These employers operate with an arrogant, delusionary sense of entitlement, the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign will expose these employers and continue to organise workers to stand up and fight, bringing to an end the increasingly shaky gravy train which stops only at head office, bypassing frontline services.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh\"Head office staff receive  months full sick pay while frontline workers receive just  week in any year.  This particular contractual entitlement along with signicant dferences in take home pay is leaving frontline workers feeling undervalued.\"A NIHE spokesperson said the objective of the consultation is to hear the views of service providers, current and potential service users and their families and carers to enable the Housing Executive to identy the best option and approach for implementing this recommendation.The consultation runs for  weeks, it began on  June  and ends  August .Interested stakeholders are invited to participate by completing an online questionnaire at: https:consultations.nidirect.gov.uk nihe-supporting-people srpr"},{"url":null,"title":"machynlleth carnival 2019 event celebrates","story":"Moon landers : Olivia Garrod , Harry Smithand Izzy Owen ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt drop in on Machynllltspan classtruncate-full-screengteth Carnival.

That total and then some was passed in no time and has now risen above the pound, mark which has delighted Jeff.ldquoMany thanks to all the sponsors, supporters, players, umpires and scorers, Jeff enthused.ldquoThanks also to Liz Byrne, Jackie Wilson and Dave Crudgington who ran the refreshments and food made by chef Ryan Finnegan. We just couldnrsquot have achieved our target without the help of a lot of people and I can never thank them enough, he added.Sunday was an emotional day for Jeff and he was at times reduced to the odd wee tear.ldquoRodney Hassardrsquos tribute had me close to breaking down, but I was able to hold it together. I got my wish of playing alongside a lot of my former team-mates and I am indebted to them all for turning up and sharing the occasion with me.In the first challenge game of the day Dundrumrsquos current first team took on a squad of former Dundrum players that included Alan Mills and Darren Oldroyd, from Drumaness, Mark Yeates, from Downpatrick, and Byron Woodruff, from Saintfield.The game was competitive to say the least and thanks to decent knocks from Terry Hutley , Stuart Campbelland Sean CameronDundrum posted .Yeates sent the stumps cartwheeling on two occasions with Oldroyd also picking up two wickets. Harry Hitchins got the prize wicket of first team captain Ian Wright.The golden oldies rolled back the years in reply with Rodney Hassardshowing his undoubted class in his first game in five years.Woodruff made , including two big sixes off Cameron and Shilliday danced his way down the wicket, as used to be the norm, for a quick fire . Oldroydand Yeatescompleted the job with five wickets to spare.The second game saw some excellent ball striking and decent bowling from an NCU Select team.Saintfieldrsquos Byron Woodruff and the best young prospect in County Down,  year-old Adam Reid, treated all the bowlers with contempt as the runs flowed quicker than the refreshments.Man of the match Reid hit  not out in only  balls including eight boundaries and one massive six that went out of the ground.Superb all rounder Woodruff showed his old team-mates what a talent he is, hitting  in  balls with four big sixes and the same in boundaries.If both had not retired they would have scored centuries and the Dundrum bowlers were happy to clap them off. Ricky Owens then rolled back the years with a splendid , including three big sixes and three fours, the NCU side posting .It was perhaps fitting that Alan Mills, the oldest player on the pitch and still ultra competitive, finished  not out.Dundrum fought back well after the early onslaught with good fielding catching and astute field placing by captain Gavin McNerlin.Wickets were shared around with Chandar Shekhar the pick of the bowlers, taking  for  of three overs. Shilliday was again on the money and finished with  for . McNerlin, Keba Butler, Neil Reilly and Peter Calvert all got one wicket apiece.Dundrum got a steady start from Greg Hutleyand Rodney Hassard before Drumanessrsquo Neil Gelston removed them both. Oldroyd then hit the middle stump with successive deliveries leaving Dundrum on  for .McNerlin hit Gelston straight over the scoreboard in his  before Stuart Campbellwas run out by Woodruff. Saintfieldrsquos T McCavera picked up two wickets with CIYMSrsquo Steven Hughes and Woodruff also getting in on the act.The last wicket partnership of  between Neil Reillyand Keba Butlergot Dundrum closer than it looked as the NCU side ran out comfortable winners.The match ball sponsors were Bao and Bento and Pizza Palazzo, Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Downpatrick railway’s first afternoon tea event is runaway success  ","story":"THE Downpatrick and Co Down Railway got out the best china when it hosted its very first afternoon tea event recently.The experience started with guests boarding the train at Downpatrick town station and taking a relaxing journey, travelling in a comfortable s carriage, to Inch Abbey by steam train.They then boarded the buffet carriage where guests were welcomed by the volunteers with a glass of prosecco, wine or a soft drink, before being directed to their allocated tables to enjoy a mouthwatering selection of freshly handmade sandwiches, luxury homemade scones with jam and cream and mini French patisseries.Guests were also offered bottomless teas and coffees, or their own pot of luxury specialist tea.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner, who was one of the servers, said: ldquoThis is something wersquove wanted to do for some time, and itrsquos always been a very popular treat on heritage railways in Great Britain.ldquoNerves may have been a bit jangled as with all first events.

If something does not happen soon we are finished, he said.ldquoTo be owed something like pound, by a public body like the Housing Executive is scandalous and someone should step in to sort this mess out.The crisis has been sparked off by staff shortages and industrial action in the accounts department of the Executive.A spokesman for the Executive said they were extremely concerned at the situation and had brought it to the attention of the Government.ldquoThere have been a number of vacancies in the department and we are unable to fill them because of the Government ban on recruitment to the public service. The result is that we cannot porocess these settlements as quickly as we normally do.He added: We are trying to do all we can to help the smaller contractors who are always much more vulnerable in such a situation.NEWCASTLE mdash A verdict of accidental death has been ed on Newcastle motorcycle ace Tom Herron, who died at the North West  earlier this year.Thirty year-old Herron, ranked third in the world, came off his bike at mph and smashed into a lamp post just  yards from the finishing line in the cc race. He died in hospital two hours later.The inquest at Coleraine heard how Herron had ridden in the race with an injury to his thumb and arm, but the pathologistrsquos report could not determine whether this would have interfered with his ability to control the bike at high speed.Two police constables, who witnessed the accident, told the inquest that the bike scraped the ground and the rider then lost control.The coroner, Mr Robin Wray, discounted suggestions to close the Portrush circuit and said that the racing gave a great deal of pleasure to a lot of people. He added that he had seen Herron race many times and always had a great admiration for him.DRUMANESS mdash Fresh hope for the old Drumaness Mill, which was becoming something of a white elephant, emerged this week with the news that Irish Waste Services have long term plans to develop it into an industrial estate.This week a spokesman for the company confirmed they had already moved on to the site. The long term plans for the , sq ft red brick building involve the setting up of an industrial estate with potential for several hundred jobs. The firm will advertise shortly for tenants and the spokesman explained that there was a real need for small factory premises providing employment in the area.The story of the mill since it closed down when owned by Hurstrsquos as part of the Ulster Weaving Group, when at one stage it provided work for  people, has been a long saga of disappointment.The mill was sold to Irish Waste for around pound, recently. This figure falls far short of the original asking price at a public auction held in Ballynahinch last year, which was believed to be around pound,.The news of employment hopes for Drumaness was welcomed by the chairman of Down Council, Mr Eddie McVeigh, who said it was ldquogood news indeed.He added: ldquoI would welcome anything which would bring jobs to the Drumaness area and I hope that this is not one of the many disappointments which we have suffered over the last few years.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Plessey Telecommunications in Ballynahinch was closed on Monday when more than  production workers walked out as part of a national campaign to obtain shorter hours and more pay.The strike action will be repeated on the Monday of the next two weeks and the production workers are also refusing to work overtime.Their demands are for a basic skilled rate of pound, a reduction in hours to an eventual  hours a week and two extra daysrsquo holiday.A spokesman for the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions said: ldquoWe would have prefer to have obtained our realistic claim by mutual agreement with the employers, but unfortunately we are left with no other alternative.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A strong plea is being made to boat owners on Strangford Lough to combat the nuisance caused by inexperienced owners of large fast powerboats.It comes from Mr T W McKee, of Sketrick Island, a noted yachtsman with more than  yearsrsquo sailing experience behind him.He is annoyed by a recent ldquomafia-type display of outrageous aggressiveness by a powerboat owner and would like to find an authority with the power to control such ldquoblatant abuse of delightful waters, not to mention the risk to innocent people and their boats by sea-borne thugs.In a letter to the Recorder, Mr McKee describes how his -foot yacht was rocked from side to wide so viciously by the wash of the powerboat, which buzzed around it, that his family and grandchildren were lucky not to be seriously injured as they were flung back and forth across the wheelhouse.He has passed the complaint to the Coastguard in the hope that they can have action taken, but understanding that use of Strangford Lough as a navigable waterway is free to all who wish to use it, he does not expect any success.PORTAFERRY mdash A public meeting is to be held in Portaferry next week to protest about plans for sewage disposal in the town.The meeting has been called by the local development association, which is concerned that the scheme about to be launched will be inadequate.Councillor Paddy Doherty, a member of the development association, appealed for the support of townspeople to support the meeting so that plans can be drawn up to combat the scheme by Ards Borough Council.Mr Doherty said the council originally proposed a filter bed scheme, which would pump treated sewage into Strangford Lough, but then abandoned the filter bed idea.LOUGHINISLAND mdash It was a historic day for the community in Loughinisland when Paddy McFlynn, the president of the GAA, declared open their new Macartan Park on Sunday.The weather certainly could have been kinder for the biggest day in the history of the club, but nevertheless there was a good crowd to witness the opening, as well as the football and hurling games.Mr Vincent Doran, the chairman of the club, welcomed the distinguished guests and said Loughinisland was one of the oldest clubs in East Down.

A few weeks ago Clonduff would have been regarded as red hot favourites to progress against their Division  opponents.However, it is uncertainthe Hilltown outfit will be at full strength as several of their players headed off to the USA a fortnight ago.Clonduff were beaten - to - on Friday night by Burren and given half a chance, Pat Havern and Daniel McCarthy could take full advantage of Clonduffrsquos misfortunes and lead Saval to a surprise win.The curtain-raiser for this game is the IFC encounter between Drumaness and Glasdrumman at .pm. Drumaness are expected to progress as the Quarter Road outfit have yet to win a game this season and seem certain to be relegated from Division .A Gary Murdock-inspired Drumaness beat Glasdrumman - to - at the start of July and they will be intent on repeating that result.There are two IFC games also down for decision over at Fontenoy Park when Drumgath face Darragh Cross and Teconnaught clash with St Johnrsquos.Darragh have been involved in a tense battle for promotion into the top flight, but recent defeats to Carryduff and Longstone have dented their aspirations.However, they are a championship team and in Shane Murray, Michael Monan, Joe McKinney, Matty Hardy and Anton McGrattan they have players capable of going all the way this year and Drumgath, who lie in second place in Division , will do well to get a result.The Teconnaught v St Johnrsquos derby should be a nice opener for the Drumnaquoile side who are more than holding their own in Division  with John Clarke, Conor Morgan, Marty Keenan and the Flanagans all in good form.Teconnaught, who won the JFC title last season, will rely on Paddy Grant, Jack Larkin, Ciaran Carville, David Kelly and Tony Davis to keep them competitive.Friday night sees another four games take place mdash two in Burren and two in Newcastle.A lot of focus will naturally fall on the SFC game between Kilcoo and An Riocht in Burren.Kilcoo have made no secret of the fact that they are determined to regain the Frank OrsquoHare Cup after losing out to Burren in last yearrsquos decider.They have blooded several new faces this season and are well in the running for the ACFL Division  crown, but they will not be taking An Riocht lightly, despite theirindferent season in Division . The Branagan, Devlin, Laverty and Johnston brothers will ensure Kilcoo go into the game in the right frame of mind.At the same venue, Shamrocks clash with Tullylish with the outcome hard to predict.Tullylish have fallen from grace in recent months and have been cast adrt at the bottom of Division . Shamrocks are in the top half of Division , but it looks asthey have missed out on promotion yet again.The game of the night should be in Newcastle where Carryduff lock horns with Castlewellan in the SFC.D J Morganrsquos Carryduff side seem destined for Division , while Castlewellan are battling to avoid relegation to Division .Carryduff have really made their mark this season with James and Daniel Guinness, Owen McCabe, Ronan Beatty, John McGeogh and Josh Connery all to the fore.Castlewellan are just now starting to get a few of their walking wounded back in action and Sean Dornan, Liam, Donal and Gareth McKibbin, Colly Flanagan, Rory Burns and Daniel Morgan could prove a handful for a young Carryduff side.The curtain-raiser to this game is the IFC encounter between Annaclone and Atticall.Ciaran Branniganrsquos Annaclone have been blazing a trail of glory at the top of Division  and it is unlikely that Atticall, who are  points behind them in the table, will inflict their first defeat of the season on them.Annaclone were held to a - to - draw by a fast-improving Ballymartin side on Friday night, but they still should have too much firepower for Atticall.Saturday sees another four games take place.Top billing goes to the Loughinisland v Longstone SFC clash in Castlewellan.Loughinisland have taken Division  by storm since theirthis season and are riding high in third place after Friday nightrsquos - to - win over a good Warrenpoint offering at Macartan Park.Longstone, on the other hand, are embroiled with Carryduff for an automatic promotion place at the top of Division  and now that Ambrose Rogers and Mark Poland are back to full fitness, this should be a cracking affair.Absolutely nothing separated the sides when they met in Division  last year and the same should be the case on Saturday.Loughinisland will rely on their big hitters Dan Gordon mdash still good enough to be playing county football mdash Jonny Flynn, Rory Mason, Stefan Mason and the McClements brothers and they should progress.This game will be proceeded by the Saul v Bosco IFC encounter.Saul,they can reproduce the sort of form they showed a fortnight ago to beat Carryduff, will be expected to ease past their Division  opponents, but championship football doesnrsquot always work that way.Bosco fell to a narrow - to - defeat away to Clann na Banna on Friday night while Saul were soundly beaten - to - by Bredagh.However, Donnan Ritchie will have his charges pumped up for this encounter with the Arnold, Harney and Mahoney brothers prepared to take the game to Bosco.It will be a short trip down the road to Kilcoo for the next two games on Saturday.Glenn play Liatroim in the IFC at .pm and Bryansford take on Bredagh.Neither Glenn or Bredagh have been causing a stir this season, but now is the time to turn it on. Liatroim should be at full strength with the McCrickard connections finally finished with their county hurling commitments and the Fontenoys might just cause an upset.The big game on Saturday night is the Bryansford v Bredagh game in the SFC.Bryansford have been plagued by injuries to key players all season long, but in Davy McKibben, Ruairi Wells, Danny Savage and Conor Maginn they have the men for all jobs and I would expect them to see off Bredagh.Brendan Masonrsquos outfit hammered Saul on Friday night and in Donal Hughes, Tommy McElroy, Eoin Costello and Conor Francis they have players capable of mixing it with the best, but last yearrsquos IFC winners might find Bryansfordrsquos physicality too much to handle.There are another three games to be played on Sunday.Ballymartin face Clann na Banna in the IFC at Mayobridge at pm before Warrenpoint take on Ballyholland and Burren lock horns with neighbours Mayobridge at Pairc Esler.Ballymartin seem to have turned the corner after a few disappointing results, but they are now operating at full strength again and warmed up for the championship with a draw against runaway Division  leaders Annaclone on Friday night.Clann na Banna are sitting in a comfortable mid-table position, but I donrsquot think they will give Ballymartin too much to worry about.The Ballyholland v Warrenpoint game should be another close encounter.Ballyholland may lie bottom of the Division  table, but Warrenpoint are only four points above them. The lsquoPoint have potential match winners in the Boyles and Ross McGarry with Ballyholland looking to the Murphy brothers, Tiarnan Rushe and Seamus Loughran.The Mayobridge v Burrren game is the tie of the round.Paddy OrsquoRourkersquos side, the defending league champions and Frank OrsquoHare Cup holders, will not relinquish their grip on both trophies without a fight.They have been a little bit inconsistent of late, but bounced back to their best on Friday night with a comfortable - to - victory away to Clonduff, while Mayobridge were beaten - to - by Kilcoo.In Kevin McKernan, Donal OrsquoHare, Liam Kerr and the McAvoy brothers, Burren have the perfect blend of youth and experience, while Maybridge will look to Corey Quinn, Shane Annett and the combative Conor Garvey to keep them interested.Downpatrick and Rostrevor bring the curtain down on the first round of fixtures when they clash in Hilltown on Monday night.The sides met last Friday night in the league at Petit Park with Rostrevor winning - to -. However, Caolan Mooney, who was literally unplayable in that game, is unable to play in the championship and that could well hand the initiative to the Hoops.Downpatrick will again look to big performances from their big game players and they donrsquot come any bigger than Gerard Colllins, Michael Magee, Conor McGrady, Jarlath Branagan and the Turley brothers.Without Mooney, Pete McGrathrsquos side will look to Conor Doyle, John Connolly, Shan Parr and Piras Kane for inspiration..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Great turnout for multi cultural event in Ballynahinch  ","story":"HUNDREDS of people attended the multi-cultural family friendly celebration at The Square in Ballynahinch on Saturday.The Connecting Cultures Event was held to help promote community cohesion and encourage acceptance and understanding of other cultures.In addition to music from all over the world, there were dancers entertaining the crowd, face painting, an exotic petting farm, stilt walkers, circus skills and cuisine from ious parts of the world.The African drumming proved particularly popular, with people of all ages keen to take part.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says. Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%. And regarding foreign direct investment– one of the big business buzzwords here over the last few years – it says “under a ‘no deal’ exit, NI’s FDI attractiveness would be negatively impacted”. “A ‘no deal’ would see losses in the medium to long run of % per annum in the case of the number of FDI projects and of .% for FDI-related new jobs.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/hamilton_hotel.jpg","title":"new  bedroom hotel for titanic quarter","story":"Posted on Monday  July  by John Mulgrew Belfast looks set to get a new -bedroom hotel amid freshly submitted plans for a development across from Titanic Belfast.

We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise.

Editor John Mulgrew looks at the numbers, the analysis and the once household names no longer with us The tattered corner of the Ulster Business Top  list from  probably isn’t the worst way to analogise the then state of the Northern Ireland economy, and a precursor to what was around the cornerWe’ve come a very long way in a decade, and while there are some big and familiar names on the  Top  list, there are firms which have fallen off it entirely, and resigned to the history books post-recession.In former editor David Elliott’s intro to the magazine, it references the fact that most of the accounting periods in the list were just as the downturn was starting to gather pace.Economist John Simpson, writing in the edition, says the “big recession of  and  did not impact evenly across the economy, and recovery will be best seen as a sequence of dferent proportions”.There are some positive things to take from it – including a large glowing image of Victoria Square, which in the more than  years since it opened in the heart of Belfast has become part of the retail fabric of the city.Topping the list at the time was Viridian Group, which owned Northern Ireland Electricity and now includes Power NI as a subsidiary, with turnover of £.bn. However, it made a loss of £m during that period.Second on the list is a business familiar to many. Quinn Group, headed by Co Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, posted turnover of £.bn for the year ending    but incurred a loss of more than £m during the same period. There have been enough column inches written about the business in the years since then to fill many a book – and they have.Among those no longer on the list is developer David Patton  SonsLtd, Armaghdown Creameries Ltd and Ballyrogan Holdings.Many others on the list have since been acquired by some of the now giants in their respective industries.Moy Park is an interesting one. Back then it was still a large player in the poultry sector with turnover of £m.Those fortunes have evidently changed dramatically since then, as the company has held the top spot on the list for the last eight years, and now posts big profits and turnover of £.bn.Meanwhile, WR Barnett is on the  list in position , with a turnover of £m and pre-tax profits of £m. In the last  years, it has climbed the list to comfortably take the number two spot with sales of almost  times that of those a decade earlier.As far as employment goes, it was Tesco topping the list in , followed by Bombardier – which at the time had a workforce of around , people – with Royal Mail and Queen’s University following in third and fourth position.A lot has happened in the years since that list. The economy has slowly but surely gotten back on its feet. Growth has been gradual, and in the last year or so has been sitting at around %, while employment levels and unemployment levels are at their respective positive record levels. However, we are amid the most challenging time for business in a generation and some of the signs, and whispered conversations, are far from positive. As I write this, we still sit on the precipice of whether we secure an agreement on Brexit, or shuffle off the edge without a parachute. Let’s hope it’s the former.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flav_1.jpg","title":"top  moy park takes number one spot","story":"Posted on Thursday August  by Ulster Business From a purely editorial perspective it would be refreshing to have a dferent company head up the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list.But Moy Park has now made it to the top for eight consecutive years, as the poultry processing giant continues to expand both its workforce, global sales and pre-tax profit – firmly setting its place at Northern Ireland’s biggest business, with a workforce of more than , here alone.In the last year, it has grown turnover to just over £.bn, up from £.bn a year earlier, while pre-tax profits have surged by % – rising to £.m in its latest set of accounts, ending December .The business supplies Moy Park branded and own label chicken products to leading retailers and foodservice providers throughout the UK, Ireland and Europe.In numbers, Moy Park processes six million fresh chickens each week, , turkeys a year, along with , tonnes of other ‘added value products’.London-born Chris Kirke replaced long-serving boss Janet McCollum in , less than a year after Craigavon-based Moy Park was taken over by new US owners Pilgrim’s.And around a year ago, Flavio Malnarcicjoined the business – then as executive business director – before taking over as the firm’s chief financial officer.He was formerly business director at JBS Global, and has a senior leadership background as executive director of the poultry and export business in Seara, also as chief financial officer and chief executive at Tyson do Brazil and finance roles in Cargill.“There has been a consistence in the performance. We have been growing volumes… we got to six million birds each week, which is about a third of the UK market. For the UK, it is a signicantly big company.“Looking year-over-year, our performance was very consistent in the last few years.”“For people working there, working for a company which is the largest employer in a country, the top company, it is a source of pride for us.“But I don’t think that drives the behaviour of the team. We are more interested in making sure that our performance is sustainable in terms of margins.“It is nice that we arebut that is not our main goal. We are making sure that we are sustainable, work on quality, safety. There are lots of other things. It’s making sure that we fit our customer needs.“We have a lot focus on that, and we need to be competitive.”And as for growth, expanding turnover isn’t necessarily the main focus, according to Flavio“A lot of the efforts in the last year have been to consolidate the management tools they have in Pilgrim’s. They are very keen on efficiency, so that’s one of their strategies. “ a lot of focus in improving our performance, it’s how we can be more efficient, focusing on a portfolio that feeds our customer base, how we deal with our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
