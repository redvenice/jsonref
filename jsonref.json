There is now a video at the side of Your Spiral View, showing what it is like to pass through. Tate and Eliasson have promised to do better in future.“It turns out that this is about far more than me, a ramp, the Tate, Eliasson,” concluded O’Connor, who clearly spoke for many when she tweeted: “I never get to lose myself in a picture, or wander in a reverie. I am always, ALWAYS aware of my body, how it’s blocking people, how it’s taking up space, how it’s inconvenient and cumbersome.”While the row was swirling around the South Bank, a few miles away curator Clare Barlow was putting the finishing touches to a new permanent gallery at the Wellcome Collection that aims to address these issues. Entitled Being Human, the gallery’s mission is to “explore trust, identity and health in a changing world”. Contributors include several leading disability activists – so one of the first things Barlow had to get right was accessibility.The performer, poet and film-maker Dolly Sen has contributed two exhibits: a charity collection tin entitled Help the Normals, and a medical prescription box named Dignity. “Help the Normals,” she says, “makes a mockery of the charity model of disability, by switching the object of pity and the giver of pity. Dignity is a medication box that tells you that dignity cannot be taken four times a day. Dignity means not begging for my identity, my dreams. It means not begging to be heard, to be cared for. And that is a fight many people who are in the mental health system understand.”Sen, who had episodes of psychosis between the ages of 14 and 30, says starkly that art was “the route to save my life and save my soul”. Has she felt institutionally excluded? “Luckily enough, I have not had problems in recent times,” she says. “But in the mid-00s, I was part of an arts organisation called Creative Routes, which was run by the mad for the mad. We tried to set up partnerships with major arts establishments. One was Tate Modern, who refused to collaborate with us unless we had a mental health professional, to look after us and be an intermediary.“They could not see this was discriminatory and patronising. They also told us if we turned up without this mental-health professional, we would be ejected from the building. We decided to do a mini-protest along the lines of, ‘The Tate only likes mad people if they are dead.’”The Wellcome Collection opened in 2007 and is one of London’s most inclusive museums, its palatial baby-change facilities making it a buzzy rainy-day refuge for mothers with small children. The new gallery is on its first floor, with tall windows looking out over the tree-lined road. Entry is either from one end, up a winding flight of marble stairs, or via a lift that deposits you at double doors in the centre of the room.One challenge, Barlow explains, was to make the first view equally impressive from both directions. Working with the Turner prize-winning architecture collective Assemble, and in wide consultation with disability groups, they created a grid of display cases that splay out across the pale oak floors on black plinths that have been discreetly recessed to allow wheelchairs to get close. Labelling is in braille and audio, as well as written text.In the background towers Yinka Shonibare’s Refugee Astronaut, the centrepiece of a section on environmental breakdown that intersects with three other sections, on genetics, minds and bodies, and infection. So, while admiring Shonibare’s colourful traveller in his afro-print spacesuit, you might be distracted by Pity, a music video of a wheelchair-user dressed up as a vintage Spastics Society statuette and begging in the street to a soundtrack inspired by the Luther Vandross and Janet Jackson duet The Best Things in Life are Free. This is Katherine Araniello, AKA SickBitchCrips, who died earlier this year.Or your eye might be caught by an elegant series of apothecary vases by Tamsin van Essen, their form, shape and texture representing hereditary health conditions, from a cracked glaze of psoriasis to pustular acne and proliferating cancer cells.“The Wellcome Collection exists to challenge what we think and feel about health,” says Barlow. “We tend to do that through work that makes you think or encourages you to explore your feelings.” The exhibits are only partly in place when I visit and she leads me to a bobbly, bell-shaped object apparently composed of bronze and perfume. “Smell it and tell me what it reminds you of,” she commands. “Newborn babies?” I tentatively suggest. “Breast milk,” she says triumphantly. It’s one of the most unsettling museum experiences I have ever had – and that is precisely the point. “It won’t all please everyone, but we hope it will be a unique experience for each visitor. If you come with friends, you’ll be able to have some amazing conversations.”One of the most touching exhibits is a pulpit-like desk and chair installation created by the artist James Leadbitter (AKA The Vacuum Cleaner). It’s the result of a six-month collaboration with children from a mental health ward at London’s Great Ormond Street hospital, who were asked to suggest what they’d ideally like from a carer. (Answer: a big listening ear.) They were also asked to choose objects to fill their perfect rooms. From hundreds of suggestions, 27 were selected and cast from models made by the children. Visitors can hold and squish them while reading handwritten lanyards explaining what each one means to the person who suggested it.Leadbitter is a performance activist whose long-running solo show, Mental, invited people into his bedroom to explore how his experience of mental illness and addiction contrasted with the accounts given in years of official documents, which he gathered through freedom of information requests.How does he feel now that this new piece is finished? “A bit terrified,” he says. “But to have the work of very, very vulnerable children in a mainstream gallery for 10 years makes me incredibly proud. They kept saying adults don’t listen to them, and I know what they mean because I was in hospital as a young person and nobody listened to me either.”As for the objects, when we speak Leadbitter has just delivered the last batch: they include lavender, a tree, a dog and a baby rhino. The poignancy and wit of their choices chime perfectly with Dolly Sen’s summary of her artist self: “I am a broken child, but Sellotaped with glitter and stars.” • Being Human is on permanent display at the Wellcome Collection, London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe04d2f28c2e4914544c03c13531812843e69a51/123_0_3888_2332/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76ccfdbdf875aab458f5b5fdcf18e1d5","title":"ba strike 4300 staff to take part in airlines first ever pilot walkout","story":"Reasons cited include pay dispute, cost-cutting policies and loss of confidence in managementWhat has gone so wrong that British Airways pilots earning six-figure salaries are angry enough to strike? On Monday and Tuesday, the majority of BA’s 4,300 pilots based at Heathrow and Gatwick will down tools for the first pilot strike in the airline’s history. BA would usually operate almost 800 flights a day carrying 145,000 passengers, most of which would have now been cancelled or rebooked.Pilots represented by the Balpa union have rejected this and have asked for the kind of profit share enjoyed by directors, plus an above-inflation pay guarantee.Few people would be dissatisfied with a BA pilot’s pay. Perhaps only Álex Cruz, the company’s chief executive, who is currently paid £1.3m, would be pained to earn a captain’s £167,000 plus allowances. But Cruz firmly believes the pay deal on offer is good enough. When strike dates were announced, he said blame laid “squarely at the door” of Balpa.Cruz added: “I personally believe BA pilots are the best in the world … but I think they have been very badly served by the union.”“And yet almost all of its pilots wanted to go on strike. You’ve got to look at what the company is doing to generate that level of ill-feeling among their staff.”One striking pilot, a long-serving BA employee based at Heathrow, said: “It’s the pilots pushing the union rather than the other way round.“Pilots are logical thinkers, they are not going to be led by the nose, no union leader is going to whip them up. Only management has the ability to do that. Communications from Álex Cruz have made pilots more angry, not less.”Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said: “It’s not really about money, it’s about respect. We’ve effectively been lied to. We’ve given up a serious pension scheme, pay and pay rises when the company was weak – all on the promise that when the company was strong and giving up proper returns to its investors, we would benefit.”BA, which has been approached for comment, said this week that it has “acted with integrity through many months of negotiations” and accused Balpa of backtracking on an agreement.In terms of pure profit, BA’s lean years are in the past. Its generous but burdensome pension scheme has been closed, saving BA an estimated £800m, according to Balpa. The airline is the cash cow of IAG, making more than £2bn in pre-tax profit in 2018. “And now that we’ve asked for a little bit of payback, it’s not there,” the pilot added.Day-to-day gripes associated with cost cutting have furthered pilots’ disenchantment, he said, including slow responses to minor engineering issues – “not a safety risk,” said the pilot “but you wouldn’t expect it at an airline like BA” – to worsening food and accommodation for long-haul flight stopovers.Complaints have headed into a void, the pilot said: “The stress is such that the pilots are trying to say – you’ve not been listening to us.”BA has said the pay deal would take some captains to more than £200,000 a year after three years. The pilot admitted he was well paid, but said other colleagues struggled to reach that point: “Many pilots are working flat out, they are not likely to get a decent pension, it’s a much longer pay scale to progress to higher pay.”According to Balpa, a cadet pilot comes in at about £27,000 and a first officer £59,000, while captains start at £78,000, making about £100,000 a more typical basic wage.While the row is pinned to pay, Strutton said: “There are a lot of factors. BA pilots have lost confidence in the management and direction of the airline. A cost-cutting regime has reduced the quality of the service pilots want to give to the customers, as well as affecting themselves. The cumulative effect is a serious groundswell of bad feeling.”Meltdowns at BA, in particular IT outages, have fuelled that feeling. The power cut that left 75,000 passengers stranded in May 2017 also disrupted the lives of pilots and crew, and they were left to deal with the fallout.“Management decisions are being taken that impinge on the working lives and quality of service that pilots and BA staff can deliver. They feel that quality should be the ethos of BA, and they don’t think that it is,” Strutton said.More strikes could follow. A further walkout is due on 27 September, although BA has yet to cancel those flights, and Balpa has a mandate for action until January.On Thursday, BA furiously rebuffed an offer of new talks and accused Strutton of reneging on an agreement struck during talks in August, which he denied: “Categorically, no, we didn’t shake hands on the deal.”Strutton said he was “running out of ideas to try to avoid the strike”, which he said would be bruising for all parties. “We need to start rebuilding the relationship of trust and confidence, which is so sadly lacking,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e1006f97c45d15c829284daa258ec3be16443ca/0_317_5998_3598/master/5998.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac0caf26caef815d8698ef129a874448","title":"philip greens retail empire faces uncertain future without new funds","story":"Taveta Investments reports £177m loss and warns no-deal Brexit could hamper three-year rescue planSir Philip Green’s retail empire is facing “material uncertainty” about its ability to continue trading without new funds, after slumping to a £177.3m loss last year.Taveta Investments, the owner of Arcadia Group, parent of high street brands such as Topshop, Miss Selfridge, Wallis and Evans, said difficulties refinancing a £310m loan on Topshop’s Oxford Street store, due to expire in December, could mean it would have to raise new funds.It also warned that “difficult trading conditions”, particularly in the event of a no-deal Brexit, might leave it without sufficient cash to deliver its three-year rescue plan.The slump into the red was revealed in the company’s latest accounts, which were published at Companies House on Friday.In a statement accompanying the figures, Taveta said: “There are certain scenarios that could arise in the event of continued challenging and volatile market conditions in the retail sector, including a disorderly exit from the European Union, that would create uncertainties around the ability of the group to operate within the liquidity available from existing funding arrangements.”This was underlined in a similar statement by Taveta’s auditor, Paul Cragg at PricewaterhouseCoopers, who noted “a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the group’s and company’s ability to continue as a going concern”.The accounts cover the year to 1 September 2018, but both statements are dated 30 August 2019, indicating that fears for the company’s future persist even after agreement on the rescue plan.Since then, the group’s interim chairman, Jamie Drummond-Smith, a restructuring expert who was hired to replace Karren Brady, has stepped down. The company is searching for a replacement.One-off costs also include more than £11m in provisions against debts and termination payments relating to Topshop’s Ivy Park clothing joint venture with Beyoncé, which the singer took sole control of last year. Chloe Collins, a senior retail analyst at the industry consultancy GlobalData, said the sales fall was the result of “decreased desirability of ranges and a lack of relevance in a competitive market”. She said Topshop was devaluing its brand with heavy discounting and needed to increase its products’ appeal.The business troubles come after a difficult year for Green. He is facing charges of inappropriately touching a pilates instructor in the US and has been accused of bullying staff in the UK. Green has denied any unlawful behaviour.Despite the losses, the accounts show his Monaco-based wife, Tina Green, theowner of Taveta, was paid more than £23m last year. Taveta redeemed £20m of loan notes and paid interest of nearly £3.4m relating to the purchase of BHS in 2009.The Green family was owed a further £43.4m in relation to BHS, which collapsed in 2016 shortly after Green had sold it for £1, but the accounts show this debt has now been written off.Tina Green has also loaned the company £50m and agreed to invest £50m of new cash to help with its turnaround plans. She was also forced to pump £100m into Arcadia’s pension scheme over three years to win support for Arcadia’s restructuring plan from the Pensions Regulator and the group’s pension fund trustees. Arcadia has put an additional £285m contribution in property assets and cash payments into the scheme.That comes after the family collected more than £1.5bn from Taveta since 2005 including a £1.2bn idend and at least £356m in interest, rent and property deals.Taveta’s highest-paid director enjoyed a pay rise despite poor trading at the group. The unknown executive’s remuneration rose to £1.9m from £1.8m a year before."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/641574924948491497c9b524defd8f127a6ceb45/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=443c3539a3045eee88ec21cb55c427a2","title":"three questions general election brexit remain","story":"Whoever can unite their political tribe, be it Brexiter or remain, is likely to win outWhen answers are in short supply, sometimes the best we can do is try to ask the right questions. Some of those e into legal and constitutional arcana, as experts try to work out how Boris Johnson can climb out of the hole he has spent this last week digging ever deeper for himself. Now that the opposition parties have refused to accede to his cunning plan for an October election, and will next week see passed into law their demand that he seek an extension of Britain’s EU membership, he’s left with a series of unpalatable alternatives – from breaking the law to resignation to tabling a motion of no confidence in himself.Still, even if it’s later rather than sooner, polling day is coming. So here goes with the three questions that will decide the next election and, with it, the fate of Brexit.First, when? Given the procedural chicanery and willingness to trash established convention we’ve witnessed these last few days, nothing is certain, despite today’s move to block a poll before 1 November. What’s at stake here is the context in which the election will take place. Johnson’s preference has always been to face the voters before the exit deadline, lest he be cast as having failed in his “do or die” mission to leave by 31 October. This is the prize the opposition has agreed to deny him, forcing him, they hope, to confront the electorate in November as a failure, guilty of either treachery or incompetence. Their hope is that Johnson’s inability to take Britain out of the EU will pump new air into the Brexit party balloon, thereby splitting the leave vote that Johnson had bet everything on uniting around himself.But there’s risk here too. Some Labour MPs fear that fury among pro-Brexit voters will be at its peak in the immediate aftermath of 31 October, as those voters realise they’ve been cheated of Brexit once again, that London  the elite  Labour  remainers have consigned them to another spell in European “purgatory”. In this view, leavers will rally to Johnson’s cry of treachery, seeing him as their defiant, relentless tribune. They won’t be erted to Nigel Farage because Johnson will be supplying the same populist drug, as illustrated by his slash-and-burn antics this week. According to one former cabinet minister, “He has decided to beat the Brexit party by being the Brexit party.”Second question: what cuts through? Or, put another way, what’s the signal amid all this noise? For those watching closely, glued to Twitter or following rolling news, the last week has been extraordinary. If they’re not sharing pictures of a languid Jacob Rees-Mogg sprawled on the Commons benches, expressing contempt for parliament in physical form, they’ve been gasping at the gall of a Tory PM purging his party of some of its grandest figures, two ex-chancellors included, and at the remarkable feat of a new prime minister losing his first four Commons votes. But how much of that gets through to the vast bulk of voters, who might catch the odd bit of news on TV, a few headlines on commercial music radio or via Facebook? While your Twitter feed was spitting outraged noise at the culling of Nicholas Soames, it’s possible that the signal was “PM fights hard for Brexit.” An example came on Thursday night, when Johnson delivered a rambling speech in front of a phalanx of police cadets, wilting in the sun. In Westminster world, following the entire event live, the focus was on the sinister, Trumpian use of cops as props and on the PM’s bizarre incoherence. But the five-second clip on the Six O’Clock News showed a PM backed by police saying he’d rather be “dead in a ditch” than delay Brexit. Despite the noise, that signal might be all he needed.The challenge is to tell one from the other. Some might be tempted to think that the resignation of Johnson’s brother, Jo, is also a mere soap opera twist of import only to the bubble. Wrong. Pollster Deborah Mattinson of BritainThinks reckons, “The brother thing could be a game changer” and will “definitely cut through.” Labour’s line – “If Boris Johnson’s own brother doesn’t trust him, why should you?” – is hugely powerful, says Mattinson, who notes that focus groups still bring up the Miliband brothers, nearly 10 years after they competed against each other. The sheer human drama of siblings at war is compelling. “It’s the stuff of our lives.”Meanwhile, Labour has to hope that the last two years of triangulation on Brexit will somehow be forgotten and forgiven by committed remainers. Recall that four in 10 Labour voters backed the Liberal Democrats in May’s European elections. How can Labour win them back? In an October election the pitch would have been simple: vote Labour to block an imminent no-deal crash-out from the EU. But if and when an extension has been granted, that appeal will lose much of its unifying urgency. Keep an eye too on the so-called Clause V group that will draw up the next manifesto, in which Len McCluskey and the pro-Brexit figures in Jeremy Corbyn’s inner circle loom large. If what emerges is a manifesto promise of a Labour Brexit, two things will happen. Labour spokespeople will tangle themselves in knots, as they explain that Labour will both seek a Brexit deal and campaign not to Brexit. (For a preview, watch Emily Thornberry’s discomfort on Thursday’s Question Time.) And the Lib Dems will have a chance to make a breakthrough, promising a policy as unambiguously against Brexit as Johnson’s is for it.There are other questions too, of course. Will Johnson be as poor on the campaign trail as he has been this week? Will Corbyn be as good as his backers believe he was in 2017? Or are both now known quantities in the public mind, with little chance of a recurrence of the shifts in opinion that struck two years ago? Will Johnson have the slogan of “Get Brexit over with” all to himself, or could Jo Swinson challenge him by promising to end this national nightmare by revoking article 50?

The venomous pit viper, which is 20-25cm (8-10 inches) long, has two fully formed heads, meaning it has four working eyes and two flickering tongues.Schneider explained that Double Dave’s two heads worked independently of each other, and it would be difficult for such a creature to survive in the wild, because the condition meant it was slow-moving and could be easily picked off by prey.Two-headed snakes often have one head that is slightly more developed than the other, and the heads have been known to fight each other over food, not realising that whatever they eat is heading to the same digestive system.The condition of having more than one head is known as polycephaly, and happens in much the same way that conjoined twins are formed: an embryo that has begun to split into identical twins stops before fully iding.Two-headed animals are considered in many cultures to be a portent of disaster, and they have frequently appeared in mythology. But although they are rare, happening in around one in 100,000 live births in the wild, two-headed snakes do turn up fairly frequently. In recent weeks, another two-headed snake made the news after it was photographed in the Bali resort of Tabanan.In 2018, a two-headed snake even went on tour. Named Tom and Jerry, the 17-year-old California kingsnake appeared as one of the star attractions at the Reptile Expo in Villeneuve, Switzerland.Keeping two-headed snakes alive can pose problems. Photographs of a two-headed eastern copperhead found in Woodbridge, Virginia, last year went viral, and the viper breeder Cooper Sallade, who was looking after it, told Wired magazine: “Since the snake had such an incomprehensible amount of media attention, there was a lot of pressure on me to keep that thing alive.”He ended up gently force-feeding it, because the heads were not well-developed enough to eat independently, but after a few months the snake died.Because of its poor chances of surviving in the wild, Double Dave is being taken into captivity by the Herpetological Associates. “We’ll take care of it,” said Schneider."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5778a8c050bd0222c02661d7b046b0603eb5446/0_0_3500_2130/master/3500.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d813bfe1768b55b17929f0346d80dd47 720w","title":"grandfather readers vintage clothes oxfam fashion","story":"To mark an Oxfam campaign against fast fashion, readers reveal their best secondhand findsFor many fashion lovers, September is one of the most important months on the calendar. Not only does it herald the start of various fashion weeks, but it’s also when many of us ditch our summer wardrobes and shop for the new season’s designs.However, our love of new clothes has become increasingly unsustainable. According to Oxfam, every week 11m items of clothing end up in landfill. And recent studies show the textile industry creates more CO2 emissions than aviation and shipping combined.In an attempt to combat fast fashion, the charity has launched Second Hand September, a campaign that urges people not to buy new clothing for 30 days. To mark the occasion, we asked our readers to share the stories behind their favourite vintage finds.I was in an abusive marriage and during that time I gained six stone. After losing weight, I decided to celebrate my birthday – something I hated doing – and wanted something nice to wear. Being a single mum on benefits meant I had a tiny budget. I found this gem for £4.99 and in a size 10 (I previously wore 18-plus).Now I am a working single mum – I’m the manager of a charity shop. Because we sell mainly children’s goods, I am surrounded by kids all day and they are just amazing. We don’t sell our goods at ridiculously high prices as we believe everyone has the right to access affordable clothes. I often do £1 sales on all children’s clothes so people can buy essential items.I love shocking people when they realise this outfit is from a charity shop and it only cost £5 – £3 for the pants and £2 for the jacket.I give workshops and talk at panels about “hostile environment” immigration policies. I’m always talking about how bad things are, so when I can rock up in my favourite outfits and look colourful and happy, it helps me feel good about the work I do. It also throws some positive energy into the room.Yes, Primark is cheap, however I’ve had jumpers from charity shops that have lasted five years and are still in great condition. The only time I enjoy shopping is when I charity shop. It’s a slower process, of course. You can’t rush it because your dream piece could be anywhere. I hate shopping in high-street shops. I hate the rush of it, I hate that everything looks the same and I’m going to pay loads of money just to look like everyone else.I got a job co-presenting the Royal Academy programme on BBC2 with Kirsty Wark and I needed five outfits, so I went hunting for a few extra tops. Friends commented about how huge my wardrobe budget must have been. In reality, there was no budget and most of the outfits were secondhand, including this one.This top reminds me of my grandfather Hosea. I am basically trying to replicate him in the 70s. He oozed cool. I was first introduced to ‘op-shops’, as they were called in Australia, where I grew up, by my mum and aunty in the 90s. Back then I thought it was very uncool and only wanted to wear brand new Reebok pumps and Fido Dido outfits.I love buying new clothes but friends of mine who make social justice documentaries have taught me to think about the supply chain and conditions for workers, so these days I feel reluctant to just buy new.This is my favourite thing in my wardrobe. When I bought it a couple of years ago, a corner was just peeking out on a stuffed-to-the-brim row of clothes and I thought, ‘I don’t know what that is but, however much it costs, I know I need it in my life’. It still blows my mind that 80s Marks \u0026amp Spencer could have produced something so incredibly vibrant and unique. It makes me smile every time I look at it in my wardrobe – it’s like the sartorial equivalent of wearing a rainbow.I first started charity shopping in 2012 when I was at uni in Durham. I’ve been shopping entirely secondhand from 2016. Because there’s so much variety, I feel more inclined to be creative with my own style.I purchased this jumper from an RSPCA charity shop. I didn’t go into the shop for anything in particular, but when I saw this jumper I thought that it was something I would wear and a great way to recycle something that would otherwise have gone to waste. I wear it all the time – I especially like it with some shirts that I have.I have been buying clothes from charity shops for as long as I can remember. It used to be just a one-off thing to do if I was passing by, but now I try to make a conscious effort to get my clothes from charity shops. I really like buying clothes, but when buying new clothes I always have an underlying sense of the huge problem that this industry is causing for the environment and how much better it would be if more people bought secondhand clothes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9affe0677fd7f4ae935c5ea086126dcf609f6c8/1048_1635_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b67304b978a06793e0359c5c2496db7b","title":"how to wear bourgeois chic","story":"Hit refresh with a back-to-school update that’s on ladylike lines but a bit more tongue in cheek“Bourgeois chic” is a major trend in autumn fashion. I’m not convinced we need to read all that much into this on a socioeconomic level, to be honest. Fashion’s grasp of how money operates in the real world is often pretty sketchy, after all. This is a world where a sales assistant tells madam solemnly that the keyring is £500, and madam is expected to keep a straight face.The significance of bourgeois chic is simply in terms of your wardrobe. This is a change of direction for daywear, so it means new options when it comes to outfits to wear to work. Which is important, because a back-to-school wardrobe refresh can really help this time of year feel like a new start rather than just the end of summer.Even better, from both an economic and environmental point of view, is that much of this new look is, most likely, in your wardrobe already. It starts with a skirt that is a bit shorter and sharper than the midi- to maxi-length ones we’ve been wearing recently. Have a rummage behind the midi skirts that have dominated the last few years, and you may well find exactly what you are looking for. I bought this skirt in J Crew about a decade ago, because I liked how the bubble-gummy colour made the wide pleats feel a bit less staid I still do. When I wore it the last time around it was often with a crew-neck sweater, shirt collar and cuffs pulled out: that Prada-esque haute librarian vibe, for those of you with long fashion memories. This time around, I’m leaning towards a silk blouse, which is the ultimate bourgeois chic garment – and, frankly, just one of the all-time most useful wardrobe standbys.The difference between bourgeois and ladylike, in the fashion lexicon, is that bourgeois is a bit more fun, a little more tongue-in-cheek. So you might go for a blouse with a dalmatian or a leopard spot, for instance. You could swap out the blazer I’m wearing here for a cardigan, but since we’re doing nu-bourgeois rather than haute-librarian you’re going to want a structured, slightly fancy cardigan – I’m thinking a gold button, or a piped trim, or a sequin à la new season Celine, rather than the pen-chewing slouchy kind.The palette is different, too. No more winter florals on a dark background, no more muted painterly tones. Instead you want urbane, sophisticated colours: cappuccinos and milky vanillas, and the pastel shades of window box flowers. Don’t overaccessorise it. Oh, and don’t overthink it, either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6fa4232402b9309692236b262013d1eb33edde8/0_2437_4160_2495/master/4160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0500cc0a7374fce46312aa531b7fa4e","title":"statement earrings and blue lipstick street style from ghanas chale wote in pictures","story":"The annual festival of arts that took place in Accra last month puts self-expression at its heart.

Gentle-voiced and crinkly eyed and played by Mark Rylance, he sees his comfortable equanimity shattered by the arrival of state security officers. They’re led by Depp, who looks more like a skull wrapped in butcher’s paper every day. Evocatively photographed by Chris Menges in Morocco as well as Italy, Guerra’s stately, frequently horrific fifth feature recalls both Kafka’s In the Penal Colony and Graham Greene, with Rylance as a sad sack powerless to stop the ruthlessly mechanical infliction of pain.Chapter headings that cycle through the seasons signpost the unravelling that occurs after Depp’s Colonel Joll arrives for an inspection and begins torturing the locals. A nomad accused of stealing a sheep has his eye gouged out, but not before “admitting” that his people are readying for a full-blown frontier war. That news, as well as the magistrate’s discomfort with the colonel’s methods, is reported up the chain, leading to further intervention from the navy-suited state police. It’s easy to read the film as a not particularly subtle metaphor for fascism or “the war on terror”, and its black hats aren’t so much characters as automatons.Hair slicked back and parted down the middle, Depp sports a natty pair of circular sunglasses that obscure the colonel’s eyes and emotions, if indeed he has any. Working again with the kind of indie auteur he gravitated towards before his 15-year run as a blockbuster star, the actor makes a meal of some of his lines here, but he seems positively relaxed next to Pattinson, playing a variation on the diabolical theme.Pattinson is a puzzle. Such a revelation in Good Time, and charismatically enigmatic in The Lost City of Z, he just as often looks uncomfortable. His performance here is somehow both stiff and overarticulated. At least he gets one of the film’s best lines, when he thanks the residents of the fort he’s terrorised for their hospitality, then scarpers.Greta Scacchi has a thankless role as a cook running Rylance’s household, but the magistrate’s key relationship is with an Indigenous woman (Gana Bayarsaikhan) crippled by Depp’s toadies. His deepening affection for her leads him into the desert to return the girl to her people, and some of the widescreen compositions in this section – of stucco parapets silhouetted against a darkening blue sky, of riders ringed by bands of sun-gold at dusk – have a startling beauty. But the grandeur of the wide open spaces is short lived, and on the magistrate’s return he’s thrown into a cell for treating with the enemy.His rejection by the woman he loves but failed to protect presages a more pointed reckoning, and the magistrate is left, in the end, holding the bag. Guerra has tweaked the novel’s Beckettian coda, and the film’s final shot provides a full stop that is, in 2019, appropriately apocalyptic. The barbarians are us, and the wait is over.

It would be fair to say that Manchester United’s charismatic showpiece signing of the summer and Dutch World Cup finalist is ready for the first Manchester derby of the Women’s Super League era in front of an expected 20,000-plus crowd.“It is a good thing to see that women’s football is getting that big it is played at men’s stadiums,” Groenen says. “We have experienced playing in big stadiums with Holland for a while now and every time I am in the stadium … it is the nice thing about being a women’s footballer at this time because you kind of know where you came from. I remember playing in front of 10 people and now when I go to Holland we play in front of 40,000 and it is nice to still realise that that is not a normal thing. I like the fact we are in that generation where you can know about both.”The Canadian forward Janine Beckie will be stepping out for the blue side of Manchester on Saturday at the Etihad. “Strangely enough, my brother is a huge United fan,” she says. When I signed with City he called me a traitor!The new Manchester United are in their second season, the club’s previous women’s side having been wound up in 2005, and Groenen thinks their re-emergence is important for the women’s game. “It is a bit about the name as well,” she says. “You can get games like Manchester United v Manchester City and that will attract people, so it is really good for women’s football that these sort of games are happening right now.”Saturday’s Manchester derby is one of three opening fixtures that have been moved to bigger stadiums – and it means the Women’s Super League’s attendance records will be falling.\u0026nbspThe biggest crowd to have watched a WSL match is 5,265 for Arsenal’s title-clinching win at Brighton in April, but City take on United at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday, with more than 20,000 tickets already sold. And on Sunday Chelsea host Tottenham at Stamford Bridge with an even bigger crowd expected at the 41,000-capacity venue.\u0026nbspBristol City’s match against Brighton on Saturday has also been moved to Ashton Gate. League organisers say fixtures could also take place on the same day as Premier League matches later this season.“We know that there is a massive potential audience of fans coming across from the men’s game and the men’s clubs across to their women’s team, we are seeing very much a one-club ethos,” says Kelly\u0026nbspSimmons, the Football Association\u0027s director of the women’s professional game.Groenen returns to the league after four years with FFC Frankfurt, for whom she signed after one year with Chelsea. She joined Chelsea as a teenager and now, aged 24 and with a European Championship winner’s medal, she is back hungry for success.“You can imagine that in a club like Manchester United everything is massive and blown up and everything is a big deal,” she says. “You walk in and you feel it is about winning and I have always had that in me as well … with the Dutch team we have been winning some things as well you kind of get addicted to it.”Groenen thinks England is the place to be, describing the WSL as “the fastest-growing league” in a country which “revolves around football”, and Beckie agrees. The 25-year-old spent her career in the US before joining City in 2018.“But I think the league over there could use more players like Keira Walsh or Tyler Toland, our young Irish player who I have been really impressed with since she came in. Keira can just play passes not a lot of players can play and she brings composure to the game they’re the kind of players the NWSL need to see more of. I think both sets of players could learn from playing in the opposite league.”Groenen was the Netherlands’ judo champion for the under-15 age group from 2007 to 2009 before injury forced her out of the sport. She says judo has made her a better player.She also thought it would give her the edge when the team donned sumo suits as part of pre-season bonding. “Before we started I was bragging. I was like: ‘Guys, I’ve got this, I am going to win this’ and it was first round and I was out,” she says with a laugh. “I was on the ground and couldn’t get up.”Now, derby bragging rights are on the table and Beckie says it is time for the public to show their support. “If you look at the numbers from the World Cup, I would say there’s not many excuses for not showing up, right?“If you’re interested, you’re interested. I think there’s 10 girls on our team who will be involved in the England camp, there’s other internationals to see and ticket prices are not outrageous. When people say: ‘This is why I don’t come’ I think you can start knocking those excuses off the table.”How badly do United want to knock City off their perch? “A lot,” says Groenen with a grin. “It is all we have been talking about for three weeks: ‘Let’s smash City, get that out of the way.’ It is not going to be the easiest game to start with. It is a big team and they have been doing well for years and in the Champions League as well. It is a massive game for us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfaedbecc97408e912ef103fd03147a36a9b73f5/108_0_3291_1974/master/3291.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7429f135f93d7c386afd5dce6554a3b5","title":"euro 2020 qualifiers scotland russia wales azerbaijan germany netherlands live","story":"Half-time reading, courtesy of Paul MacInnes:Group I San Marino 0-1 BelgiumScotland 1-1 Russia45 min: Tom Lawrence does the hard bit, wringing an Azerbaijan defender inside-out before attempting to bend a left-footed strike into the far corner beyond the goalkeeper. There is not enough venom on it – but it was the right idea.44 min: That’s a killer for Scotland, a sucker-punch. Russia look in the mood, Steve Clarke’s side frustrated, typified by a meaty challenge by James Forrest on Yuri Zhirkov. Yes, Zhirkov, the 36-year-old former Chelsea man is still going. In Cardiff, Azerbaijan’s Emreli is fortunate – as Harry Wilson was earlier – to escape action after swinging an arm out at Chris Mepham. The defender is riled. Well, that’s 1-1 in the should-have-been-a-red-card-stakes.Right on cue. Artem Dyzuba silences Glasgow. It is decent buildup play but the Russia captain and Zenit striker then seizes on a little good fortune, with his good first touch taking the sting out of the ball – which was inadvertently played into him by Liverpool’s Andy Robertson – before firing low into the corner. That’s his sixth goal in this qualifying campaign. That’s his 21st goal in 37 games.38 min: It remains early days but Belgium being held by San Marino is good news for Scotland, who lead at Hampden Park. As it stands, Scotland would slide above Russia and into second place in Group I, behind leaders Belgium. De Bruyne, Origi, Batshuayi and Tielemans have all been given the nod in Serravalle. Steve Clarke’s side are looking relatively comfortable, if unconvincing. McBurnie has been fairly isolated. Still, long way to go, and all that.32 min: Matthijs de Ligt has headed wide for the Netherlands in Hamburg, where Ronald Koeman’s side remain on the hunt for an equaliser. In Turkey, England Under-21s have re-taken the lead to cap a crazy few minutes in Izmit. After going behind, the Arsenal striker Eddie Nketiah popped up with an equaliser – his second goal of the evening – before Reiss Nelson poked England back in front.A gift for Ryan Giggs’s side. A comical own goal. Gareth Bale steps inside and winds up to take aim from 25 yards. It all seems rather harmless, with an Azerbaijan defender getting a block in. The deflected ball cannons up into the air and Agayev, the visitors’ goalkeeper, surges towards Daniel James, who is ready to feed off any scraps down the left. But as Agayev does so, leaving his goal empty, an oblivious Pashayev somehow erts the ball home into his own net. The ball smacks his back and rolls in. A bizarre opener.23 min: Austria are two goals to the good against Latvia, with Marcel Sabitzer adding a second after Arnautovic’s opener. In Cardiff, Azerbaijan continue to frustrate Wales. Harry Wilson is very lucky to escape without even a booking – there is no video assistant referee in Euro 2020 qualifiers, of course.21 min: The Netherlands have conceded a goal in the first 15 minutes of the match in each of their last three games against Germany: 9’ Werner (19 November, 2018) 15’ Sané (24 March, 2019) 9’ Gnabry (6 September, 2019). Not a good look.17 min: Harry Wilson is fortunate to still be on the field for Wales. The Liverpool winger, who is on a season’s loan at Bournemouth, allows his frustration to get the better of him and, hot-headedly, appears to stamp on Richard Almeida de Oliveira. The Azerbaijan coach Nikola Jurcevic is baffled, as is Almeida. Wilson insists he only had eyes on the ball but he can count himself fortunate – it certainly did not look good. Moments later, Wales appeal for handball after Joe Allen’s cross hit a flailing arm.Serge Gnabry has given Joachim Löw’s side the lead in Hamburg. Lukas Klostermann had his initial effort saved and the Bayern Munich winger Gnabry, formerly of Arsenal, slammed in the rebound. Elsewhere,Ryan Fraser jinks on to his fight foot, whips the ball in, Guilherme, the Russia goalkeeper makes a real pig’s ear of it and John McGinn profits, firing home the rebound from close range. Guilherme really will not want to see that again, with the Brazil-born goalkeeper failing to soak up the cross and instead allowing it to cannon off his torso and into the path of the grateful McGinn, who fires in his first goal for his country. Scotland and Steve Clarke will take that.9 min: Scotland go close as O’Donnell rattles a post! Steve Clarke’s side win yet another – a third in quick succession – and O’Donnell reacts quickest to try and prod the ball home after Oli McBurnie towers above his Russian marker to nod the ball downwards. The ball was whipped in by Ryan Fraser, helped on by McBurnie and very nearly converted by O’Donnell, the Kilmarnock defender who worked under Clarke at club level before the former Chelsea coach assumed charge of his nation.4 min: An encouraging half-chance for Tom Lawrence, with the Derby forward attempting to hook a clever cross by Gareth Bale goalwards. Bale raids down the right flank and dinks a ball into the front post, where Lawrence tries to steer it in but it bounces wide. Wales have certainly began brightly in Cardiff.3 min: Harry Wilson whips in a free-kick towards the back post, where debutant Joe Rodon, who spent last year on loan at Cheltenham Town, is lurking. The defender attempts to stab it home but he cannot ert it goalwards. Rodon, along with his Swansea and Wales team-mate Connor Roberts, has enjoyed an impressive start to the season, with his performances at club level – Swansea top the Championship – earning international recognition.2 min: Wales, and Ryan Giggs, could badly do with a result. Courtesy of the good folks at Opta, Wales have lost seven of their 13 games under the former Manchester United winger (W5 D1 L7), including each of the last two in a row they haven’t lost three consecutively since September 2012 (a run of five). Meanwhile, a energetic start for Scotland, with John McGinn drilling wide from 20 yards.We’re under way in Cardiff, Glasgow and Hamburg.We are just a few minutes away from kick-off – a hearty national anthem or two. And here’s a gentle reminder of what’s in store:Group I San Marino v BelgiumScotland v RussiaEngland Under-21s are level-pegging with Turkey at half-time: Arsenal’s Eddie Nketiah, who is on a season’s loan at Leeds, opened the scoring, converting Phil Foden’s low cross from close range before Dogukan Sinik equalised, slotting beyond Bournemouth’s Aaron Ramsdale. Talking of English goalkeepers ... Austria are in action in Group G – but not in Klagenfurt:Team news news: Gareth Bale starts and captains Wales in Cardiff, while Swansea’s Joe Rodon makes his full debut at centre-back as Ryan Giggs makes five changes. Matthijs de Ligt is in from the off for the Netherlands alongside Virgil van Dijk for their humdinger with Germany. Elsewhere, a debut for Leeds’ captain Liam Cooper in the heart of the Scotland defence, while Oli McBurnie leads the line and John McGinn’s in midfield for Steve Clarke’s side. As for the visitors at Hampden Park, Artem Dyzuba spearheads the Russia attack, as it feels he has done for the past couple of decades no player has been involved in more goals in Euro 2020 qualifying than the Zenit striker (five goals, two assists), scoring more goals than Scotland have managed so far as a team (four).This is actually quite big. It is an evening whereby Scotland enter must-win territory if they have any designs of gatecrashing the Euro 2020 party and Wales badly need to jumpstart their own qualifying campaign, with serious questions beginning to be asked of Ryan Giggs, who remains something of a rookie manager. Then there is the small matter of old foes Germany against the Netherlands in Group C, currently topped by Northern Ireland, who welcome Joachim Löw’s side to Belfast on Monday.Scotland have to navigate a way past Russia at Hampden Park, while Wales need to get back on track after successive defeats and given Azerbaijan have not won a European qualifier away from Baku in 31 attempts, everything points towards victory for Giggs’s side in Cardiff. Wales are desperate to close the gap to Group E leaders Hungary, while Croatia and Slovakia are also ahead of them. Azerbaijan, who have conceded 10 goals in three qualifiers, are managed by Slaven Bilic’s former assistant, Nikola Jurcevic. Scotland take on Russia, who are second placed in Group I, with leaders Belgium taking on San Marino. Steve Clarke’s side kick-off six points off the pace but there are reasons to be cheerful in Glasgow, with the Scots having won their past five competitive matches on home soil. “It’s about time that we as a nation, rather than being on the receiving end, are dishing out a result that’s deemed an upset,” Clarke said. “Hopefully Friday can be the case.”As for that tantalising match-up in Hamburg, Ronald Koeman has been at pains to play down the significance of yielding victory. “The duel with Germany is not a key match,” the Dutchman said. “We have to get 12 points against Estonia and Belarus and be better in the two games with Northern Ireland.” Elsewhere, Gareth Southgate and Marcus Rashford have been speaking at Wembley ahead of England’s game with Bulgaria, while, for the Under-21s, the road to Hungary and Slovakia for Euro 2021 begins.

Her father was violent to our mother and later imprisoned. After his release, an uncle bought him a one-way ticket abroad and my sister didn’t see him again. She was still a child and was sent to boarding school, and this uncle assumed the role of male .Understandably, my sister was jealous of me. My father was loving but not used to children, and struggled to form a good relationship with her. I’m sure the difficulties were compounded when her elder brother died, when I was a baby.Happily, our relationship improved enormously after our mother died a few years ago, and she has told me about her efforts to trace her father. She remains angry with our mother for blocking previous efforts to find him. I can empathise deeply with her.A cousin recently told me that she has evidence that the man my sister believes is her father is not. She has told me plausible but ultimately unprovable stories about who she believes the real father is. However, he is untraceable.I now have a secret and a dilemma. My cousin won’t talk to my sister because they don’t get on. So far I have done nothing, because I’m not sure what good will come from my sister learning something so seismic, that cannot be proved. The alleged “real” father will almost certainly be dead now.Ours is a family of secrets and shame. I don’t want to perpetuate this, and wonder if I am right to withhold this information from my sister. Equally, I don’t want to stir up more hurt, anger and confusion. My reading of your letter is that you want your sister to have this information, but you don’t want to be the one to have to tell her. And the fact you’ve written to me, and didn’t just tell her the moment this information became available to you, shows that you know her reaction will impact not only on her, but also on you and your relationship with her. It was interesting that when I asked for clarification on which details I should omit from your letter in order to protect your identity, and therefore that of your sister (a standard legal procedure), you picked just one thing from the host of identifying factors. In the end, I edited all of those out because your sister shouldn’t learn these things through this column but I do think she should be told, and how you deliver the news is super important.When we pass on news – any news – we are usually just a conduit, so, “I heard so-and-so just got married” is usually pretty harmless. But if the information has an extra dimension that has the potential to hurt or wound, the person delivering it becomes inextricably linked to the news they passed on, and therefore part of the problem. So, “I hear so-and-so just got married” delivered to someone who has just been jilted has the ability to hurt the person hearing it, while the person who is passing it on may be perceived as having an agenda – doubling the complication.Make the news about her, not any history with you, her or your mother – and try to offer any support that you can (if, indeed, you are prepared to do this). I really think your sister would benefit from some therapy where she can talk – alone, safe – about her past. If this is something you can help her to access, that would be a supportive thing to do.I feel deeply for your sister: her father was violent (which she may have witnessed) then he went away, for which she may blame herself then she was sent away at a really tender age. Then you come along and her brother dies. She’s had an enormous amount of loss to deal with, and the adults in her life have behaved in ways that didn’t prioritise her. Whether the news is true or not, we don’t know. But she deserves to know what you know.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

It’s a long way from simply being a picky eaterBefore Harry Smith, now 12, received professional help for his avoidantrestrictive food intake disorder (Arfid), he would eat only baby food. “What we went through,” sighs his mother, Angela Smith, 45, from Sheffield. “We had no understanding of what we were dealing with. Nobody mentioned Arfid to us at all. It took 10 years to realise there was something wrong with Harry, that he wasn’t just picky ... We thought it was just: ‘Harry who wouldn’t eat.’”Angela is a full-time carer to Harry, who is on the autism spectrum. For years, her life revolved around obtaining the foods Harry was willing to eat – HiPP baby food and Heinz toddler meals. Because supermarkets never had enough stock, she would place bulk orders online, purchasing 50 or 100 jars at a time. Harry would take the jars of food to school with him, where staff would heat them up. The other children bullied him. The family sought help from the NHS, but nothing worked. “We had all sorts of suggestions over the years, including starving him, or filling his baby food jars up with adult food to see if he’d eat that,” Angela says. “It put a huge strain on my marriage. We eventually separated.”Iniduals with Arfid – once known as selective eating disorder – will eat only a very limited range of foods and may have significant phobias around trying new foods. Arfid made headlines recently when it was reported that a Bristol teenager lost his sight permanently after suffering damage to his optic nerves caused by malnutrition from eating only chips, crisps, sausages, processed ham and white bread. The anonymous 19-year-old, who can’t tolerate the texture of fruit and vegetables, was given vitamin supplements aged 14, but didn’t take them often enough or improve his diet.It doesn’t affect children alone, explains the psychologist Felix Economakis, who specialises in the disorder and treated Harry. “The older generation say: ‘I thought it was just me, that I was set in my ways. I didn’t realise I had a phobia towards food.’” Economakis has treated patients with Arfid in their 50s and 60s.“It’s not uncommon for us to see children who have never tasted a vegetable,” says Williams. Typically, they get most of their calories from snack foods or “the dreaded chicken nugget”. He tells me about one four-year-old boy whose daily diet consists of water, one apple, cheese puffs and Pringles.When iniduals eat such a limited diet, they can become dangerously nutritionally deficient. “When you hear the word scurvy, you think about pirates in the 18th century,” Williams says. “You don’t think about kids today. But it’s becoming more common.” He has diagnosed six children with scurvy this year, including the four-year-old boy. Children can also become anaemic or develop pellagra, a potentially fatal disease caused by niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency that was largely eradicated in the 30s thanks to food-fortification programmes. “We saw a kid with pellagra this year,” says Williams. “No one sees that.” It is not always as simple as prescribing these children vitamin supplements. In many cases, children will refuse to take them.The causes of Arfid are not known, but the prevalence of junk food in modern diets may be a factor. “Junk food is highly preferred, because it’s full of salt, sugar and fat,” Williams says. Once children start eating junk food, it is hard to wean them off it. “The children resist, object or throw a tantrum, and the parents avoid that behaviour by giving them the diet they want ... It’s hard to get out of habits when they have been established.”However, Williams is reluctant to play the blame game. “I don’t know how helpful it is to blame the parents,” he says. The biggest misconception about children with Arfid is that they would eat properly if they were forced to by their parents – that they are just fussy. “You see a lot of comments like: ‘When I was little, you ate what was in front of you,’ ‘They’re all princesses,’” says Angela. She finds it frustrating. “That’s why that poor kid’s gone blind. It’s not that they don’t want to eat, it’s that they can’t eat.”Economakis treats patients using an integrated approach including cognitive therapy, neurolinguistic programming and solution-focused therapy. “It’s about re-educating the mind about food, not lecturing and saying: ‘Vegetables are good for you.’ That’s not going to work.”After treatment with Economakis in 2014, Harry now eats a range of foods. Angela will always be grateful. “We can sit down now and have a Christmas dinner,” she says. “Five years ago, if you’d said that to me, I’d never have believed you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73eaf12e5bd39fab747fe094d295f30d11d49e8f/0_398_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9bb09ea47a9c51efc2607e7f4463e99","title":"guardian investigations giant tech data","story":"Our head of investigations explains how a new IT system, Giant, has the power to find needles in journalistic haystacksThere aren’t too many places to hide at the . The offices are open-plan and most of the meeting rooms have glass walls.There is one room, however, that has a special status. In recent years, when we have been involved in big investigations, this is the place where reporters and editors have relocated for months on end.Only certain people have been allowed in its general vicinity. For some reason, it gets too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. The curtains are drawn most of the time. And because it’s off limits to the cleaners, it can look like a landfill site, particularly in the run-up to a launch.Our work on Snowden, the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers all began in this room, which is a muddle of “clean” computers, run on separate networks, plugged into secure printers sitting next to oversized bins and paper shredders, one of which blew up from overuse during a panic a few years ago.There is a new addition to this room now it’s a humming, blinking stack of servers called “Giant”, and it will help us, and journalists from other media groups we work with, to undertake complex investigations more quickly and securely.It’s a brilliant innovation – one of a number being developed in-house that, in time, we hope to share with organisations that might find it valuable.Our investment in this kind of technology reflects how investigative journalism is evolving, and while reporters will always be at the core of everything, we have to give them the tools to undertake really difficult work in what is becoming an increasingly difficult environment.Giant is a part of this. It allows us to search and cross-search massive databases in quick time. At some point in the years to come, artificial intelligence too may help us to find important journalistic needles in haystacks piled high with millions of documents.One thing will never change. We rely on sources and whistleblowers to trust us, and to share sensitive information that we aren’t supposed to know about. ’s SecureDrop service allows you to anonymously share files with us by encrypting the contents.Handling this information has become an increasingly important part of what we do, especially if you want to prod and probe the kind of people, businesses, and institutions the  has focused on in recent years.Pursuing the truth behind the murder of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, led by Juliette Garside, or asking questions about the safety of medical devices being put in patients’ bodies, which was investigated by Hilary Osborne and Hannah Devlin in the Implant Files, can lead you to some uncomfortable truths.It is no exaggeration to say that some people and some organisations seem untouchable – because they operate in, or exploit, grey areas where nobody seems to know what is going on. It has been one of the more unnerving things in recent years for reporters to discover that the inspectors and law enforcement agencies that are supposed to be policing these environments are a long way behind us, or not there at all.The official bodies are either too weak or too poorly funded, or both, to properly scrutinise, for instance, how vast amounts of money is being laundered through offshore jurisdictions – or why some people, for whatever reason, have chosen to hide their identities, and their vast wealth, behind an array of shell companies that serve no obvious purpose.In the UK, there is now a tier of super-rich people that is well protected from the police, the Serious Fraud Office and the National Crime Agency. It means certain people and their businesses are actually beyond the reach of the law, and they know it. They are protected by a praetorian guard of solicitors and accountants who have got very wealthy defending clients with suspiciously earned billions.Before we published stories from the Panama Papers leak – a collaboration we undertook with media partners and coordinated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists – we sent about 150 “right of reply” letters to various inidual and businesses in return, we got an equal number of letters from London’s top law firms threatening us with all manner of indignity and humiliation if we dared to publish anything. We were told their clients had done nothing wrong and we had no right to be investigating their private affairs. In short, there was no story – and we had no right to go looking.We published. In the three years since then, more than £200m in fines and back taxes have been collected in the UK, and more than £1bn worldwide. Politicians have had to quit, inquiries have been set up. It turns out there was a story – but a story of the kind that is increasingly hard to tell. Recent legal rulings in the UK have made “breach of privacy” the litigation of choice to frustrate and threaten journalists.We are in a position now where we can publish stories that are factually accurate and which we believe are in the public interest, and still run the risk of having to pay damages.Which brings me back to the secret projects room.  is lucky to have reporters and lawyers who know how to avoid the bear traps laid in front of them. But the last few years has shown how important the technical specialists have become too. To be able to research and tell certain stories, and to protect our sources, and the information they give us, we are having to develop new ways and methods.In July, for instance, we reported how Chinese border police are secretly installing surveillance apps on the phones of visitors. To understand the story, and then to tell it, we teamed up one of our investigative reporters, Hilary Osborne, with one of our developers, Sam Cutler. It won’t be the last time our staff collaborate in this way.There used to be quite a gulf between our editorial and digital departments. Giant shows that isn’t the case any more. The journalists of the next generation – some of them, anyway – will have to blend the skills of both."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8e7d9d37367fa3a368f538363bf038419d66f8e/0_0_1516_910/master/1516.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c8e70a06d3e5d3f03a9b1b30975b6eb","title":"what financial advice would you have given to your younger self","story":"From pension pots to property and investments, we asked three people with a wealth of experience what they wish they had known earlier on in lifeIt’s often said that we regret the things we didn’t do more than the things we did. The road not taken. But these regrets are typically rooted in explicit choices and decisions we’ve made. Often, however, we regret things that we weren’t even aware were options – the roads we didn’t know about. This kind of regret is particularly pertinent when it comes to managing our money. Although we make dozens of choices with our money every single day, we are blind to the options we didn’t even consider.For instance, even if we’re prudent enough to put some money aside instead of spending it on items we hardly ever use, we typically just stick it into a savings account. Or we put it into bricks and mortar. Many of us don’t even consider investing.Perhaps this is one reason why people who have successfully met some of their financial goals often credit the advice and wisdom of those with more experience. So what advice would people who’ve been there and done that give to their younger selves – and others?Debby Clarke, 54 bookkeeper, HarpendenMy advice would be to make an effort. I had no financial education whatsoever and I really wish I had. When I was growing up my dad handled the finances and my mum had nothing to do with them, so that set a sort of example. It didn’t help that when I met my future husband he was more clued up and I found it all a bit boring.Many kids still leave school without a clue now. As parents we took it on ourselves to explain things like budgeting, interest and credit to our daughter and that had the effect of making me make more of an effort.The other thing I’d tell myself is to start a pension sooner. I was in my late 30s when I took one out, but then we put all our money into getting on the property ladder, which I don’t regret. But I realise I should have invested a bit more for later in life now that I’m headed in that direction. I won’t be able to afford to retire early like my parents did, probably not at 65 either – but perhaps that’s not the worst thing.Trevor Levy, 55, financial adviser, LondonPensions seem a million miles away in your 20s and I was no different – even though I ended up working in the financial services industry. I was trying to get people to take out a pension but I didn’t have one of my own for a while. Now, I explain to people that pensions aren’t an older person’s thing. A pension is your long-term financial friend and I should have made friends sooner. People get obsessed by property but it’s about having a balanced set of options to cover all eventualities.Making money was seen as cool in the 1980s. Everyone was buying and trading shares. I didn’t know enough about it but I invested in a funeral firm. I thought: “There’s something that’s never going to run out of business” – but there was no plan and I didn’t hold them for very long. Everyone expected to make a quick buck in that era, but it doesn’t work like that. You need to take a long-term view and have a portfolio to spread the risk.Richard Southgate, 70, retired, MaestegOne piece of advice my dad gave me was: “Spend a bit, save a bit, make the devils wait a bit.” I didn’t quite heed my parents’ advice. There’s probably something in that. They knew stuff I didn’t. They were upper-working class and had to be careful with money.If I could do things again I’d have got on the housing ladder quicker. For my generation property has proved great value. Though obviously it’s much harder to get on the ladder these days.There was a tech boom a few years ago. I didn’t have a lot of money but I wanted to get in on it. I had a financial adviser and he said: “It’s too late, don’t bother.” I didn’t listen and lost a fair bit – so that was a salutary lesson. I have taken advice since and have done OK on the stock market. I learned to ride the ups and downs and take a long-term view. I use a technique known as pound cost averaging, which involves putting a few quid in each month, rather than investing a lump sum all at once. You can’t time the market – the ups and downs average out.Whatever your level of confidence, HSBC could help you make better-informed investment decisions.

But with a bit of careful planning, you can pull it off. We spoke to three people who did exactly thatPutting money aside – whether it’s for short-term goals or major life changes – can be difficult. There’s the unappealing prospect of forgoing stuff, toning down your social life, or taking on a side hustle. But with a bit of careful planning, and a clear goal to motivate you, you can pull it off. We spoke to three people who did exactly that.To overcome the daunting prospect of putting away thousands of pounds, she broke her goal down into setting aside a few hundred pounds from her salary per month. When Sarah eventually started The Gluten Free Blogger alongside her day job, she set a new goal: to put away all the money she raised from the website. “It made it easier knowing I didn’t have to sacrifice everything and could still live my life, by funding my savings goal through a side hustle I was passionate about,” she says. Sarah’s savings plan was fairly traditional – using an ISA to build savings and putting away a little each month. Eventually, she shifted to a savings account that gave her better interest rates.Sarah recommends that anyone trying to save for a mortgage should set a monthly goal and stick to it. “I enjoyed being able to save and spend at the same time, but in hindsight it would have been nicer to commit a set amount each month and perhaps reach my goal a little quicker,” she says. Day-to-day she made small sacrifices, such as eating out less and forgoing takeaway coffees. She also decided to put off some overseas holidays until after she had raised her deposit. “As the end came nearer, it felt easier to somehow find the money.” Her next goal? Finding her dream home.She set up an investment portfolio and chose a lower-risk option. “I have always tended to take guidance and invested my money, I got an insurance policy paid out and it was all invested, for example.” Kay says that it was simple enough to amass the capital she needed to invest, by living a little more modestly. “It’s not the fact that I don’t like spending, but I’m just an ordinary, day-to-day person – I don’t yearn for fancy things,” she says. I’m very content. If I can live like I’m living now from today until tomorrow, I’ll be more than happy.”How to save to travel the world as a volunteerDorothy Selleck, 86, has spent 40 years travelling the world, volunteering in schools via the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education (OMEP). While she was still at university, Dorothy, who speaks Welsh as a first language in addition to multiple other languages, was approached by a friend who convinced her to use her skills in charity work. For weeks at a time, Dorothy would take time out from her job as a school’s inspector and visit places around the world, including Japan, India and South America. “We were still at our jobs – you couldn’t leave them for very long, but you could leave them for long enough,” she says.Dorothy paid her own way volunteering. Flights, accommodation, travel expenses and a membership fee to OMEP were funded through a full-time job and living a modest lifestyle. “I didn’t spend a great deal of money on myself,” Dorothy says. As well as setting up four separate savings accounts where she could budget her money for travel and day-to-day living expenses, Dorothy put some of her money into a house and approached HSBC for guidance on setting up an investment portfolio.Dorothy says being afforded the freedom to volunteer has allowed her to see hidden corners of the world and master three languages. Even now, long after her retirement 27 years ago she still volunteers at schools a few days a week – although much closer to home. “I’m still doing voluntary work,” she says. “It’s very important to me.”Top tips for saving for a major life goalInvestments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in.

The amount you have will determine what sort of plans you can turn into reality.Putting together a financial plan for each of these defining moments can give you greater freedom and choice. You’ll be able to enjoy each stage without worrying so much about money issues.If you are financially secure, you can take more informed decisions about moving jobs or changing career you may even get better deals on products such as mortgages and loans and you’ll have more time to spend on the things that matter to you – like leisure, travel and family.Taking time to set goals, thinking about what your priorities are, and putting in place a savings scheme for the future are all essential elements in good financial planning. The good news is that it’s never too early or too late to start.You would imagine that you need a lot of money in order to start saving or investing. In reality, even relatively small sums can grow into a sizeable nest egg over time.The real secret of financial planning is making regular contributions and sticking at it over the long term. Building personal wealth is not a quick fix. Taking a lot of risk with your hard-earned cash in the hope of securing a short-term gain could be counter-productive.Instead, you should think of managing your money as a lifelong strategy and the key to future freedom, which can change and adapt as your personal circumstances change. When you are younger, you might take a little more risk and perhaps consider investing as a way of protecting your savings against inflation. In retirement you might need to think about how to protect your funds against sudden falls in value.Whatever age you are, the best way to start is to put away a bit of money at a time and allow interest to accumulate and investments to grow. If you save or invest into an inidual savings account (Isa), then everything you earn will be free of income and capital gains tax – giving your savings plan a boost.If you think of managing your money as the key to freedom, rather than a chore, you gain a new perspective on your finances. There are three key elements to planning for the big events in your life: setting goals, making it a habit, and reviewing your progress.What do you want to achieve with your savings and investments? Identifying a tangible goal – such as saving up a deposit for a home, being able to afford a wonderful honeymoon, or taking time off work after the birth of a baby – can be more motivational than having a vague idea of saving for some undefined future event. It’s important to have a rainy day fund first, for those unexpected events, so you won’t need to dip into your goal pots in troubled times.Now build in a timeframe – when will you need the money? What will you need to do in order to start saving? How much can you start with and could you make savings in your monthly spending in order to free up some spare cash? Small changes can make a big difference over the long term. For instance, if you have one less takeaway coffee at £3 a day, this equates to £15 a week, which over a year will amount to more than £700.If you have multiple goals, split your saving priorities into pots of money – short term, medium term and long term. Short term might be money for a fantastic honeymoon or overseas trip in a year or two medium term might be wanting to save for a house deposit over five or six years and long term will be your retirement planning.When you are clear about your goals and your timeframe, then you can start to think about the best home for your money.For funds you want to access within the next five years, you might consider a deposit account. You can make small incremental payments into a savings account or cash Isa. Moving money from your current account to a savings account on the day you get paid, or setting up a standing order, will mean you’re not tempted to spend it. However, as many of these are instant access, you’ll need to be disciplined about not touching it. If you think you might be tempted, consider a fixed rate savings product that locks your money away, often in return for a better interest rate.If your goal is five years or more away, you could consider investing in a variety of ways, at different levels of risk. Although these carry a higher risk than cash savings, they can also protect your money from the effect of inflation if your investments outperform the rate of interest offered by savings accounts. As you start this journey, it might be wise not to chase big wins or follow fashion – but instead to opt for a slower but safer approach, perhaps choosing funds that invest in a broad range of shares rather than trying to pick inidual companies. There are many sources of information about market trends, and it’s always good to become familiar with these.Any money you put into Pension savings has the benefit of being boosted by tax relief, but you can’t access the fund until you’re at least 55 and it’s best to wait until you retire. You should join a scheme at work if they have one, or save into your own private pension.It’s easy to start off with good intentions, and then forget to continue because of a lack of time or motivation.The key to successful money management is automating your financial commitments. Set up a regular amount to leave your bank account and be paid directly into your Isa or savings account. That way, the money has moved before you spend it, and you never have to set a reminder.Playing the long game can work in your favour, because the interest you build up in a deposit account will accumulate naturally. If you are investing for the long-term in the stock market, you’ll be less concerned with the short-term ups and downs of share prices. Sometimes people approach saving and investment in an emotional, rather than a rational way.It’s easy to buy shares when the stock market is doing well, and then panic after they have fallen. Try to take a long-term view, and check how your strategy is working for the long term, rather than from month to month. Remember: investments should be viewed as a five-year commitment, so make sure you think of these as a long-term strategy.Investments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in.

With MPs agonising over the gravity of the current political crisis, the member for Somerset North East nonchalantly closed his eyes and rested.For some MPs in the chamber on Tuesday night, it was the moment the man nicknamed “the honourable member for the 18th century” lost any remaining anachronistic charm.Rees-Mogg had gained a reputation among some parliamentarians and the public as a winning curiosity. His politeness, deft use of parliamentary procedure and precise pronunciation of 29-letter words like floccinaucinihilipilification won over those who disliked his populist politics. During appearances on the BBC’s Have I Got News For You and several magazine programmes, he is asked about his decision to campaign during an election alongside his nanny or to name his sixth child Sixtus.But his nonchalant posture enraged MPs on the opposition benches as they debated a plan to shut down parliament amid warnings of a wrecked economy and medicine shortages. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion, had watched Rees-Mogg slouching for at least an hour before she finally took him task.“The leader of the house has been spread across three seats, lying out as if that was something very boring for him to listen to tonight,” she said.Other MPs shouted “Sit up!” and “Sit up straight!”Looking both embarrassed and defiant, Rees-Mogg shook his head, before adjusting his glasses.But by this point, social media users across the globe who were watching the debate had begun to respond with dozens of creative memes.The reclining Rees-Mogg was superimposed dancing with the 1980s ska band Madness, high-jumping the Fosbury flop and dropped on to the sofas of The Simpsons and Friends – renamed “No Friends”.Lucas said the public response to his unusual parliamentary pose has been magnified by the importance of the debate.“It does demonstrate an extraordinary confidence and a sense of entitlement if you literally take up far more social space than anyone else, and that manifested itself in looking so contemptuous of everyone else. I think he has suddenly learnt that what you can get away with on the backbench you cannot do on the frontbench. This is an image that is going to follow him for many years to come,” she said.His performances at the dispatch box – he was accused of being dismissive of questions posed by remain-supporting colleagues – enraged some of the 21 Tory MPs who voted against the government that night.Here is the list of the 21 Conservative MPs who voted with the opposition and against the government on Tuesday night’s motion to seize control of the parliamentary timetable in order to pave the way for a bill to block a no-deal Brexit.Philip Hammond, Runnymede and WeybridgeCaroline Nokes, Romsey and Southampton NorthRory Stewart, Penrith and The BorderSoames told the : “Jacob Rees-Mogg’s performance, his rudeness and casualness to colleagues, shows he just doesn’t understand the way it works ... it was just bloody bad behaviour, you wouldn’t see Andrea Leadsom lying about.”Chris Bryant, the Labour MP for Rhondda and former deputy leader of the house of Commons, said Rees-Mogg’s performance in the house has failed to take into consideration the government’s weak position. “The thing about the leader of the house job, is you have to do it with a great deal of grace, especially when it’s a minority government. Leaders with pointy elbows don’t tend to get much done,” he said.Rees-Mogg’s week went from bad to worse on Thursday when he compared a consultant who helped draw up no-deal medical plans to the disgraced anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield. Rees-Mogg eventually apologised following pressure from Westminster colleagues and the chief medical officer of England, who said that the leader of the house’s comments about the respected neurologist David Nicholl were “disrespectful”.Rees-Mogg was elected to the Commons in 2010, but his profile rose considerably in the wake of the 2016 Brexit referendum when his calm performances in front of TV cameras led him to being seen as a possible future prime minister. Queues for his speeches at party conference snaked round buildings, and Moggmentum, an online conservative campaign and grassroots movement supporting him was created.The son of the former Times editor William Rees-Mogg, he dismissed questions last year about investment funds established in Ireland by Somerset Capital Management, a firm he co-founded. SCM had warned investors about the dangers of a hard Brexit as Rees-Mogg spoke out about “scare stories from project fear”.He has also refused to bow to mainstream views on abortion, which he opposes even in cases of rape.But Andrew Bridgen, the Eurosceptic MP and a close colleague of Rees-Mogg, said his difficult week should not detract from his talents.“It is clear that the opposition see him as a very capable and able leader of the house. They clearly want to get some hits on him because they see him as a threat in what has been a very bad week for the party.“Jacob was the darling of the Labour party when he was attacking May or Cameron. Now that Euroscepticism is mainstream he is the enemy. There is no politician I have met who is consistently more polite than Jacob.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f292bea274f7f8ada2602eee1fb2b59dbe7ed793/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5e8e57c92eba0fc2bb017a07459d3d85 2020w","title":"england australia fourth test day three match report","story":"• Australia 497-8dec: England 200-5• England lose three wickets in final hour on day threeThree late-evening wickets from Josh Hazlewood have left England with a mighty struggle to save this game and keep the pursuit of the Ashes alive. In a six-over spell just before the intervention of bad light Hazlewood dispatched two of England’s most adhesive batsmen, Rory Burns and Joe Root, who had assembled a dutiful partnership of 141. Then he clean bowled Jason Roy, who attracts many adjectives which do not, however, include “adhesive”, whether batting or fielding.So England ended the day on 200 for five, 98 runs short of the follow-on target – though that may not be relevant – and there remains the possibility of another 196 overs in this match with the forecast fine. There is an awful lot of batting to be done for England to draw this game but at least Burns and Root have demonstrated that there is a possible route to survival.Play was delayed until 1.30pm but it did not take long for the Australians to make further inroads. Craig Overton, reassuringly calm on Thursday evening in the unaccustomed role as nightwatchman, was dismissed in the second over of the day by Hazlewood. He pushed forward and edged to second slip where Steve Smith held a sharp chance.So once again Root was at the crease before the score had passed 30. At the other end was the increasingly reassuring sight of Burns, in his 11th Test and regarded as something of a stalwart. Mitchell Starc beat the outside edge of Burns’ bat three times but the Surrey captain remained almost as imperturbable as his predecessor, John Edrich, used to be after failing to make contact. Then Pat Cummins was summoned from the Statham End and he also provided problems, mostly from short deliveries directed at Burns’ chest they were not short enough to duck, yet hard to defend safely. Burns looked uncomfortable without being flustered, one of his great assets.Before long Nathan Lyon was introduced and he found slow, consistent turn. The Australian off-spinner has tormented left-handed batsmen in recent times, yet Burns has played him well with his own idiosyncratic system. Given the slightest encouragement he plays the cut shot. The ball from Lyon does not have to be very short or wide for Burns to rock back on to his stumps and hit the ball away square of the wicket. Often Lyon’s arms would go up in anticipation but Burns, ever eager to stay on the back foot, jammed his bat down in time. It seemed surprisingly easy for this left-hander to get to the other end. The blunt truth is that Lyon has bowled better to Ben Stokes in this series than to Burns. In fact Lyon proved to be much more of a problem for Root, who is usually such an effective player against spin. Yet he was tied down by Lyon and his attempts to break free were seldom convincing. He swept occasionally once or twice he came down the wicket. Yet he was never able to impose himself during a high-quality duel. This would not be one of Root’s silky innings.There was a constant distraction for Lyon. The fans in the massive temporary stand, renamed the party stand, decided to give their full attention to him, focussing on that missed run out at the end of the Headingley Test. Every time the ball was thrown back to Lyon during his spell, they cheered raucously when he gathered the ball cleanly. Lyon and his teammates seemed mildly amused to start with but the impression grew that the novelty was beginning to wear off for the Australians after an hour or so.The partnership was given a boost when Starc returned for his second spell. He leaked 20 runs from two overs, mostly from the bat of Burns, a reminder of why the Australians have been reluctant to pick him throughout the series. As a consequence the pressure eased a little the hundred partnership was posted and it was time for tea.After the break, Tim Paine tossed the ball to his best pace bowler in the series and he got the appropriate response, but no immediate reward. Cummins bowled another fine spell that was hostile and accurate. His short balls troubled Burns, his fuller ones Root. When England’s captain was on 54 he flicked towards the leg side yet only edged the ball between the keeper, Paine, and first slip, David Warner. Neither man moved and Root was on 58.In his exasperation Paine reviewed an lbw off Cummins, but, almost in the manner of Smith, Root’s leg was struck outside the line of off-stump, another “emotional” Aussie review. Then there was a long delay since Root’s right leg was painful after being struck by the ball. Off came his pad on came the physios and then Root soldiered on. He has seldom scored uglier runs for England, but he was not bothered about kudos for artistic impression.But Hazlewood’s efforts were rewarded. Burns fell – in a typically respectable manner – edging a fine delivery from Hazlewood to second slip and Root was unreviewably lbw for 71. Roy hit three sumptuous boundaries on his way to 22, whereupon Hazlewood removed his middle stump with a ball that slipped all too easily through the gate. Suddenly the route to safety seemed perilous in the extreme."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71875feb0f35a24e9e1d7846025b7a022ebdf217/112_197_4012_2407/master/4012.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b6d39dbf13a52f39b3a6e63314bc82f","title":"formula one italian grand prix ferrari charles leclerc lewis hamilton","story":"An air of hopeful expectation is nothing new for Ferrari fans at Monza. However before this year’s Italian Grand Prix, as vast prancing horse flags unfurled over the tifosi packing the grandstands, it was suffused with an unmistakable sense of excitement and anticipation. Might, these scarlet-clad romantics dreamed anew, the home win drought finally be ended this weekend by the Scuderia’s bright new star, Charles Leclerc?Ferrari have not won the Italian Grand Prix since Fernando Alonso’s victory nine years ago. The demand that they succeed here above anywhere else is always fierce but every year since 2010 the pressure has only become more intense. This weekend history too weighs heavy. It is the 90th edition of the race and crucially the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Scuderia by Enzo Ferrari in 1929.All of which, were it not already enough, is compounded by the fact that Ferrari and the fans know their championship challenge is gone. Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes will surely now claim both titles. A Ferrari win at home the week after their first victory this year in the last round at Spa would surely sweeten was has proved to be a bitter pill this season.“Expectations after Spa are high,” said the Ferrari team principal, Mattia Binotto. “We know long straights are our strengths. But we also know we only finished a second ahead of Mercedes. We know we can do well here in Monza but only if we have a perfect weekend.”What had begun in testing with such promise has fallen away as Ferrari have struggled with their car at the majority of circuits with a weakness in grip through the corners. Monza should indeed play to their strengths of a straightline speed advantage combined with the season’s lowest downforce configuration. They have also brought a new engine here. If there is a race Ferrari should win, it is the Italian Grand Prix.Leclerc, rather than his more experienced four-times world champion teammate Sebastian Vettel, seems to be the driver the fans expect to do it. The 21-year-old took his debut F1 win at Spa and has repeatedly looked quicker and more comfortable with the car than Vettel of late.This is a huge weekend for Leclerc, who wore a smile as he experienced F1 as a Ferrari driver at Monza for the first time as his appearance was cheered roundly during practice. In the model car shop at the heart of the track the proprietors said it was Leclerc’s replica SF90 that was flying off the shelves.Ferrari have been clear they believe in Leclerc as the future of their team and the supporters also sense something special about this young man who has made his debut in the most high profile seat in F1 with almost boyish insouciance. He felt the full force of what it meant as a huge crowd turned out on Wednesday to celebrate those 90th anniversaries in Milan’s Piazza Duomo. “So many people, so much passion,” said Leclerc. “It was just incredible and very, very impressive to see so many people coming together for us and for Ferrari. It was crazy.”This then was that pre-race expectation that comes with the territory, but with it comes the risk of the crushing sense of disappointment when the Scuderia fail to deliver. Vettel knows it well. He won his first of three grands prix at Monza with a Ferrari-engined Toro Rosso in 2008 but has yet to deliver a victory here for Ferrari. “This is the biggest race for us, no doubt,” he said. “Now is the time to sort of over-deliver. It’s a big weekend so hopefully we can make it count this time.”For the fans either driver would be acceptable in taking the flag on Sunday. While, equally, for Ferrari it feels almost imperative that if they are to salvage anything from this season, one of their men simply must master Monza. Early indications are the team have the edge but they can take nothing for granted. Leclerc topped the time sheets in a wet first practice session on Friday. While in the more representative and largely drier running of practice two, Leclerc was once again quickest but with Hamilton only six-hundredths behind him, pushing Vettel into third, two-tenths back.Should similar mixed conditions prevail on Sunday, a battle royale between the five-times world champion and the young pretender is on the cards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cdc47a7d9099faee4482ea371a284292c55300e/0_0_4928_3280/master/4928.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abd8eaaf7ff43d1191670f40f65eff30","title":"ashes 2019 england v australia fourth test day three live cricket","story":"Josh Hazlewood took three late wickets to leave England in trouble at 200 for five, still 98 runs short of avoiding the follow-onClose of play That, officially, is that for the day. We’ll have a match report from Old Trafford shortly. Thanks for your company - goodnight!Despite the irritating end, that’s been another excellent day for Australia. Pat Cummins’ immense 10-over spell either side of tea increased the pressure on England, and Josh Hazlewood reaped the rewards with three late wickets. He took all four wickets to fall today, in fact. England, who need a further 98 to avoid the follow-on, are in serious trouble, again. “Sport on TV being that nebulous, fuzzy thing in the 80s, I didn’t get to watch Abdul Qadir “live” - only in highlights on World of Sport or similar,” says Ben Heywood. “My brother and I were so amazed by Qadir’s loopy deliveries that we resolved to teach ourselves leg spin in the back garden, bowling at two flowerpots stacked on top of each other with a tennis ball. My attempted leg-breaks flew straight up in the air. My brother’s, upsettingly, seemed to unerringly bounce and spit out of the rough that comprised most of my Dad’s lawn, but he did slightly ruin the effect by running twice around the greenhouse first in an attempt to emulate that famous run-up. I’m not sure that’d have been allowed on a cut strip... RIP Abdul. Gorgeous action.” Bad light stops play Australia aren’t happy. Tim Paine was told he could bowl spin at both ends, but the umpires changed their mind after checking the light meter. 74th over: England 200-5 (Stokes 7, Bairstow 2) With the forecast good for the next two days, England are in the nasty stuff. It’s no good just avoiding the follow on, because that would leave Australia with plenty of time to win the match. It’s hard to see a way out. Let’s be honest, Australia fully deserve to win the series, never mind retain the Ashes.“No bowler made a batsman look a mug the way Abdul Qadir did,” says Gary Naylor. “He attacked with every ball and bowled about as dry as me. So very sad.”Yes, it’s the deception that made him so bewildering.73rd over: England 198-5 (Stokes 5, Bairstow 2) It was an ugly lunge towards the ball by Roy, which left a big gate for Hazlewood to burst through. It was a brilliant delivery. “Two things in that Abdul Qadir clip,” says Kristian Petterson. “Firstly, I love Richie saying ‘Oh, what a Bosie!’ Shameful that Bosie has gone out of fashion. Secondly, Gabriel appears to get out exactly the same way twice - going back to try to cut the wrong ‘un - in the same ODI series. What a dummy!”Hazlewood gets his fourth wicket, knocking Roy’s middle stump out of the ground with a big nipbacker. Roy played some nice strokes, including a lovely back-foot drive for four off the previous delivery, but Hazlewood ended the argument in the most emphatic manner.And it’s goodnight from him.72nd over: England 190-4 (Roy 18, Stokes 3) Stokes survives an appeal for caught behind after an impressive bit of juggling from Paine. It missed the edge.“It’d be wrong to say I’m looking forward to reading Abdul Qadir’s obituary in tomorrow’s , but I’ll be disappointed if there isn’t one,” says John Starbuck. “He was one of the greats and should be recognised as such.”71st over: England 190-4 (Roy 18, Stokes 3) An excellent short ball from Hazlewood is gloved round the corner for a single by Stokes Roy then misses a swipe across the line. He has 18 from 29 balls, and there have been signs of encouragement amid the false strokes.“As a nine-year-old watching his first ever Test series on TV in 1982, I remember being mesmerised by Qadir’s whirling action and finger-licking,” says Paul Callinan. “I was also confused and a bit upset that our batsmen were unable to lay a bat on him. I don’t think that any bowler since then has amazed me in quite the same way as he did back then.”70th over: England 189-4 (Roy 18, Stokes 2) Roy drives Lyon crisply through extra cover for three Stokes is then beaten by a jaffa. If England lose any more wickets before the second new ball, they will be in serious bother.69th over: England 183-4 (Roy 14, Stokes 0) Roy is starting to look a little more confident. He played a nice stroke for four off Lyon a couple of overs ago, which I forgot to report after reading about Abdul Qadir. “I’m sad to see that Abdul Qadir has died,” says Chris Howell. “It’s something of a mystery to me that I grew up on the late 80s to become a huge cricket fan, since my earliest cricketing memory is of losing to India and NZ at home in the summer of 1986, followed losing to pretty much everyone else until 1990. But I remember being enchanted watching Abdul Qadir bowl in 1987, and taking myself into the back garden to try to teach myself how to bowl legspin. I suspect that he as much as anyone made me want to watch and learn about this great game.”I think Graham Gooch said he was the best spinner he ever faced, even ahead of Shane Warne.Here’s a small sample of Abdul Qadir’s genius. His googly, in particular, was a thing of beauty. Man, this is awful news.68th over: England 180-4 (Roy 12, Stokes 0) Awful news from Pakistan: Abdul Qadir, the legspin genius of the 1980s, has died at the age of 63. That’s shocking news.67th over: England 175-4 (Roy 7, Stokes 0) Roy got off the mark in style earlier in the over, driving Hazlewood sweetly to the extra-cover boundary. Incidentally, there was a typo in the 63rd over - I should have said that it’s only the second time Root has faced at least 150 balls in consecutive Test innings.We’ve seen that dismissal before with Root against Australia, trapped LBW as he falls over towards the off side. The ball nipped back and maybe kept a bit low. Root was so plumb that he barely even considered a review.Root has been pinned LBW by Hazlewood!66th over: England 167-3 (Root 70, Roy 0) Roy gropes hopefully at his first ball from Lyon, inside-edging it back onto the body. He shapes to hammer the last delivery of the over through the off side, sees it start to turn big and aborts the shot. Lyon looks at him with contempt. “Fine,” says Sumit Rahman. “Broad as captain, but Buttler in charge of reviews. Now everyone has a role.”And a specialist DRS coach in the dressing-room.65th over: England 166-3 (Root 69, Roy 0) Jason Roy inside-edges his first ball back onto the pad. He is under so much pressure, having made 19 runs his last four innings. His joyous evisceration of the Aussies in the World Cup semi-final must feel a long time ago.Rory Burns’ fine innings is over. He edged a good delivery from Hazlewood towards second slip, where the inevitable Steve Smith took a sharp tumbling catch. It was a really good piece of bowling from Hazlewood - a perfect length, and with just enough movement off the seam to take the edge.A big wicket for Australia!64th over: England 166-2 (Burns 81, Root 69) Burns flat-bats Lyon this far short of Wade, swooping forward at cover. At first I thought it was a dropped chance, but replays suggest it bounced a fraction in front of Wade.“I wonder,” says Geoff Wignall, “was 67 all out the salvation of this England side?”I’m not sure they are good enough to make it a salvation, but there has been a notable change of approach.63rd over: England 165-2 (Burns 80, Root 69) Cummins is replaced by Hazlewood, who bowls a maiden to Root. He has 69 from 161 balls. This is only the second time in Root’s Test career that he has faced at least 150 balls in consecutive Test innings, a reflection of his increased resolve. Runs are not coming easily, which in many ways makes his performance even more impressive.62nd over: England 165-2 (Burns 80, Root 69) A top-edged sweep from Burns teases fine leg before dropping well short. England take a single, the first of four from the over. They need another 133 runs to avoid the follow-on.“Can we stop with the captaincy hot takes?” says David Hart. “Root is still our best bat, he’s a decent leader, respected by the players, and his overall record is good (we drubbed India last year - Kohli still seems to be hanging on). People who want to humiliate him by making Eoin Morgan - a guy who barely plays red ball cricket - captain are eating the sky-iest pie ever. It’s not Root’s fault England can’t find two openers, Anderson gled himself and Buttler seems to have lost his bottle, any more than Tim Paine is a great leader ifwhen Smith wins them the series. ROOOO-OOOOT.”You’re not looking at the whole pie.61st over: England 161-2 (Burns 78, Root 67) Cummins continues this is his 10th over in this spell. The man’s an animal. Burns defends most of the over before turning a single off the pads. England may have seen Cummins off. “I’m sat in my office in Manchester looking out over a very grey sky over Old Trafford in a funk after a few days in Paris eating my body weight in patisserie and cheese washed down with heavenly red wine,” says Guy Hornsby. “The comedown is real, almost as difficult as being in the field yesterday when a week earlier it was The Headingley Experience. It would SO English to give us that miracle then fritter away the Ashes in the next 24 hours. Surely an incentive in itself for stubbornness?”60th over: England 160-2 (Burns 77, Root 67) A maiden from Lyon to Root. Thanks for all your pitch suggestions, which I’ve forwarded to Sam.59th over: England 160-2 (Burns 77, Root 67) Root is beaten again by the luckless Cummins, who follows up with a big inducker that Root gets a bat on at the last minute. Cummins’ figures in this spell are 9-2-21-0.57th over: England 158-2 (Burns 77, Root 65) Burns survives a run-out chance after taking a dodgy single off Cummins. He would have been well short had Head’s throw hit the stumps. Burns then fences another nasty lifter in the air on the off side, but it falls short of Lyon. Cummins doesn’t deserve a wicket in this spell he deserves two or three.56th over: England 154-2 (Burns 74, Root 64) “I like a bowler as captain,” says Sam Collier, “but do we really want Broad in charge of DRS?”Now that’s what I call a fair point.55th over: England 151-2 (Burns 73, Root 62) Root continues, and Cummins continues to rough him up. The first ball after the break thuds into the glove, with Root taking his eye off the ball. This is blistering Test cricket.“The way things are going,” says Bobby Dunnett, “Jason Roy could still be facing the new ball early in his innings.”“Dear Rob,” says Sam Wrighton. “Our final league game of the year is tomorrow. We’re (Hackney CC) 2nd, playing 1st (London Fields CC). Winner takes the league. We’ve just got an email from the council saying some Travellers are on the pitch and our game is in danger of being cancelled. Anyone know of a pitch we can use in London please?!”If anyone can help, please get in touch and I’ll forward it on to Sam.54.4 overs: England 151-2 (Burns 73, Root 62) Root edges Cummins wide of second slip for four. I think it would have dropped short but it was another sharp delivery from Cummins, who has bowled gloriously either side of tea. The harder the yakka, the higher he rolls his sleeves. He’s a captain’s dream.There’s a break in play while Root receives treatment, having been hit on the knee by Cummins. He’s in a fair bit of pain.Root is not out! Bumble knows. It was a fine delivery from Cummins, which turned Root round and rammed into the back pad as he pushed down the wrong line. It does look too high – and it also hit him outside the line. Australia lose a review.Root survives a huge LBW shout - but Australia review! Bumble reckons it’s too high I reckon it’s very close.54th over: England 147-2 (Burns 73, Root 58) Burns dumps a slog-sweep to the midwicket boundary to move into the seventies. There has been so much to admire in this partnership, even though they have both had moments of fortune. Burns’ shot selection has been almost immaculate. 53rd over: England 143-2 (Burns 69, Root 58) A big let-off for Root! Cummins found the edge with a gorgeous outswinger that Root tried to flick to leg, and the ball went straight between Warner at first slip and Paine for four. They both left it to each other. This is a sensational old-ball spell from Cummins.“Captaincy,” says Kristian Petterson. “I know it’s almost heresy but might it be worth considering a - whisper it - bowler?”Yes, I think Broad for a couple of years isn’t a terrible idea, but there would be issues with rotation. I haven’t a clue. Sod it, give it to Rob Key."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5950a70cbac557557e65d393b3d1acb506922465/137_233_4867_2920/master/4867.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=722bce963c796e6267826b21927cf776","title":"us open mens semi final daniil medvedev v grigor dimitrov live","story":"Hello and welcome to our coverage of the first men’s semi-final betweenThe question at the start of the tournament was how to solve a problem like breaking the hegemony of the Big Three. Now we have two-thirds of the answer: wait for Djokovic to be cut down by a shoulder injury in the last 16 and then let the man formerly known as Baby Federer take out the actual and ailing Federer over five sets in the quarter-finals. Of course Rafael Nadal is still standing, and is looking in ominous form before his semi-final later against the brave or perhaps foolhardy Matteo Berrettini, but Medvedev or Dimitrov will have to leave that last part of the problem until another day. First they must face off for a place in their debut grand slam final.For the 23-year-old Medvedev, this is his first major semi-final for the 28-year-old Dimitrov, this is his third in a career that hasn’t lived up to its tremendous promise. While Medvedev arrived in New York as the man of the hardcourt summer, having defeated Djokovic en route to the Cincinnati title and reached the Washington and Montreal finals, Dimitrov was the forgotten man. The former world No 3 entered this tournament down at 78th after an awful, injury-affected season in which he had lost seven of his past eight matches, including to the world No 405 six weeks ago. But Dimitrov’s victory over Federer from two sets to one down was a comeback in more ways than one. Rarely have there been such remarkable turnarounds in form.Despite taking out Federer, Dimitrov will have the crowd on his side against Medvedev, whose summer of success has not exactly turned into one of love. The quirky and controversial Russian, carrying an ever-increasing number of injuries after his exertions of late, has defiantly moved through the draw amid a chorus of boos, which started in the third round when he snatched a towel from a ballboy, gave spectators the middle finger and then trolled them in his on-court interview.The jeers and sarcastic retorts have continued since. But after Medvedev’s superb six weeks, during which he has risen to fourth in the rankings behind Djokovic, Nadal and Federer – or “the No 1 among mere mortals” as my colleague Tumaini Carayol writes – it would be a shame if he didn’t let his tennis do the talking in the biggest match of his life.The players will be on court at: 4pm New York time9pm BST."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82d380282f0d67fe91a5ede47021ed34663a6016/608_496_3093_1857/master/3093.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc296f15475ed0248b68ed6a7524a138","title":"anahera review finborough theatre london maori social worker new zealand emma kinane","story":"Finborough, LondonAfter a boy runs away, a Maori social worker is sent to investigate the parents in Emma Kinane’s engaging if overlong New Zealand dramaA young Maori social worker is sent to a family whose 11-year-old son has run away. Trying to determine what has gone wrong, she asks the mother, Liz, to describe her parenting style. “Tactical warfare,” is the jokey reply, which turns out to have a dark truth to it.Anahera (Acushla-Tara Kupe), the social worker, is the dramatic interloper who exposes the family dysfunction in Emma Kinane’s play. She refuses to leave this middle-class, New Zealand home after order has seemingly been restored, troubled by the rules and punishments set out by the parents for their two children.Her unwelcome presence prizes open a Pandora’s box of revelations. Parallel storytelling between two time frames 20 years apart sets up the central mystery: is Anahera unfairly judging parents who are simply trying to do their best? Or is something sinister going on? The drama leads us towards the latter too quickly. Some temporal leaps also seem unnecessary and the play takes on greater depth of feeling when a time period is sustained for longer.But the play teases out issues of class and race with delicious satire and deftness. Liz (Caroline Faber) and Peter (Rupert Wickham) see themselves above other “feral” parents in need of social-work intervention. “Look around, we’re decent,” says Peter, while Liz reveals her casual racism towards Anahera’s Maori origins.Taboo-breaking questions are asked of motherhood, too. Liz is an increasingly frightening figure, rivetingly played by Faber. But she retains an edge of the diabolic even if the script tries to circumvent the caricature of the monster mother and humanise her side of the story.Other thorny issues are broached, from their children’s struggles with forgiveness as adults to their fear of inheriting their mother’s abusive mindset, and Kinane tacitly asks how much control we have to break this inherited cycle.There is much to be admired in this play, from its intensity to its tension-building. But at over two hours long, the family reckoning becomes gruelling to watch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adb358aea9f8fd7481f5791aea77ad4a330a0c6b/0_132_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a6ffe59aaf6c22ad9096bdfc75331e0","title":"share cultural highlights of japan for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Tell us about your best experiences, from visiting ancient temples to manga comic stores in Tokyo or Osaka … anywhere you’ve enjoyed Japanese culture old or newYou may have walked a pilgrimage trail, attended sumo wrestling or bathed in a hot spring.

Half of Americans under 40 say they would prefer to live in a socialist countryIn his 1998 film, Bulworth, Warren Beatty played a Democratic senator who goes rogue, embarking on a truth-telling binge in which he spouts radical truths no Democrat serious about election would ever utter. At one stage, Bulworth even mentions socialism.“In America that’s like saying cocksucker,” Beatty once told me with a chuckle over dinner at his home in Los Angeles shortly before the film came out in Britain a year later. “We have this so-called thriving economy which has missed most people and while the disparity between rich and poor increases we have just one party – the money party, made up of Republicans and Democrats.”When I suggested to him he sounded like a socialist he swatted the term away.“I’m interested in a government that looks out for people who need to be looked out for,” Beatty said. “Ideology seems to be so unfashionable, so why not take advantage of it and not name oneself with a term that has become particularly problematic?”But quite what people mean by “socialist” is an open question.“The way I translated it to people was: you shouldn’t have to choose between paying for prescription and paying for groceries,” explains Sarah Innamorata, the socialist Pennsylvania state representative I met in Pittsburgh, who defeated a five-term incumbent who had been elected unopposed the last three times. “If you work for 40 hours a week you deserve to be able to support yourself and your family. And when you go outside you should be able to breathe clean air and turn on the faucets and get clean water. And really none of that is going to change unless we change who represents us and we change the way our government works.”To some extent, the views on socialism say as much about how people are feeling about capitalism. This is not a new trend. When President Barack Obama was planning his run for a second term his pollsters noticed that the time-honored rhetorical appeals to a life of relentless progress and upward mobility weren’t really working.“The language around the American dream wasn’t carrying the same resonance,” Joel Benenson, one of Obama’s key pollsters, told the Washington Post. “Some of the symbols of achieving the American dream were becoming burdens: owning that house with the big mortgage was expensive, owning two cars and more debts, having your kid go to college. The cost and burden of taking out those loans was making a lot of Americans ambivalent. They weren’t sure a college education was worth it.”Over the last 40 years wages have stagnated in real terms while the price of college has risen eight times as fast and the price of health insurance has also outpaced earnings.At a local level it is also a response to a sclerotic democracy riddled with entitlement, nepotism and corruption. In south-west Pennsylvania, Innamorata beat Dom Costa. His extended family had dominated local politics for several years. One of his cousins, Paul, was defeated in his race for state representative by another socialist candidate, Summer Lee, an African American woman. The previous year another of Dom’s cousins, Ronald Costa, was beaten by Mikhail Pappas, another socialist candidate, for district judge.In Chicago, where six socialist-backed candidates won seats to the 50-seat city council earlier this year, the same pattern of taking down a corrupt establishment was clear.The city’s 33rd ward had been in alderwoman Deborah Mell’s family for the past 44 years. Her father Dick Mell, the father-in-law of the former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich (currently in jail for corruption and extortion), had held the seat since 1975. When Dick retired in 2013, Mayor Rahm Emmanuel appointed his daughter as his successor. She lost the seat to a socialist candidate, Rosana Rodriguez-Sanchez. Another socialist, Andre Vasquez, beat Patrick O’Connor, who has been on the city council for 36 years and was part of the overwhelmingly white council group that fought hard to block the agenda of the Chicago’s first African American mayor, Harold Washington. All three of the aldermen who preceded Jeanette Taylor, also backed by the Democratic Socialists of America, were indicted for fraud.It is potentially, in these local spaces that the shift to the left and the shift to the grassroots might meet. At the first ward meeting for Rodriguez-Sanchez, more than 60 people crowded into a small room, where their new representative said a few words before encouraging people to approach her or her staff with issues they would like raised. Rodriguez-Sanchez beat Deborah Mell by just 13 votes. Every last piece of organisation helped.The Democratic Socialists played a role, explains local activist Sandy Gutstein, but so did lots of groups, including immigrants’ rights organizations and anti-racist campaigners. “A lot of people were coming into the office who have not been involved in politics before,” she said. “I think people were attracted to the campaign because of that.”Across town, that same night, Jeanette Taylor had to choose a ward superintendent, a paid position to monitor whether local people are getting the services to which they are entitled. Usually they are appointed. Taylor held an election. “I let the community decide,” she said. “Anything that’s going to get built in this community, it will be up for the community to decide whether it gets built or not. Three people applied. We heard a presentation from all three folks. They were asked to leave. We had some discussion and then they voted.”According to Gallup, Americans are more likely to associate socialism with “equality” than “government ownership or control”, as they did in the 40s. “I don’t think it’s about class antagonism,” explains Jesse Sharkey, the leader of the Chicago Teachers’ Union. “It’s about humane capitalism – having social control over the harshest features of capitalism like healthcare and pensions.”The point is it’s a question that is now regularly put in polls and a label that is popularly claimed. It remains problematic for many.But it’s no longer like saying cocksucker.Carlos Ramirez-Rosa has been an alderman in Chicago since 2015. When he ran four years ago he “flirted with the idea of running as an open democratic socialist” but decided against it. “There were a number of people in the community who wanted to see me run but said ‘Carlos, don’t run with this group of socialists’. Because you’re going to go out there and wave this red flag and these folks who are pushing you to do that are going to stay on the sidelines.”Ramirez-Rosa credits the shift to Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist candidate who mounted a surprisingly effective challenge against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination in 2016 and is running again. “Seeing him so openly talking about being a democratic socialist. Not running away from the label leaning in to it.” Earlier this year he ran as a democratic socialist and won again.“Having been involved in the work I’m not surprised at all that we have six socialists on city council. But when I take a step back and put myself in the place I was in 2015 I think, ‘Wow, that’s tremendous.’”Rick Perlstein, a Chicago-based author who has chronicled the rise of the American right since the civil rights era, believes some of socialism’s appeal comes from Republicans using it as an epithet against Barack Obama in the midst of an economic crisis. “I think a lot of people felt, well if that’s what socialism is then how bad can it be?”I met Perlstein at a packed Martyrs’ nightclub in Chicago where the young dance while older folk clap and stomp as Daniel Kahn and the Painted Bird sing about gentrification, toxic masculinity and economic inequality. Flitting between Yiddish and English Kahn draws on pre-second world war leftwing Jewish traditions, adapting songs written by socialist Bundist leaders of yore.The event, organised by Chicago Yivo, which aims to promote the cultural history of Jewish life in eastern Europe, Germany and Russia in the city. “It’s an alternative to a Zionist identity,” says Kate Underhill who organized the event. “It’s not a total rejection of it but it tries to move beyond the two pillars of Jewish identity – Zionism and the Holocaust – by embracing left Jewish culture pre-world war two.”Shtumer Alef, the yiddish punk support band for Kahn, warmed the crowd up by getting them to sing along in Yiddish to: “Remember to always punch Nazis.”“Trump has politicised everything,” says Lorrie, who sings in the band, as she pops out for a cigarette. “People talk about politics all the time. But the Democratic establishment keeps failing upwards. That’s why they are so scared of someone like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez . She’s a powerful symbol of a different way of doing things.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a099a76eb22b44f419b0346fdf6b8eaa32ab28c7/0_172_5150_3090/master/5150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e16f5a22c6cde2a848db7f592ffc0e9b","title":"clergy hardship church of england wealth","story":"Exclusive: Some vicars are tens of thousands of pounds in debt and reliant on charity handoutsHundreds of clergy are in financial hardship, with some resorting to credit cards or even a high-interest payday lender, despite the Church of England sitting on a multibillion-pound investment fund.Some vicars are tens of thousands of pounds in debt, with many struggling to survive – especially those supporting families – and relying on charity handouts to make ends meet, the  has learned.Clergy Support Trust’s chief executive, Jeremy Moodey, told the  that in at least one recent case, a vicar had been forced to use a high-interest payday lender. He also highlighted how some clergy had been hit by the government’s controversial introduction of a two-child limit on benefits, which restricted the child allowance in universal credit and tax credits.It comes amid dwindling congregation numbers and raises questions over whether the C of E should be doing more to help impoverished vicars given that it has an investment fund worth £8.3bn and is paying asset management executives six-figure sums, including one who earned more than £530,000 last year. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby – who has two grace-and-favour homes including Lambeth Palace – is paid £83,400 and last year attacked Amazon for not paying a living wage and railed against poverty.The bishop of Buckingham, the Right Rev Alan Wilson, told the  “there’s always more to be done” to help financially struggling clergy. “Clergy people’s circumstances and the stresses of ministry are becoming more complex and erse all the time,” he said. “Often people are kind and there is help out there, but there are holes in what’s available.”Moodey, a former banker who is training part-time to become a vicar, said he was shocked by the levels of financial hardship among some clergy when he took on the trust role.“Clergy are not going to be serving their communities as well as they might if they’re worrying about paying bills or getting a holiday,” he said. “They live in a goldfish bowl in the vicarage. They need to get away but often they can’t afford it if they have got families.”He said they often struggled to cover everyday costs, such as fixing a broken washing machine or paying for new school uniforms. Many clergy had an “innate tendency not to come forward for help”, Moodey added, also expressing concern for those who suffered relationship breakdown.“There’s a sense of: ‘There are many in my congregation who are worse off than me. Why should I regard myself as a special case?’”In the case of the vicar who was forced to use a payday loan firm, Moodey said: “He is now working through a debt repayment plan with a debt advice charity which is a partner of ours, with some help from us to get that sorted.”Welby has previously attacked payday lenders, but his criticism backfired when it emerged the C of E held an indirect investment in the now defunct Wonga. Moodey said: “Payday lenders are causing significant suffering amongst the wider population and you would hope that clergy would be able to mirror what is the church’s position which is that, actually, payday lenders are bad news. But if you’re desperate and you really can’t make ends meet, then desperate people do desperate things.”Most vicars receive a stipend of up to £27,886 plus housing but there are nearly 3,000 “self-supporting” ministers who are not paid, according to newly released C of E figures. The C of E’s website lists a series of adverts for “house for duty” roles, which are unpaid.Wilson said: “Mental health issues pose an increasing challenge, and I worry about retired non-stipendiary clergy and some clergy spouses who are in real difficulties. There is always more to be done, not only for iniduals who are struggling, but in order to understand the underlying trends. Above all, it’s important that people experiencing problems alert archdeacons and bishops to what is going on.”A C of E spokeswoman said: “We take the wellbeing of our 20,000 clergy extremely seriously. We note with concern the cases highlighted by Clergy Support Trust and we are grateful for its support for clergy struggling financially, as well as for the work of the Churches’ Mutual Credit Union, launched in 2015 with the backing of the Church of England.“Problem debt is a widespread and serious issue in our society and it is worrying that a group of clergy is also affected.”The C of E said it was “hugely appreciative” of self-supporting ministers “who work voluntarily for the church, many already with successful careers in the secular world”.The archbishop of Canterbury’s stipend is set independently and Lambeth Palace also houses offices for staff and space for other groups, and welcomes visitors, the C of E added.He is a familiar face on TV screens, fronting BBC documentaries exploring religious issues.But while many viewers will recognise the Rev Peter Owen-Jones, most will have no idea that he would not be able to continue in priesthood without charitable handouts.The 61-year-old is a non-stipendiary vicar – serving the villages of Firle, Glynde and Beddingham in East Sussex – meaning he is not paid by the Church of England for his duties.Instead, Owen-Jones is reliant on a yearly charitable grant of up to £3,000 and an “honorarium” from the diocese of £430 every quarter. “I would not be able to continue as priest were it not for the support of the Clergy Support Trust,” he said.“I get a grant from them and I’ve had a grant from them for the last three or four years. This is my choice. I love being a parish priest. I’ve taken the moral decision to be a non-stipendiary priest because I think that just sits easier with me. I don’t have an issue with priests not being paid. I have an issue with that system subsidising what appears to be an unchanged and an unchanging centre.”Last month, the former advertising executive revealed that in his early days as a vicar supporting a young family, he had once been so broke he made money posing naked for an art class.In theory, Owen-Jones’s unpaid role – which comes with a house in Firle – is part-time, but the reality is different and he questions the C of E’s approach, describing its reliance on self-supporting ministers as “morally questionable” given that they are often expected to perform full-time duties.Owen-Jones, who is orced and has four adult children, said: “When I tell people I’m not paid they say: ‘What?’ This has been coming for 30 or 40 years. The more and more non-stipendiary priests, the greater the clamour will become.“I think there is an increasing reliance on non-stipendiary vicars. How much of the church is being kept afloat by self-supporting ministry? Whether those ministers can continue to be treated as full-time ministers, that to me is morally questionable.”In 2002 there were 2,091 self-supporting ministers, but that has now risen to 2,920 following a slight decline in recent years. Self-supporting ministers tend to be older, with an average age of 62.3 compared with 52.1 for stipend posts. Nearly a third (190) of vicars in training last year were preparing for non-stipendiary roles.Owen-Jones, who was a stipendiary priest earlier in his career, added: “What’s happening is that the church is increasingly relying on what they call ‘self-supporting’ ministers and ‘house-for-duty’ priests.“At the moment I believe it’s been happening under the counter. We need to have a frank and open discussion about whether the church can afford to maintain its working apparatus or whether there needs to be root-and-branch reform, given the number of people that are going to church and given the expectations that are placed upon the church by the state. At the moment it’s not adding up.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97b53ef1148c3de7a7c5be923515d5dd8c73513b/0_168_5049_3029/master/5049.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4e1021872febbdf90e24940f2cf82ed","title":"hurricane dorian bahamas grand bahama abaco latest news","story":"Five days after Hurricane Dorian struck Grand Bahama and the Abaco islands, causing enormous destruction and leaving at least 30 dead and hundreds missing, Erica Roberts told the  how she survived the nightmare.As Grand Bahama was lashed with 185mph winds, she clung to a tall mango tree, she said, wind and sea water pounding her face.A single thought ran through her head: “I will not die like this.”On Friday, emergency crews were searching for survivors and the missing. International aid efforts gained momentum as thousands waited for help. The death toll was sure to rise.Roberts’ home, in the small town of High Rock on the eastern side of the island, had been swept away. Her 24-year-old daughter Natori survived too, clinging to branches beside her.Roberts’ face and arms still bore dry, bloody cuts. The pair eventually lost their grip, she said, but they were swept close to a home that still stood. They got inside.“By the grace of God, we made it,” she said. “We are survivors.”The 41-year-old had not heard from seven close family members: two sons, a sister, two nephews, cousins, uncles. All were still missing. In a community of about 600, two were confirmed dead. At least 20 had not been heard from since Dorian spent two days destroying almost every building in sight.“We need aid,” Roberts said. “We have nothing. Everyone is doing this self-sufficiently.”Parts of the road in had been stripped of tarmac, leaving rubble, exposed pipework and pools of bronzed water where trapped fish still swam. Broken pylons dangled in the street. Palms were bent at 45 degrees, leaves shaved off by the wind.The storm surge here, about half a mile from the sea, rose to around 20ft. Wind gusts were recorded at 220mph. Many who have lived here for generations said the brutality of the storm was something they had never seen or even heard of before.For Roberts, who works at a nearby casino – also obliterated – the unprecedented intensity of Dorian, the way it intensified so quickly to category 5 and stood over the island for over 24 hours, had a simple explanation.“I think the climate is playing a big role in all of this,” she said, starring at the muddy tiled floor of a partially destroyed home in which she had taken shelter. “The severity of this … it’s global warming.“I’ve recycled all my life. I use less plastic. And think about less emissions. I’ve always been committed. But the world is not.”As residents of High Rock began to assess the damage, the global climate crisis was on the minds of many.Euridice Kemp, a 40-year-old resident of Freeport, had returned to help salvage what she could from her grandparents’ home. All that was left of the building were the concrete foundations. Belongings – crockery, family photos, clothes, wooden furniture – were strewn on the muddy grass. She pointed to the horizon where six coconut trees once stood, where she played as a child.“It’s all gone. What we’re doing to mother earth and the way this turns around on areas like here … I just can’t. Never … never in my life. My heart is broken. I’m in shock.”Did she consider herself a victim of the climate crisis?“We are the biggest victims of climate change. But how can we fight for ourselves against bigger, global countries? How do we move forward?”At the shoreline, the sea still churned. A lighthouse was partially destroyed, its light blown away, leaving only a red-and-white striped tower.Pastor Joey Saunders, 61, was counting his blessings. The storm surge crept up to the roof of his house. He spent two days clinging to the branches of a tree, waiting for the water to recede, terrified sharks might lurk below. The wind lashed him so hard, he began to feel numb.“I couldn’t feel anything any more,” he said. “I was just so afraid.”Aid had just begun to reach remote parts of the island. Bahamian officials warned of delays because of flooding.At the port on Grand Abaco, the Royal Bahamas Defense Force (RBDF) helped people board a ferry that had come to pick up employees and had room for an additional 160. The crowd waited calmly as marines separated women and children to board first.A British navy ship was sending in aid on a landing craft, including blankets and 500 boxes of ration packs to feed families of four. Senior Lt William Sturrup of the RBDF said the ship would return, and a 210ft landing craft from his force would come with supplies and trucks. Two yachts had brought in aid, including pallets of water bottles.The UN announced the purchase of eight tons of ready-to-eat meals and said it would provide satellite communications and airlift storage units, generators and prefab offices. UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock said about 70,000 people were “in immediate need of life-saving assistance”.On Grand Bahama, a Royal Caribbean cruise ship dropped off 10,000 meals, 10,000 bottles of water and more than 180 generators, as well as diapers and flashlights. American Airlines said it flew a Boeing 737 to Nassau with 14,000lbs of supplies. The Netherlands said it would send ships from the territory of Sint Maarten."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfe3f98ba5a47451672c5a05c7ba90df38685951/0_281_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2d6ba175a0e5df321417b82ef93cd41","title":"indian woman 73 gives birth twin girls mangayamma yaramati andhra pradesh","story":"Mangayamma Yaramati and babies in good health, say doctors in Andhra PradeshA 73-year-old woman in southern India who has given birth to healthy twin girls described motherhood as “the happiest time of my life”.The babies were delivered through caesarean section on Thursday. Uma Shankar, the woman’s doctor, told the  the mother and her children were in good health. Mangayamma Yaramati and her husband, Sitarama Rajarao, 82, from Andhra Pradesh, said they had always wanted to become parents but were unable to conceive. Yaramati told BBC Telugu they had been stigmatised in their community because they were childless.“They would call me a childless lady,” she said, adding: “We tried many times and saw numerous doctors, so this is the happiest time of my life.” Yaramati had a baby shower this week, before the delivery.Shankar said his patient was cared for “in the scientific way”. “During the treatment we had three groups of doctors: one took care of her general health, one took care of her nutritional status and one to took care of her pregnancy.” These three areas were monitored every day, he added.Manngayamma started the menopause 25 years ago, and so an egg was taken from a donor and fertilised with Rajarao’s sperm through IVF, Shankar told the Hindustan Times. “Luckily, she conceived in the first cycle and was found to be pregnant in January.”|Shankar said many of the women who came for IVF had had children but they were killed in road accidents. “They come for IVF at a later age. We have many women from the 40-50 age group.” The social disapproval associated with not having children was a problem, he added.Manngayamma may be the oldest woman to conceive. Shankar said according to her patient’s birth certificate, she was born in 1946.In 2016, another Indian woman, Daljinder Kaur, who was thought to have been 72 when she gave birth to a boy.Asked how they would care for their children, Rajarao said: “Nothing is in our hands.

But when Ninis Rosqvist and her team took this year’s measurements, at the end of the summer melt on 3 September, the northern peak was 1.2 metres higher at 2,096.8 metres.“We suspected this was probably the case last year,” Ninis Rosqvist told the  from the Tarfala research station at the foot of the massif. “But unfortunately our measurements were not precise enough. Now we can say with certainty: we are accurate to within a couple of centimetres.”The scientist said the height of Kebnekaise’s southern peak was the lowest on record: 24 metres less than in the 1960s. “Almost all the shrinkage has been in past two decades, when the glacier has lost an average of one metre a year,” she said.Since the glacier was likely to expand again with winter snow and ice, the southern peak could briefly recover its ranking, Ninis Rosqvist said. “It will keep changing for a while,” she said. “But the trend is now firmly established, and very clear.”Sweden recorded its hottest ever months of May and July in 2018, with temperatures soaring to more than 10C above normal. With wildfires burning across the Arctic, the Kebnekaise glacier shrank by almost four metres.Although this July was not as hot after an unusually cool start to the month, the village of Markusvinsa in the far north of the country recorded 34.8C on 26 July – the highest temperature ever recorded north of the Arctic circle in Sweden.Ninis Rosqvist said small glaciers such as that on Kebnekaise’s southern peak were particularly badly affected by warm summers. It was mainly cool summers that allowed glaciers to grow, rather than particularly harsh winters, she said. But the past two Scandinavian summers had caused the snow and ice to melt away very fast. “You can see it at the top, where it’s most exposed to the sun. It really looks different. It gets slippery up there you can see the meltwater running off.”The news may have been expected, but the official downgrading of the southern peak was still “emotionally quite something”, Ninis Rosqvist said. “The mountains are changing so fast – higher temperatures, less snow, winter rain.”The glacier on Kebnekaise’s southern peak was “iconic – a symbol for all the glaciers in Sweden”, she said, adding: “But you know, we don’t need any more symbols. We don’t need to pile up more evidence. We can see the climate changing before our eyes up here, and we need to do something about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc60264ac7152009e06a580c29dc04820cc41c24/0_83_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dffe45023566356fccbdfe5e4dc87c8d","title":"hurricane dorian latest bahamas carolinas live updates","story":"Eighteen members of Florida’s Congressional delegation have called on President Trump to waive visa requirements for Bahamians seeking shelter after Hurricane Dorian.The delegation joins the state’s two senators, Republicans Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, who on Wednesday wrote a similar letter to Trump highlighting the need for “shelter and reunification with family in the United States”. Approximately 20,000 Bahamians live in South Florida. Florida is threatened by storms each and every year, and Floridians have close ties to the Bahamas. Now, lawmakers are reckoning with the help the people of the Abaco islands will need to recover.’s Oliver Laughland (@oliverlaughland) is on Grand Bahama Island today talking to survivors of the storm. He has been able to reach a remote part of the island via ship, here’s his latest dispatch: As Erica Roberts clung to a tall mango tree, the winds and sea water churned up by hurricane Dorian pounding her face, a single thought ran through her head: “I will not die like this”.Her home, in the small town of High Rock on the eastern side of Grand Bahama Island, had already been swept away. Her 24 year-old daughter Natori, was along side her clinging to branches as well. Her face and arms still bear the dry, bloody cuts of her hours exposed to the 185 mph winds. The pair eventually lost their grip but were swept close to a nearby home that had withstood the hurricane’s devastation. They got inside. “By the grace of God we made it,” she said. “We are survivors.” The 41-year-old has not yet heard from seven of her close family: two sons, a sister, two nephews, cousins, uncles. All still missing. In this community of around 600, two people have been confirmed dead but at least 20 have not been heard from since Dorian spent almost two days destroying almost every building in sight. “We need aid. We have nothing. Everyone is doing this self-sufficiently,” she said. Parts of the road in to High Rock have been stripped of tarmac, leaving piles of rubble, exposed pipework and pools of bronzed water where trapped fish still swim. Broken pylons dangle in the street. The palms are bent at 45 degrees, their leaves shaved off by the wind. Aid has only just begun to reach these more remote parts of the island. The storm surge here rose to around 20 feet. Wind gusts were recorded at 220 mph. Many who have lived in this area, about half a mile from the sea, for generations, said the brutality of the storm was something they have never seen or heard of before.For Roberts, who worked at a nearby casino – also obliterated – the unprecedented intensity of Dorian, the way it rapidly intensified to a category 5 and stood still over the island for over 24 hours, has an obvious explanation. “I think the climate is playing a big role in all of this,” she said, starring at the muddy tiled floor of a partially destroyed family home she had now taken shelter in. “The severity of this… it’s global warming.” “I’ve recycled all my life. I use less plastic. And think about less emissions. I’ve always been committed. But the world is not.” The Bahamian Health Ministry said helicopters and ships are on the way to Abaco and Grand Bahama , two islands which suffered the worst of the storm, to provide aid and transport. However, severe flooding is causing delays. At least 30 people have been killed by the hurricane, but officials expect it to rise. Survivors of Dorian are gathering at a port in Abaco, hoping aid and transportation off the island is coming their way. A new dispatch from the Associated Press paints the scene: Carrying their meager possessions in duffel bags and shopping carts, hundreds of desperate storm victims gathered at the port in Grand Abaco on Friday in hopes of getting off the hurricane-devastated island, amid signs of rising frustration over the pace of the disaster-relief effort. ‘It’s chaos here,’ said Gee Rolle, a 44-year-old construction worker who waited with his wife for a boat that could take them to the capital, Nassau. ‘The government is trying their best, but at the same time, I don’t think they’re doing a good enough job to evacuate the people. It ain’t livable for nobody. Only animals can live here.’At the port, some of those who lined up behind a yellow cloth tape arrived as early as 1 a.m., hoping to get to Nassau.‘It’s going to get crazy soon,’ said Serge Simon, 39, who drives an ice truck and waited with his wife and two sons, 5 months old and 4. ‘There’s no food, no water. There are bodies in the water. People are going to start getting sick.’In its most recent update, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said a Weatherflow station in North Carolina’s Outer Banks reported wind gusts of 98 mph and sustained winds of 83mph. The storm was about 50 miles off the coast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, where the eye of the hurricane hit earlier today. It was roughly 460 miles off the southwest coast of Nantucket in Massachusetts. Dorian is projected to move further away from the US coast today, moving toward Canada. The NHC said its moving toward the northeast at 17mph, and is expected to increase in speed through Saturday. “Hurricane Dorian makes Bahamians the latest climate crisis victims,” tweets Climate Reality, the advocacy group founded by Al “An Inconvenient Truth” Gore, former Veep and early environment and climate activist.The tweet echoes the headline of and links to an opinion piece in the New York Times. It’s not certain whether Dorian will still be whirling with hurricane force when it continues its track over the next 24 hours or so and arrives in Canada.But one keen weather watcher reckons it will.Winds still at 90mph this hour.Ann Warner stayed on her home on Ocracoke Island, in the Outer Banks, a string of islands off the coast of North Carolina, as Dorian made landfall there this morning, the ’s Adam Gabbatt writes.“Within 10 minutes it went from nothing to catastrophic flooding. We were prepared but not for this amount of water,” she told the .“We have been through many hurricanes. This one just came fast with the storm surge.”Warner, who owns Howard’s Pub on Ocracoke, rode out the storm with her son, Blackburn, and his dog, Rocky. She posted a series of videos to her Facebook page showing water swirling around the base of her house – it would eventually enter her first floor.“We are safe,” she told the . “However Ocracoke Island had significant storm surge - the most we have experienced before.”Warner said water had also made it into “many” homes that “have never had storm surge” before.“The wind is still strong and water, while going down, is still extremely high,” she said at 11am.The Outer Banks was under an evacuation order but many locals consider that more a message for tourists than those who’ve lived and ridden out storms here for years.Warner said the water was higher than during Hurricane Matthew, a category 5 hurricane that devastated Haiti and had a dramatic impact on the south-eastern US in 2007.The links between the Carolinas, powerful hurricanes and the climate crisis were explored earlier this summer in a  article.Here’s a tweet from the National Weather Service’s NewportMorehead arm on the North Carolina coast.Bahamian health minister Duane Sands has warned of the probability of a very high death toll in Abaco and Grand Bahama as the catastrophe continues to unfold.He told people to brace for a “staggering” final count, when speaking to local radio late Thursday.“The public needs to prepare for unimaginable information about the death toll and the human suffering,” he said.The International Red Cross has estimated that almost half of homes on Grand Bahama have been wrecked, amid huge areas of flooding.There are fears of looting by survivors, now that the 200mph+ winds and the cascading rainfall and crashing seas have abated.Grand Abaco is said to be virtually uninhabitable.The official death toll is still 30, but is expected to climb steeply as services reach the most stricken areas.Emergency officials are fanned out across stricken areas of the northern reaches of the Bahamas to track down people who are still missing or in distress.Crews have begun clearing streets and setting up aid distribution centers.The United Nations has announced the purchase of eight tons of ready-to-eat meals, the Associated Press writes, and said it will provide satellite communications equipment and airlift storage units, generators and prefab offices to set up logistics hubs.UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock said about 70,000 people “are in immediate need of life-saving assistance” on Grand Bahama and Abaco.A British Royal Navy ship has docked at Abaco and distributed supplies to hurricane survivors.On Grand Bahama, a Royal Caribbean cruise ship dropped off 10,000 meals, 10,000 bottles of water and more than 180 generators, as well as diapers and flashlights.American Airlines said it flew a Boeing 737 from Miami to Nassau to drop off 14,000lbs of relief supplies. The airline is also giving frequent-flyer points to customers who donate at least $25 to the Red Cross.Troops from the Rhode Island National Guard will be heading to the Bahamas on Friday to help.Thousands of desperate people are still seeking help in Dorian’s aftermath. With winds of 185mph, the hurricane obliterated more than 13,000 houses on the Abaco and Grand Bahama islands.Crews in Grand Bahama worked to reopen the airport and used heavy equipment to pick up branches and palm fronds. Lines formed outside gas stations and grocery stores.“People will be out of jobs for months,” 67-year-old wood carver Gordon Higgs lamented. “They’ll be homeless, no food. Nothing.”Total property losses, not including infrastructure and autos, could reach $7bn, the firm Karen Clark \u0026amp Co estimated.On Thursday, medical officials moved hundreds of people left homeless by the storm out of the main hospital in Abaco to shelters in schools and other government buildings.At the Leonard M. Thompson airport, Rashad Reckley, a 30-year-old saxophonist, played the Bob Marley song Three Little Birds for people who had lost their homes.“I want to lift up everybody’s spirits after all the tragedy that happened,” said Reckley, who said he had exhausted his repertoire after playing for hours. “They want me to play more. But I can’t think of songs to play.”’s Adam Gabbatt spent last night in North Carolina, as the region was battered by the outer bands of the hurricane. It made landfall Friday morning at Cape Hatteras. He was in the area during the 2018 hurricane season, too.Wilmington, North Carolina, suffered more than most places at the hands of Hurricane Florence last year.The city is on the bank of the Cape Fear River, about 15 miles from the Atlantic Ocean, and as Florence dumped record-breaking rainfall Wilmington was cut off entirely from the rest of the mainland by floodwater, with no access in or out for days.Unsurprisingly, people here feared the worst as Dorian approached. On Thursday afternoon businesses along Wilmington’s main street were boarded up, and the streets deserted.Residents hunkered down inside as the storm trundled along the coast – some residents took refuge in a bar that had remained open despite Dorian’s impending arrival.On Friday morning, however, the worst fears proved to have been unfounded. There was a howling gale in Wilmington, but the rain had stopped and by 8.30am the sun was breaking through the clouds.I’m staying in an apartment building looking out onto the Cape Fear river. A US Coast Guard ship is moored right outside, and hasn’t moved since Thursday evening – a good sign.Even closer to the coast, residents of the popular tourist spots of Carolina Beach and Kure Beach were under mandatory evacuation orders on Thursday, but those areas also appeared to have missed the worst of the storm.Local television crews reported some minor damage to buildings, but as with Wilmington, the overriding emotion was one of relief.The three Republican musketeers of Florida, Senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott and governor Ron DeSantis, are heading to the disaster zone in the Bahamas to see how they can help.Interestingly, they are coming around to the idea these days that the human-spurred climate crisis is kinda very real and already affecting Florida, with much worse consequences to come (if dramatic action isn’t taken).Here’s a listicle from more than four years ago about Rubio’s climate change skepticism. If Florida had taken more action then......meanwhile, experts say global heating is increasing the intensity and frequency of monster hurricanes, which hit the Bahamas most fiercely this time, but a week ago had been feared to be heading close to Miami.Marco Rubio is evolving on climate change. Not a minute too soon.’s Oliver Laughland is now on Grand Bahama island and will file a dispatch later today. Here is the report, updated this morning, from Nassau, in conjunction with the ’s Adam Gabbatt, who spent the night in Wilmington, North Carolina, as Dorian howled in.Hurricane Dorian’s flood waters surpassed the floor boards, already five feet off the ground, so Freeport banana-farm owner Alpha Celestin, 61, busted a hole in his ceiling, propped a ladder there and climbed inside with two of his workers, the Miami Herald writes this morning, in a dispatch from Freeport, Grand Bahama.The venerable daily paper reports that the degree of destruction on the northern reaches of the Bahamas is “unimaginable”.The article continues that Celestin knew the other men couldn’t swim, so he tied Styrofoam from his ceiling around their chests to keep them afloat. They stayed perched there for 48 hours.“This is the first time I’ve ever come so close to death, like I was watching death in the eye,” he told the paper. “I never knew of such a hurricane.”“Everyone expected to pull a dead body from that house,” he said. “When I called they were very happy.”Read the full report here.A few meager possessions stuffed in plastic bags,some of the haggard Bahamians who lost homes to the ravages ofHurricane Dorian are waiting at a small airport hoping to catch planesout of the disaster zone as an international humanitarian effort tohelp the Caribbean country gains momentum and the official death toll has risento 30, the Associated Press writes.A few hundred people sat at the partl- flooded Leonard M. Thompsonairport on Abaco island later yesterday, as small planes picked up the mostvulnerable survivors, including the sick and the elderly. The evacuation was slow and there was frustration for some who said they had nowhere to go after the category 5 hurricane splintered whole neighborhoods.“They told us that the babies, the pregnant people and the elderlypeople were supposed to be first preference,” said Lukya Thompson, a23-year-old bartender. But many were still waiting, she said.Despite hardship and uncertainty, those at the airport were mostlycalm. The Bahamian health ministry said helicopters and boats were onthe way to help people in affected areas, though officials warned ofdelays because of severe flooding and limited access.At least 30 people died in the hurricane and the number could be“significantly higher,” Bahamian health minister Duane Sands told TheAssociated Press in a telephone interview late Thursday. The victims are from Abaco and Grand Bahama islands and include some who died from injuries after being flown to New Providence island, he said.The hurricane hit Abaco on Sunday and then hovered over Grand Bahamafor a day and a half.Hurricane Dorian’s coming ashore at Cape Hatteras this morning marks the first landfall since the storm reluctantly departed the Bahamian archipelago, after hitting the northern reaches of the Bahamas over the weekend.So after much trepidation all the way up the east coast of Florida, into Georgia and South Carolina (don’t mention Alabama), Dorian has made its initial and likely only US landfall on North Carolina’s Outer Banks barrier islands.Flooding is happening there now, with reports of inundation on the small island of Ocracoke. Ocracoke is towards the southern end of the wafer-thin barrier islands, offshore from where the Pamlico, Bay and Neuse rivers reach the ocean in North Carolina.Stand by for fuller reports about the Outer Banks and a dispatch from our man in Wilmington shortly, while we take the opportunity meanwhile to update you on the disastrous situation in parts of the Bahamas.Having just made landfall at Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, Dorian is spinning up the Atlantic Coast with winds up to 95mph.Cape Lookout reported one-minute sustained winds of 81 mph, with a gust of 94 mph early Friday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center.Tropical-storm-force wind, meaning it’s over 39mph, is now blowing up to 220 miles from the center of the storm. Hurricane-force winds mean speeds over 74mph and they are shrieking along up to 45 miles from the center.Good Morning, weather watchers. With Hurricane Dorian still upon us, we’ll continue to follow its progress and effects moment to moment today.We have correspondents on location in North Carolina and on Grand Bahama, as well as our team keeping vigil at  US HQ in New York, and we will bring you updates on the Atlantic coast and the Bahamas as they arise.Dorian is still a category 1 hurricane and is currently shrieking up the barrier islands off the north-eastern part of North Carolina."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Garda\u0026iacute seek information on Beige Nissan Almera in area of shooting in DonaghmedeKevin, Jackie Healy Rae and Malachy Scannell charged with series of assaults in 2017Leo Varadkar says economy will slow down but he rules out food or medicine shortagesCity\u0027s Georgian neighbourhood will become test bed for data collectionPM trying to act contrary to country\u0026rsquos constitutional position , Troubles campaigner allegesGroup calls decision to grant permission for project a setback in fight against childhood obesityStory characterised by enraged son as attempt to impugn reputation of dead fatherSport has taken off in a region which has a Celtic affinity to Ireland\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquobrother culture\u0026rsquoOverall, national suicide rates have dropped to their lowest level this centuryJudge hears club has reasonable prospect of survival if certain steps are takenAbout 60 people, including families with children, have been ordered to vacate Dublin city propertiesSiptu says members employed by GoSafe overwhelmingly back industrial actionDet Garda David Bourke (48), Oola, Co Limerick, charged with \u0026lsquocorruptly obtaining monetary gift\u0026rsquoFF leader questioned Government\u0026rsquos preparedness for worst possible Brexit outcomeThree Irish women killed when Air France flight crashed off Brazilian coast in 2009Dublin City Council agrees to accept statue following offer from Indian ambassadorAgreement reached between factory owners and protesters following alleged breach of injuctionsAustralian journalist claims to have drunk most expensive beer ever in Manchester"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4009253.1567748541!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ian paisley supplied money to uvf for bombings in 1969 documentary claims","story":"Clip from BBC series \u0027Spotlight On The Troubles: A Secret History\u0027 in which a young Martin McGuinness is filmed showing young boys a handgun and rifle from his car in Derry. The series reveals important new discoveries about the troubles. Video: BBCA new BBC TV series on the Troubles claims former DUP leader Ian Paisley supplied money to the Ulster Volunteer Force to carry out a number of bombings in 1969.The seven-part series, which starts on Tuesday, also contains rare footage of former deputy first minister Martin McGuinness, of Sinn Féin, allegedly preparing a car bomb for an IRA attack on Derry’s Guildhall in 1972.The series, Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History, also reveals a “top secret” memorandum from 1972 in which British army commander Gen Michael Carver proposed as a “lasting solution” to the conflict that the British government gradually escape from the “commitment to the Border”.The allegations against Paisley in the first programme of the series relate to a number of bombings of water and electricity installations that the UVF and a group called the Ulster Protestant Volunteers carried out in early 1969.At the time, the unionist prime minister Terence O’Neill was trying to bring in reforms to meet some of the demands of the civil rights movement.The UVF hoped the bombings against targets such as the Silent Valley reservoir in the Mourne mountains and the water pipeline at Annalong, Co Down, would be blamed on the IRA. The plan was that it would generate further unionist hostility to an already beleaguered O’Neill and force him to resign.At the time, Paisley had been mounting a campaign of protest against O’Neill, who resigned at the end of April 1969 under claims he had lost control in Northern Ireland.The programme cites a police intelligence report of the period that said the UVF was linked to Paisley, a connection the cleric denied.Viaduct explosionFormer British army officer David Hancock, who served as a major in Northern Ireland from 1968 to 1970, told the programme an RUC district inspector in Kilkeel, Co Down, informed him Paisley had supplied money for the bombings.Mr Hancock, who was stationed nearby, actually heard the Annalong viaduct explosion and said he felt at the time it did “not have the footprint of the IRA”.Mr Hancock recalled: “I was good friends with the district inspector down in Kilkeel. He showed me the evidence that they had of the involvement of money from Paisley into what was then called the UVF, where they got the explosives from, how it was carried out, who did it, and why.”The programme also reports that Samuel Stevenson, Paisley’s bodyguard in 1969, told former SDLP and Fine Gael politician Austin Currie the UVF was planning to bomb the hydroelectric power station at Ballyshannon, Co Donegal. In that attack in October 1969, Thomas McDowell was killed when his bomb exploded prematurely.Mr Currie told the programme Mr Stevenson warned him of the planned attack and also told him he was supposed to be part of the UVF bomb team, but that he would try to avoid being involved.McGuinness footageThe programme also features footage of Mr McGuinness in Derry in 1972 that shows him sitting in a car while children crane in the window to look at bullets. It shows him handling a pistol while talking to them. A rifle lies beside McGuinness in the car.There is also film of IRA members assembling a car bomb in Derry, with Mr McGuinness clearly appearing to be part of the unit. The bomb was then used to damage the Guildhall in March 1972, as was evident from the car’s registration.The day after the attack, in which no one was killed, Stormont prime minister Brian Faulkner was brought to London by UK prime minister Edward Heath to be told the unionist government was being stripped of security powers. Mr Faulkner’s government resigned and direct rule was introduced from Britain shortly afterwards.The McGuinness footage came from an American documentary that was never shown in Britain or Ireland. Mr McGuinness admitted he was in the IRA, although he claimed to have left the organisation in 1974.The first programme in the series also covers Bloody Sunday on January 30th, 1972, and reports how an officer from another regiment described the First Parachute Regiment responsible for 14 deaths in Derry as “hooligans in uniform”.This comment was made shortly before Bloody Sunday and after members of the regiment were accused of brutally dealing with an anti-internment march on Magilligan Strand in Co Derry on January 22nd.Top secret briefingThe programme features part of a “top secret” briefing to British government defence secretary Peter Carrington in May 1972 from Gen Michael Carver headed “Army Aims in Northern Ireland”. In it Gen Carver said the IRA had strengthened its military position since the collapse of Stormont, while the British army was losing the military initiative.Gen Carver appeared to be proposing the British government should facilitate the creation of a united Ireland. “If I am right, and we want a lasting solution, it must be in finding a way in which HMG can gradually escape from the commitment to the border,” he wrote, adding that the “answer appears to lie with the plebiscite”.The series is edited by Jeremy Adams and produced by Chris Thornton, one of the authors of the Lost Lives book of those killed during the Troubles. The reporters for the series, which took two years to make, are Darragh MacIntyre, Mandy McAuley and Jennifer O’Leary.The first programme will broadcast on Tuesday, September 10th, at 8.30pm on BBC1 Northern Ireland and BBC4.Future episodes will deal with issues such as how the IRA sustained its campaign, the intelligence war against the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries, the loyalist Glenanne Gang and how the Troubles were brought to an end."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4009850.1567762647!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"is this the final brexit straw lyons tea may disappear with no deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLyons Tea is made in the UK and is owned by Unilever“There will still be plenty of food on shelves but perhaps not all of the same brands,” the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Thursday night at a British Irish Chamber of Commerce event .He said that Irish shoppers would have to to make some adjustments in their shopping basket in the event of a hard-Brexit - but what does that mean? What products can we expect to see disappear from our shelves. Will we be able to drink the same tea and eat the same biscuits? It is hard to say for sure exactly what will happen as retailers and manufacturers are keeping their contingency plans a closely guarded secret. However those that have spoke about it have assured shoppers that everything will be fine. That may be the case. And it may not be the case. What we do know is that Irish supermarkets are vulnerable to change. That has rarely been clearer than it was when a few days of snow brought by the Beast from the East two years ago led to immediate and unprecedented disruption.There were yawning gaps on Irish supermarket shelves as a chronic lack of resilience across the supply chain became impossible to ignore.With a no-deal Brexit looking increasingly likely, supply chains could face considerably more disruption than was caused by the snow and that could see many lines of fruit and vegetables, dairy products and products with a longer shelf life that currently come from the UK hit with delays.More than €4 billion worth of British food and drink is consumed in the Republic each year and this country is the UK’s main export market for groceries. In a no-deal scenario, prices will climb and products commonly found on our shelves could disappear entirely, at least for a spell.According to a report published by the Economic and Social Research Institute a no-deal Brexit could cost each Irish household an average of €1,400 a year as prices rise. The ESRI used a database of more than 4,500 products routinely imported from Britain and found that the price of bread and cereals in the Republic could rise by up to 30 per cent in a hard-Brexit scenario, while milk, cheese and egg prices could increase 46 per cent. A range of products - including meat, sugar, confectionery, coffee, tea and mineral water - are also likely to increase by 20-30 per cent.But back to the original question? What products could be in shorter supply or gone completely if Boris gets his way?In the Irish tea wars Lyons remains marginally ahead of Barry’s but while the latter is produced in Cork and will be protected from Brexit-Shock, the former is made in the UK and is owned by Unilever. The beans, soups, sauces and salad creams made under this brand most likely come from the Kitt Green factory in Wigan. It has multiple product lines churning in excess of a billion different products out each year before shipping them around the world. Many of those products end up on trucks bound for Ireland. Just two of the more popular soft drinks available in the Republic that are likely to be either in short supply or more expensive in a post -Brexit world, as both product lines are manufactured in a giant processing plant in England’s Forrest of Dean.While the old-school treat is still named after the Rathfarnham farm where is was born, it too is owned by Unilever. It closed its Irish manufacturing plant almost 15 years ago and all the ice cream sold under this brand is, in fact, made in England. It is the most popular soft-drink maker in Ireland and while it has a bottling plant in the Republic, it also has one in Northern Ireland so will have to figure out ways to ensure supply is unaffected with border-crossing difficulties on the cards.This is by some measure Ireland’s most popular washing-up liquid but as it is made in England, if the worst fears are realised, it could be in shorter supply in the year ahead.It is not just the chocolate digestives that will come under the Brexit cosh but all the biscuits in the range including Hob Nobs, Jaffa Cakes and Penguin bars.They’re likely to be scarce too as Burton’s Biscuits, the company behind the beloved brand, has its main factory in south Wales.The flow of the fastest growing tonic water in Ireland is likely to hit some class of dam as it is an English product and supply will either dry up or prices will jump by around 25 per cent."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4010274.1567789006!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no truth in claims that paisley gave cash to uvf for bombings","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIan Paisley jnr with his father the Rev Ian Paisley at The Seven Towers Leisure Centre in Ballymena for the North Antrim seat count in 2010. File photograph: PAClaims made in a BBC TV documentary that Northern Ireland’s former first minister Ian Paisley supplied money to the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) to carry out bombings in 1969 are untrue, his son has said.Ian Paisley jnr said there was “absolutely no truth whatsoever” in the allegations about his late father, and it was a “filthy story designed to try and impugn the reputation of a dead man”.A spokeswoman for the BBC said the corporation has “complete confidence in the editorial integrity of the programme”.In the documentary, a former British army officer, David Hancock – who served as a major in Northern Ireland from 1968 to 1970 – describes how an RUC district inspector in Kilkeel, Co Down, informed him Paisley had supplied money for the bombing of water and electricity installations in early 1969.The UVF hoped that the attacks on targets such as the Silent Valley reservoir in the Mourne mountains and the water pipeline at Annalong, Co Down, would be blamed on the IRA and force Northern Ireland’s beleaguered prime minister, Terence O’Neill, to resign.Mr Hancock recalled: “I was good friends with the district inspector down in Kilkeel. He showed me the evidence that they had of the involvement of money from Paisley into what was then called the UVF, where they got the explosives from, how it was carried out, who did it and why.”The programme cites a police intelligence report of the period that said the UVF was linked to Paisley, a connection the cleric denied.Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster’s Nolan Show, Ian Paisley jnr described the claims as “gossip”, and said his father had been in prison when the bombings took place.Ian Paisley snr was jailed in March 1969 for organising an illegal counterdemonstration to a civil rights march in Armagh the previous year.The founder of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Paisley snr was its leader for 37 years. He died in 2014, aged 88.Mr Paisley said what was “probably most hurtful and disgusting” was that the programme is scheduled to be broadcast on the fifth anniversary of his father’s death.“That’s particularly hurtful to my mother and particularly hurtful to the rest of my family,” he said.‘Incandescent’ widowHe said in the last 24 hours he had spoken to his mother, Baroness Eileen Paisley, about the claims made in the programme, and she had “completely dismissed them out of hand”.She was “incandescent”, he said, “that the BBC wouldn’t even approach her and speak to her about it.“They never contacted my mother and never contacted myself,” he said. “No one in my family was given a chance to defend the reputation of my late father, no one was contacted to do that. He was in jail. If they had sufficient evidence to put to him about all of this they would have done so. The story is untrue, and there is absolutely no credible evidence or basis on which to make the allegations they have made.”A BBC spokeswoman said “as no allegations were made against the wider Paisley family it was not necessary to offer them a right to reply”.“The series leads our autumn programming and was scheduled to follow on from BBC Northern Ireland’s portfolio of news-related content recognising the 50th anniversary of troops entering Northern Ireland in 1969.”The seven-part series, Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History, begins on Tuesday on BBC1 Northern Ireland and BBC Four.It also contains rare footage of former Sinn Féin deputy first minister Martin McGuinness allegedly preparing a car bomb for an IRA attack on Derry’s Guildhall in 1972 and reveals a “top secret” memorandum from 1972 in which British army commander Gen Michael Carver proposed as a “lasting solution” to the conflict that the British government gradually escape from the “commitment to the Border”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4010221.1567785688!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"speed camera operators vote to go on strike","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe trade union Siptu said its members employed by GoSafe overwhelmingly backed industrial action in a ballot conducted on Friday.

Photograph: MaxwellThe hospitable hosts buttered up their important guest and made a big fuss of his family and hoped he would say nice things about them to the important people he would meet after his visit to Ireland.And he told them they were wonderful and that he loved them. He even said a special prayer for everyone and then, just before he left, he turned around and kicked them where it hurts.It came as a shock.Like pulling out all the stops for a much-anticipated visitor to your home and thinking it has been a great success until somebody discovers he shat on the new carpet in the spare room, the one you bought specially for him.US vice-president Mike Pence met President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Tuesday during an official visit. His Irish hosts, up to their oxters for the last three years in Brexit worry, hoped to impress upon him Ireland’s fears about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit for the country.He could, maybe, stick in a supportive word for us in his talks with Boris Johnson in London,\u0026nbsphis next port of call.Pence, after all, is Irish American and wastes no opportunity to go misty-eyed about his love for the “Old Country” as he lards on his Mother Machree shtick on both sides of the Atlantic. He couldn’t praise Ireland enough on Tuesday – “deeply humbled” and “honoured” to be going to the hometown of his mother’s grandmother and so on.But, after he said all these nice things about the “Emerald Isle” and how much his boss Donald Trump – he sent his best wishes, by the way – appreciates us and all we do to help American security in Shannon, he delivered a very strong endorsement of Boris Johnson and Brexit.No room left for doubt. As Pence read from the autocue and Irish eyes definitely stopped smiling, it was clear he was channelling His Master’s Voice. Trump is a fan of Brexit and of Boris.And this, after such a lovely morning, with Pence and his mother meeting the Taoiseach and his mother.His Irish mother, as Mike calls her. He dotes on Nancy. So he should have known that any Irish mammy will tell you if you can’t say anything good, say nothing at all.Instead, he veered off his rather gushing statement following his meeting with the Taoiseach into some crunching Brexit remarks about our duty to do right by Boris Johnson and the UK.As the air in the steamy ballroom turned decidedly frosty, Pence urged Ireland and the European Union “to negotiate in good faith” with the new British prime minister.The local crowd raised eyebrows and wondered what he thinks the aforementioned EU has been doing for the last three years, if not negotiating in good faith with the UK.Varadkar’s expression didn’t change. He stood on the platform beside the vice-president and hardly flinched, smiling politely.Even when Pence made it worse by not only mentioning “good faith” and “Boris Johnson” in the same context but by also requesting his hosts to have “respect for the UK’s sovereignty”, Varadkar maintained a stoic courtesy.He had to. It’s in the job description for normal prime ministers.Same goes for Michael D Higgins, even though it would be true to say that Michael D and Mike Pence do not sing from the same hymn sheet.But international diplomacy is what it is and in the context of going about their nations’ business, everyone has to be seen to get along.But for all that, Michael D’s sprayed-on smile when the US vice-president came to visit him in Áras an Uachtaráin was a joy to behold.The Áras was bedecked with flowers from the garden for the visit of the anti-gay-rights Pence. All the flowers were in shades of pink. The only other colour was lavender.Pence arrived with a huge entourage. President Higgins escorted him through the Áras and into the ballroom where he invited his guest to sign the visitors’ book. Michael D looked ahead a lot of the time. “Can I invite you to sign. . . ” he motioned towards the book.Pence sat at the table and began to write. The President stood to one side, saying nothing apart from the occasional whisper to his wife, Sabina. The VP kept writing as the silence got louder. Still writing. Michael D looking into the distance.Finally, thank God, Pence stopped writing, which was a relief all round. There was another photo opportunity then the party retired next door for tea. A picture was released of the two groups sitting on either side of a long table – two tables together.The sort of thing when more guests than expected arrive. “Quick, run out next door and ask Assumpta for the collapsible table they got in for Mossie’s wake. Your man from America is only after arriving with half of Indiana. Where’s the big tablecloth?”The talks between the President and the vice-president didn’t take long. Soon, they were waving goodbye from the portico. The dogs didn’t put in an appearance.He didn’t call the vice-president a “w*****r”, which is what he did when he had a row many years on radio with a famous American conservative commentator. Michael Graham was his name. Michael D might easily have become confused, because Mike Pence is an adherent of the “Graham rule”. This is where he doesn’t stay alone in a room with a woman who is not his wife so as not to give rise to bad thoughts and the like.At Farmleigh House, Varadkar’s static courtesy was equally impressive. But then, the Taoiseach has dined before in Pence’s presence.“We are all God’s children,” Leo pointedly told him when they met for breakfast last March in Washington. Just to be clear, they met for breakfast in a roomful of other people. The two men weren’t dining alone, perish the thought.It was a very pleasant event. This was when Leo invited his American host to Ireland and told him to bring along his mother too. It would be a grand trip for her and, in an emergency, if Mike’s wife was otherwise detained, mammy could sit in as chaperone should the VP have found himself unavoidably alone in a dining room with our gay Taoiseach.You can never be too careful. In the end, Pence brought his wife, his mother and his sister to the Old Country, where it seems a lot of the natives have turned alarmingly heathen in the generations since his ancestors left our shores.His morning began with a trip to the Phoenix Park and a courtesy call on the President.To look at Mike Pence, with all smiles and handshakes, you’d hardly think he isn’t very keen on the gays at all.Brave Mike sat down to lunch with the Taoiseach and his partner, Matthew, and managed not to choke on his Dublin Bay prawns. The VP’s wife Karen, who recently took up a part-time teaching position in a school which bans LGBT pupils and staff, kept her fillets of venison down despite the company.The next prime minister the couple will meet on their trip will be the serial philanderer Boris Johnson. He’s pretty experienced on the extramarital and premarital sex front, which they abhor.On Tuesday, to be on the safe side, nobody was left alone with the US vice-president in case it might upset him.“We have both been blessed with Irish mothers,” Pence told the Taoiseach when they met the press. He didn’t say anything about Indian fathers (in Leo’s case) but there you go.“I carry Ireland with me wherever I go,” said Pence, speaking of an old Ireland, one his ancestors left generations ago.Still, his visit was a great example of ersity in action. President Trump, who recently visited, is very hands-on with women and likes to grab them in all sorts of places. And his second in command is the opposite. He won’t stay on his own with a woman who isn’t his wife."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Hillary Clinton praises Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s charity work in supportive Instagram postExhausted Zimbabweans mark Mugabe\u0026#39s death with ambivalence as they battle difficulties of daily lifeSavoy Hotel doorman caught on CCTV kicking homeless man repeatedly in the faceBoy, 15, fatally stabbed, bringing number of killings in London to 100 in 2019Two women tell French investigators they were assaulted by Epstein’s friend Jean-Luc BrunelBritish Airways and pilots must \u0026#39sort out\u0026#39 pay dispute so holidays aren\u0026#39t ruined, Downing Street saysComment: The Remainers\u0026#39 scorched earth tactics and premature triumphalism will rebound spectacularlyPrince William and Boris Johnson back first national memorial for emergency service workers\u0026#39This memorial will reset our national view of emergency workers\u0026#39Dallas Opera cancels gala after new sexual harassment claims against Placido Domingo Jo Johnson declares support for his brother\u0026#39s domestic policy in bid to limit the damage of his resignationDozens more kidneys could be donated after doctors successfully cure transplant organ with hepatitis CViolence was always in Robert Mugabe\u0026#39s political DNABrexit latest news: Rebel bill passes in the Lords and heads for Royal Assent as opposition leaders vow to reject Boris Johnson\u0026#39s election bidProsecutors considering charging former police officer over handling of Lord Janner sex abuse investigationTriplets whose DNA was found on guns are jailed\u0026#39I know what death smells like\u0026#39: fears Bahamas death toll will soar amid search for hundreds still missingComment: My Sky News scrap with Kay Burley revealed the anti-Brexit media bias that is harming the public trustAfter Robert Mugabe\u0026#39s death, what next for Grace?Comment: Why is the BBC so quick to listen to Chris Packham and his friends in the RSPB?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/09/06/TELEMMGLPICT000208540071_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq8nnkrQsf6wWbTqXfckLxgQH6uOygPZs_VXFAmaa0PQc.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"amazons frequently bought together feature suggests 14 year","story":"After adding a £22.99 \u0026#39college school bag\u0026#39 to his virtual basket, the teenager was offered a large kitchen knife to go with itLaw and orderAmazon\u0027s \u0027frequently bought together\u0027 feature suggested a 14-year-old buy a knife with his school rucksack, his police officer father has revealed.Alister Bonafia, from Kettering, Northamptonshire, was searching for a backpack online while getting ready for the start of a new school year.But after adding a £22.99 \u0027college school bag\u0027 to his virtual basket, the website offered him a large kitchen knife to go with it.Alister immediately told his father Wiz, a special constable with Northamptonshire Police.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearThe cryptocurrency hit a record high\u0026nbspof $20,000 in 2017, coinciding with record-high search levels on Google.Since the recent online search surge, the price of bitcoin has risen steadily, but is nowhere near the levels it reached two years ago.\u0026nbspThe cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $10,800, having been trading below $9,400 before 29 August.The rising price over the last week\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspbeen attributed to escalating economic and geopolitical uncertainty around the globe.Market analysts told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspearlier this week that turmoil surrounding Brexit, along with the trade war between the US and China, had caused investors to turn to bitcoin as a relatively safe haven asset.However, this analysis came before this search trend was spotted and some now believe that it may be having a significant impact on the price. It\u0026nbspremains unclear is who is behind it and how they are doing it.It is reasonable to assume that someone is behind these radical changes, wrote cryptocurrency analyst Bendik Norheim Schei.\u0026nbspThat the same pattern can be seen all over the world may indicate that VPN services have been used to distribute the search across the world, thus achieving a global trend.The price of bitcoin is notoriously volatile and is often difficult to both predict and explain.The correlation between online search interest and bitcoin\u0027s price has until now been a rare constant.\u0026nbspA study in 2017 found that high search volumes for bitcoin-related terms like \u0027btc usd\u0027 often preceded price bubbles, while low engagement usually signalled a good time to buy.Data gathered by digital marketing firm SemRush noted an 80 per cent correlation between search volume and bitcoin\u0027s price, though no conclusions were drawn as to which was the determining factor.Cryptocurrency analyst Anton Lucian described\u0026nbspthe latest increase in bitcoin search levels as just plain strange and pointed to manipulation as the likely culprit.Bitcoin investor and author Glen Goodman explained how such manipulation might be used to augment the price of the cryptocurrency.There are algorithms programmed to look at Google Trends data and try to find correlations between numbers of searches for the word \u0027btc\u0027 and the movements in the bitcoin price, he said.If they detect patterns, it may be profitable to trade off that data. This hacker may be buying some bitcoin, then sending a ton of \u0027btc\u0027 search queries to Google.\u0026nbspThe algoirthms see search numbers have risen and are triggered to buy a lot of bitcoin, which pushes the price up, and the hacker then sells their bitcoin at a profit. Easy money.Google has measures to prevent people manipulating searches, though practices like Google Bombing have proved in the past that it is possible to game the system.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsphas reached out to Google for comment.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The same is true of construction, 45 down from 45.3, and manufacturing, 47.4 down from 48. The difference is the latter two sectors are now shrinking, as is business activity overall. UK plc only avoided a cricketing hat-trick because the video replay umpire didn’t overturn a marginal LBW decision made on the field after the third ball.\u0026nbspUK manufacturing output slumps to seven-year low amid Brexit concernsPMI survey reveals biggest slide in UK construction output since 2009How a no-deal Brexit will affect the economy — now and in the futureBusiness expectations are at their lowest for three years, with economists starting to pencil in the first recession since the financial crisis, unless there is a dramatic pick up in September. It’s hard to see where the fairy dust might come from.\u0026nbspThese are the sort of figures that should be of deep concern to any sane and sensible government of whatever hue, all the more so to\u0026nbspa Conservative government with its\u0026nbspmuch ballyhooed, and largely undeserved, reputation for economic competence. In more normal times, they’d scare the pants off it.\u0026nbspBut these are not normal times and this is not a normal government. It is run by a party that has completely lost its marbles, having been dragged to the edge of a cliff by gangsters who have just one policy of note. \u0026nbspThe global situation mightn’t be terribly cheery, but the contraction that is getting underway in Britain is an entirely self created one, a squeeze manufactured in Downing Street.\u0026nbspAnd remember, this could just be a taste of what’s\u0026nbspto come, a red balloon or two of warning of what Johnnywise the dancing clown of Downing Street could yet brings down on us as he emerges from his sinister house.\u0026nbspThis brings us to another set of figures published this morning. They concern household debt and come courtesy of the TUC ahead of its annual Congress.\u0026nbspThey give voice to the disturbing level of unsecured borrowing engaged in by the average Briton before one even starts to consider things such as mortgages.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He added: “The PMIs are excessively influenced by business sentiment and have given a misleadingly weak steer during the past 12 months of heightened political uncertainty.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Speaking to IGN, the film’s songwriter Kiristen Anderson-Lopez said that Elsa won’t be romantically linked to any character in the sequel.“Like the first movie, Elsa is not just defined by a romantic interest,” she said. “There’s so many movies that define a woman by her romantic interest. That’s not a story that we wanted to tell at this point in time.

The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”.

Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. While this suggests that Disney might reveal Elsa to be openly lesbian in a future instalment, it won’t be happening in the new film.The campaign to make\u0026nbspElsa Disney’s first LGBTQ+ princess began in 2016. Named #GiveElsaAGirlfriend, it hoped to encourage the studio\u0026nbspto improve\u0026nbsprepresentation in its movies.“I love everything people are saying and people are thinking about with our film,” co-director Jennifer Lee said in response.Robert Downey Jr ‘returning as Iron Man’ in new Marvel projectDisney has released the first look at Emma Stone as Cruella de VilFrozen 2 breaks record as most watched animated trailer in first dayFrozen was widely praised as being one of the studio’s most LGBT-friendly productions yet.\u0026nbspMindhunter star Jonathan Groff is Disney Animation’s first openly gay actor to play the protagonist’s love interest, while character Oaken (Chris Williams)\u0026nbspis arguably the studio’s most visible LGBT character, thanks to\u0026nbspa brief shot in the film of what appears to be his husband and children.Frozen 2\u0026nbsparrives in UK cinemas on 27 November 2019.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The research showed that the marks on their genomes that represent their “epigenetic clock”, as well as their immune systems, actually improved despite the passing of time.The scientists involved in the study were shocked by the results.“I’d expected to see slowing down of the clock, but not a reversal,” researcher Steve\u0026nbspHorvath\u0026nbspfrom the University of California, Los Angeles told Nature, which first reported the findings. “That felt kind of futuristic.”Scientists caution that the study was done with a very limited number of participants: only nine people took the drug cocktail, and there was no control group. But if it is confirmed by further research it could have huge impacts on healthcare, the treatment of disease and how people think about\u0026nbspageing.Created with Sketch.Science Photographer of the Year shortlist  Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.19 Soap bubble structures showing light interference colours and patterningBubbles want to optimise space and minimise their surface area for a given volume of air.

Scientists\u0026nbspthen monitored\u0026nbspthe test subjects’\u0026nbspepigenetic clocks, to understand the effect\u0026nbspon how they aged.Nobel Prize given to scientists who explained the biological clockThe epigenetic clock is measured by the body’s\u0026nbspepigenome\u0026nbsp– a record of chemical changes to an organism’s DNA. As people age, chemical modifications or tags are added to people’s DNA, and those change throughout their lives,\u0026nbspso by looking at those tags\u0026nbspa person’s biological age can be measured.Researchers had actually intended to look at how the growth hormone would change the tissue in the thymus gland, which helps with the body’s immune functions and sits in the chest. It normally shrinks after puberty but they hoped to see whether it could be pushed to regrow, by giving participants the growth hormone.It was only as a secondary consideration that researchers then checked how the drugs changed their epigenetic clocks. The study had finished when the analysis began.Professor Horvath then looked at four different measures of the epigenetic clock to understand the differing ages of each of the patients. And he found that every one of them had reversed significantly – so significantly that he is optimistic about the results, despite the limited number of participants.Scientists now hope to test the same effects with more people, through a controlled study, and with different age groups, ethnicities and with women.The changes could still be seen in the blood of six participants who provided samples\u0026nbsplong after the study finished.Some of the drugs used in the cocktail are already being researched as ways of fighting age-related diseases. But the discovery of the combined effect of the three of them could have major implications for the ways that a variety of different drugs are tested, scientists say.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Heres what the bookies think...British bookies have slashed the odds on there being a General Election in .According to the Oddschecker website, some firms are offering odds of  o on there being a general election in .“Boris Johnson’s coup has sent shockwaves across the country since its announcement, and those shockwaves have translated into political betting money, said Oddscheckers Callum Wilson.“A betting flurry has taken place today on a General Election taking place before the end of the year, and it seems almost inevitable that we’ll see one, according to the heavily odds-on prices.”William Hill are offering odds of   on the UK going to the polls in .That suggests Britain has a  per cent chance of a General Election before the end of the year with money starting to trickle in for a Lib Dem victory.Boris Johnson certainly wants one now that  rebel Tory MPs joined with the opposition in backing a law that would block a No Deal Brexit.The PM now believes he needs a fresh mandate from voters to prise a new deal from EU leadersHe has said any move to block a No Deal Brexit would weaken his hand in attempting to negotiate an agreement with Brussels.If MPs backed a bill that would force him to seek an extension to our leaving datethere was no deal, then he would seek a general election.After they did just that, the Prime Minister followed suit with a motion seeking the two-thirds majority needed to go to the polls on October .But the vote was lost after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn ordered his MPs to abstain in the knowledge this would prevent Boris getting the two thirds majority he needed.A motion for the snap poll would be tabled by the Government which would require the support of two-thirds of MPs under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act .Boris could try and call a snap election at any time.He would have to pass a vote of MPs in the Commons first, however, thanks to the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act.Elections in this country take place on a Thursday.By law, Parliament is dissolved  working days before a General election."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit block useful work westminster","story":"Sometimes these show the skull and crossbones, to frighten any would-be intruders. The message is clear: Useful work is no longer done here.If Remainer MPs block Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan this week, we should place similar signs around the Palace of Westminster.Parliamentarians will have turned the place into a toxic waste ground which no longer fulfils a decent .It will have become an eyesore, a municipal liability, an assembly which no longer represents its voters and has become a poisonous threat to them. It will stand as sad testament to the misjudgement of its management in latter days.If Speaker John Bercow, former Chancellor Philip Hammond and other dead-set Remainers such as Sir Keir Starmer refuse to enact the  referendum result, the British Parliament — supposedly the fount of modern parliamentary democracy — will have lost its centuries-old claim to give voice to the people. The consequences of that would be enormous.The word “Parliament”, first used in these islands in the early s, comes from the French “parler” .The th Century Parliament was where leading men of England could let the king know how they felt about his laws and taxes. Kings did not always take much notice but the principle was established: That the people of England would be heard by their ruler.Over the ages, the people slowly became the boss. Until now.Sometimes you will hear the Commons derided as a talking-shop but that, correctly, is what it is. Talking can prevent violence.There is a reason modern heads of government are not, by and large, stabbed in their beds like poor King Duncan in Shakespeare’s Macbeth.That reason has been the parliamentary process and the comforting knowledge that when push came to shove, parliamentarians would be on our side.Our side, please note. Not on the side of rival countries.There developed a quiet understanding that on issues of conscience , MPs need not slavishly follow their constituents. They were not quite delegates.But as representatives, they would be expected to follow broadly the sympathies of their electors and the policies of their parties. Otherwise they could just lie at election time then do the opposite once they had won their seats in the Commons.In his address outside  Downing Street last night, Boris left people in no doubt of his intentions to see us out of the EU after October .But when MPsto the Commons this afternoon, you will hear Remainers complain that “Parliament has been bypassed” in the Brexit process. This is tommyrot.As can happen in modern politics, it is the very opposite of the truth. I’m afraid they’re lying. They are ignoring you — the electorate — and they think you are too busyto notice.The EU referendum in  was set up by the Commons.The Commons approved the Article  process under which we told Brussels we were off. All well and good.David Cameron would not have won the  election had he not promised a referendum.Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn would not have attracted millions of votes in the  election had they not promised to respect the Leave result.But now that our departure is imminent, Remainer extremists such as Hammond, Bercow, Gauke, Grieve, Soubryplan to try to stop it.They have already bent the rules doing so and will possibly do so again today.Please, guys: Spare us any bleating about “constitutional outrages” by Boris. Your behaviour has been far worse.These swivel-eyed Europhiles have decided that the Leave vote of  — the biggest exercise in British electoral history — must be neutralised.The plebs got it wrong. Computer does not recognise. Reboot time. All past data has been lost.Just look at that warped figure Tony Blair, who treated Parliament with open contempt when he was PM.Yesterday he was throwing up his soft hands in horror at the idea of a new General Election to break the Westminster deadlock. He opposes an election because he knows it could result in a big win for an on-fire Boris. All this from the same Tony Blair whose regime helped kill hundreds of thousands of Iraqis in the name of, er, democracy.Instead, Blair wants a second referendum, whose wording would be decidedby the current, pro-EU, electorate-defying Parliament.We used to laugh at communist assemblies in countries such as North Korea, which were stuffed full of identikit dummies.We mocked minnows such as Ireland, which were forced by Brussels to re-run referendums that produced “wrong” results.We thought our democracy was more authentic because Parliament was connected to its constituents and because our politicians accepted the electorate’s verdict.We won’t be able to make such boastsWestminster’s Remainers have their way.What is the point of a parliamentit ignores the electorate  None. Many of these Remainer MPs seem readier to take their cue from Twitter users than from their own voters. It’s weird and it is not democracy.If our Parliament ceases to have a point, so do its buildingsand so do its members’ privileges .The very nation state becomes questionable, for what is the point of a state without a democratic Parliament Before long you find yourself asking what is the point of Western Europe, Nato and the whole web of Western values that separate us from Putin’s Russia and other hostile powers.Such is the importance of the decisions facing our MPs this week. Let’s hope they ponder hard before vetoing Brexit, the greatest-ever popular demand for change. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Suddenly, the all-encompassing full-time job into which you poured all your time and effort becomes harder to juggle with what’s going on at home.Ruth Davidson is the case in point, after tendering her resignation as leader of the Scottish Conservatives because, among other reasons, the thought of getting on the road to fight two elections in  months would have once fired her up but now fills her with dread.Ruth, who will remain as an MSP, adds: “Additionally, I fear that having tried to be a good leader over the years, I have proved a poor daughter, sister, partner and friend.

It is a pathetic showing for a main opposition party at a time when it should be sailing ahead.Corbyn — branded a chicken by Boris Johnson for blocking a snap election — is doing so much worse than he did in his unexpectedly strong  ­election campaign.That’s because voters have seen so much more of this unreconstructed Marxist than they had then. And the more they see, the less they like it.Gradually it is dawning on the country that the economic policies advanced by Corbyn and his even more left-wing shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, would not so much redistribute national wealth as obliterate it.Earlier this week McDonnell came up with his latest wheeze for robbing the rich and — as he sees it — giving to the poor.He promised to give private tenants a “right to buy” their homes at a discount. I can see why this policy might initially seem attractive to young people who have been priced out of the housing market — a group with whom I have a lot of sympathy.Notionally, the policy may seem little dferent from Mrs Thatcher’s right to buy which enabled a generation of council house tenants to become homeowners for the first time.But there is every dference. If private investors were forced to sell their properties at a discount it would crash the housing market. Who would want to buy a property, knowing that the Government could come along at any moment and confiscate it If you crash the housing market, you crash the ­mortgage market, too. Private tenants might in theory gain the right to buy their homes, but that will not be much usebanks refuse to lend them any money.Confiscation is a thread which runs through so much of Labour’s programme.McDonnell has already announced a plan to snatch ten per cent of the shares of all private companies with more than  employees.He wants to put these shares into what he calls an inclusive ownership fund, invested on behalf of the workers.The workers shouldn’t get too excited, though. They would be allowed a maximum of £ a year in idends — and that onlytheir ­company was able to pay a idend.Meanwhile, the value of ordinary people’s pensions would plummet by far more than £. According to an analysis by law firm Clford Chance, workers would gain £billion — but overall, investors would lose £billion as share values crashed.Labour’s plan would dilute a company’s shares, effectively confiscating wealth from existing shareholders.Corbyn and McDonnell ­promote a fantasy that shareholders are a bunch of capitalist fatcats.Yet the reality is that almost everyone who works in the private sector is indirectly a shareholder. Share investments form the bedrock of the pension funds on which we will rely in old age.EvenMcDonnell was only helping himself to ten per cent of company shares initially, he could be sure to come back for more when his tax revenues failed to match his vast spending plans.These include spending £billion nationalising utility companies — that is £billion for gas and electricity firms, £billion for water firms, £billion to buy out Private Finance Initiativecontracts for schools and hospitals and £.billion for the Royal Mail.Labour claims this will save householders an average of £ a year on the basis that these firms will no longer have to pay shareholders.But he overlooks the poor record of nationalised industry. Lower efficiency could well lead to higher prices.How is McDonnell going to bring in the revenue for his massive spending plans He seems to live under the delusion thatyou raise taxes by x per cent, revenue, too, will rise by x per cent.Thus he claimed, in Labour’s  manesto, that reversing corporation tax cuts would raise £billion. But tax doesn’t work like that. In fact, cuts to corporation tax made by George Osborne increased revenue as multinationals erted profits to, rather than away from, Britain.So it is perverse for Labour to claim jacking up rates again will raise extra money. On the contrary, McDonnell would likely end up with LESS revenue.As for iniduals, McDonnell has promised to increase income tax for the top ten per cent of earners, which means anyone on more than £, a year. The top rate of income tax would go up to  per cent.But the real damage could come from a wealth tax — an annual levy on the value of homes, shares, bonds and all other assets.Although not yet Labour party policy, McDonnell has previously expressed approval for a whopping  per cent levy on the wealthiest ten per cent of the population.It wouldn’t be the super-wealthy who paid — they would quickly be off.In the s, a high-tax Labour ­government caused a brain drain which led to net outwards migration of , people over a few years.It would be worse now, as wealthy iniduals and businesses are much more mobile compared with the s.The real victims of a wealth tax would be ordinary people who have spent years saving to buy a home and build themselves a half-decent pension. To qualy for McDonnell’s wealth tax you would only need to own a home, and to have a pension with a combined value of £,.With Labour on just  per cent in the polls, of course, the nightmare of a Corbyn government — or at least a Corbyn majority government — is at the moment unlikely.But no one should be ­complacent.We could all too easily end up with a Labour-SNP coalition with the ­Scottish Nationalists happy to inflict pain on English, Welsh and Northern Irish voters infor the promise of a second independence referendum.Over the past couple of years we have had endless attempts to blame Brexit for every economic woe. Actually, over that period, employment has risen to an all-time high and the economy, except for the last quarter, has grown.But international investors, have been shy of Britain.The uncertainty over Brexit doesn’t help but talk to wealth managers and they tell you a very dferent story.What really strikes terror into investors is the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn arriving at the door to No.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They’re not all “champions”, or possibly even the best each respective part of the Cowell empire has to offer.That goose was cooked the moment SuBo, Diversity, Dennis Egeland almost everyone  with a signicant career or talent declined to appear.There was a certain curiosity value to BGT: The Champions, though, I’ll admit, as it featured several performers doing the one thing everyone in their country should arguably be forbidden from even attempting.Indian salsa, Ukrainian sand-painting, Australian stand-up comedy, Indonesian magic, British dog dancing.This last one was  winner Ashleigh Butlerwho began by revealing that, moments before Pudsey died: “He lted his head and had a little look at me.That was him saying ‘Goodbye’.” Or  him saying: “You’ll be going through the same motions, with some hyperactive little impostor, in two years’ time, mark my words.”I got the impression everyone  at the show thought it might just be “a bit too soon”, as well, which may not entirely explain The Champions’ in-built British bias.But the line-up was certainly front-loaded with other familiar faces, Paul Potts, Boogie Storm and Connie Talbot, who’s doubled in size since we last saw her, with Piers Morgan, in . So’s Piers Morgan, for that matter.The great unknown factors were the foreign acts, though, who proved to be a pretty forgettable bunch apart from America’s “comic daredevil” Bello Nock, whose wheel of death t***tery, with daughter Annaliese, was almost as terrying as his appearance,which was described perfectly, by David Walliams, as “Jedward’s dad”.It was certainly enough to hypnotise the Wembley arena audience into voting him the winner.If all this exotica and the set were designed to make us think we were watching something on the scale of Eurovision, though, it failed. The Champions is nothing like as good.Nor is it even as original as Going For Gold, with Henry Kelly, for the simple reason BGT has been welcoming foreign acts for years.All this adds up to is Britain’s Got Talent minus the best bit, the auditions. We also don’t get a chance to vote, either.That came down to a golden buzzer Amanda Holden went for the Ukrainian sandpainter and the arena vote for Bello Nock.Quite something, isn’t it, when we can’t even win such a heavily loaded show and, I have to tell you, Paul Potts took it pretty badly. Simon Cowell, though, had some words of comfort for Ashleigh.“Pusdey’s in dog heaven, looking down on you now, thinking . . . ” “I was the talent. I was the bloody talent.”DIVA Forever’s Gemma Collins landed in Los Angeles last Wednesday night on ITVBe with all the charm and subtlety of a jolt from the San Andreas Fault.Take comfort, though, from the fact our gain is very much Calornia’s loss.Because within five minutes of arriving she’d already decided, “I ain’t going back to England”, and was using her new catchphrase to describe everything.Hamburgers  “Next level.” Hollywood Hills mansions  “Next level.” The Beverly Wilshire hotel  It’s next friggin’ level. She seemed to have her priorities right, though.Before going anywhere near a green card applicationshe got pretend friend Jonathan Cheban to take her to cosmetic surgeon to the stars, Doctor Simon Ourian: “Because I want a facelt while I’m here.How long will I need ” How long have you got, Gemma  It’s next level.FINAL word on Celebs Go Dating belongs to ­brilliant narrator Rob Beckett.Lauren Goodger: “Everyone’s, like, ‘Did you find love, did you meet anyone ’And I’m, like, yeah I did.

And Piers as well. IF this fth series of Peaky Blinders achieves nothing , then Irish actor Brian “Jimmy McCavern” Gleeson’s attempt at a Scottish accent has certainly highlighted the problems of frictionless borders.Back and forth it pings between Dublin and Belfast.With the odd stop-off in downtown Hyderabad, before settling at something closer to Hercule Poirot Belgian rather than the leader of a depression-era Glaswegian razor gang thug he’s meant to be.It has a knock-on effect as well. Notice one thing that’s wrong with the show, you’ll probably notice everything  as well.Like the fact it’s all over the place historically, Paul “Arthur” Anderson is over-acting so badly the estate of Yosemite Sam should sue and Helen McCrory doesn’t look foxy dressed up as Janet Jackson. She just looks ridiculous.Underneath all that baggage and the obtrusive soundtrack, there is, I think, a serviceable enough plot involving Oswald Mosley, the IRA, the UVF, even though they weren’t formed until , and all sorts of carnage involving gypsies and Glasgow’s infamous Billy Boys gang, which our friend Brian Gleeson attempted to put into sharp focus at the end of Sunday night’s episode.“Zo, Tummy ­Shell-beee, it’s wuuuurgh yur wunt, it’s wurgh you zjall ’ave.” No, me neither.THIS week’s winner is BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker and Beaker from The Muppets.Compiled by Graham WrayJONATHAN Ross, in , to producer Andy Davies, on the subject of his -year-old neighbour: “I think you should, just for charity, give her one.”Jonathan Ross, in August , to Judge Rinder, on the subject of Brazilian President Bolsonaro’s disparaging remarks about Emmanuel Macron’s we: “I’m team Macron.It’s the most pathetic and most misogynistic thing they could say. It’s pretty awful, it’s pretty horrible really.”Jonathan, you’re a helluva guy.Sink Or Swim, Arg: “I’m going to be the plus-sized Michael Phelps.”And for all those wondering what the technical term for that is, it’s Michael Feltz.LIKE most of you, I watched a lively old bird called Judith serenade four sets of shrivelling male goolies with a chorus of The Lord Is My Shepherd before taking all of her clothes off on Wednesday night’s Naked Attraction.Then I switched over to Newsnight, where arch-Remainer Paul Mason was discussing Brexit and, I promise you, he sounded about a thousand times more unhinged. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Which might seem weird, but when a Prime Minister elected by a handful of golf club bores with no majority attempts to drive us off a clf, it seems quite logical that a Rasputin figure should call the shots. And Dominic Cummings ­undoubtedly is. The man who ­masterminded Vote Leave by making his goons repeat ad nauseam the soundbite “take back control” has come up with another one to keep his master in power: “the surrender bill”. That’s the mantra every Tory will spout over the coming weeks to describe Parliament’s legitimate over-ruling of Johnson’s reckless attempt to force through a no-deal Brexit. And it works for them on many levels. It fits their depiction of all ­politicians who don’t buy into their vision as cowards and traitors. It paints Johnson as a liberator of oppressed people. And with the implied surrender being to European dictators, it takes them back to their comfort zone: the Second World War.  That’s where right-wingers withdraw to when they want to claim a monopoly on patriotism. Back to the myth that Britain alone, under a Tory leader, defeated the Nazis – even though anyone whose brain hasn’t been pickled in a Wetherspoon’s cask knows three other factors were equally as vital: American money, Russian blood and the English Channel. Never in the psyche of any nation has one war obsessed so many for so long. During the ­referendum campaign buses blared the soundtrack to The Great Escape and roadside ­billboards urged drivers to “Halt ze German advance! Vote Leave”. David Davis said“our civil service can cope with World War Two it can easily cope with this”. His TA chum, Mark ­Francois, claimed “my father was a D-Day veteran, he never submitted to bullying by any German. Neither will his son”. And another Tory said that Hitler had tried to turn Europe into a single entity and “the EU is an attempt to do this by dferent methods”.  That man  Prime Minister Johnson – who has a Churchill ­obsession. Look at the jutting jaw, listen to those calls for the British lion to roar, read his bang-average book The Churchill Factor: How One Man Made History, where the author draws countless parallels with himself. Which only shows how ludicrous one of his Cummings-inspired acts this week was: Sacking Churchill’s grandson as a Tory MP for not buying into ­Johnson’s Churchillian vision, even though Nicholas Soames believes Winston would have remained in the EU. It’s utter madness but it will get more insane as an election looms. The Tories will label Jeremy Corbyn a “lentil-eating surrender monkey” and mock him up as Lord Haw-Haw. There will be more pictures of Spitfires taking off in their TV broadcasts than new cars rolling off our production lines, and at rallies you’ll hear speeches effectively saying that VE Day should have guaranteed Britain supremacy over Europeans forever. And at next Saturday’s Last Night of the Proms, Johnson, dressed in a bowler hat and bow tie, pulling on a cigar, will be seen weeping as he sings “Britons never, ever shall be slaves”.

The Lib Dem MP, who was relected as the Labour MP for the South London seat of Streatham, said he will try and take the City and Westminster seat from Mr Field. The former Foreign Office Minister apologised in June when a video emerged of him grabbing a protestor by the throat. Mr Field has a majority of just , at the  election in the constituency where  per cent of residents voted Remain in . Mr Umunna told the Evening Standard : “I worked as a solicitor in the City and West End and I know they are the last places that should be represented by one of Mr Johnson’s MPs who has just voted to enable a no-deal Brexit .    “The City is the centre of international values, while the West End is home to our greatest creative industries. These centres are telling us that Brexit will be bad for them.” Mr Umunna quit the Labour party in February and joined the ill fated Change UK before defecting again to the Lib Dems in June. “I resigned from the Labour Party primarily because of the party’s failure to oppose Brexit, the racism towards Jewish people in the party, and Jeremy Corbyn’s poor leadership. Whilst it is important to win seats from Labour, it is also vital we win seats from Boris Johnson’s populist nationalist Tory party - which is doing so much damage to our country - in order to stop Brexit and build a more liberal, inclusive and equal Britain.  The overwhelming majority of residents in the Cities of London  Westminster who we speak to believe this strongly Remain constituency should not be represented in Parliament by the party of Leave – we will work hard to change that. Mr Umunna added: “I will be sad to end my time as the Member of Parliament for Streatham but in Helen Thompson, Streatham Liberal Democrats already had an excellent and incredibly hard-working parliamentary candidate when I joined the party. Helen lives in the community and works at an NGO that provides lesaving aid to people in places such as Yemen and Syria.She led a European Election campaign in the constituency this year which the Liberal Democrats won comfortably. Thanks to her leadership Streatham is now a key target seat for the Liberal Democrats at the next election. I have no doubt Helen can win Streatham for the Liberal Democrats and,elected, she will be an excellent local MP.” When Mr Field apologised for his attack on the protester he said he had grabbed her so violently because he believed she could be armed.

Hundreds of grief-stricken mourners brought streets to a standstill yesterday as they paid a final farewell to Shane Thomas. Among the other floral tributes honouring the -year-old were bottles of Jack Daniels and Grey Goose vodka, boxing rings and a giant boxer.Shane died when the van he was travelling in hit a parked car in Pontypool on August , reports Wales Online.Ahead of his funeral, family and friends lined the streets as his ornate white and blue coffin coffin was carried by a horse-drawn carriage to the church.    The whole procession was expected to last around five hours and conclude at around pm. The two white horses had a plume of sky blue feathers between their ears and blue cloth draped from their flanks.    Mourners, some dressed in dark jeans and bright white T-shirts emblazoned with the words: Rest In Peace Shane, simply the best, gathered round to welcome the cortege. An image of Shane, in a victorious boxing pose, was also printed on their backs. Six silver cars, each one carrying two flags depicting Shaneaposs face, pulled up behind the carriage and family members got out.    All wore crisp white shirts and an item of sky blue, scarves for the women, ties for the men. There was total silence as a red carpet was rolled out from the church doorway as the coffin was carried inside flanked by five men each side. Six pick up trucks waited on the pavement with colourful tributes on the back.  Flowers in all shapes and sizes depicted some of the things Shane was best known for, including a le sized boxer, bedecked in red shorts, his arms held aloft in victory. Family and friends wrote moving tributes to accompany the flowers, which were formed into tributes including a McDonaldaposs meal, complete with fries, a bottle of Jack Daniels and coke, boxing belts, a weights bench and a barbell, a pool table and even bright orange chainsaws. Shane worked in tree services and a company van completed the line of pick ups.  The brief service at Pontymoile Undenominational Christian Mission began at around .pm and was conducted by reverend John Funnell from Noddfa Church, Abersychan. Mourners, who had started filing into the church at am, listened to the welcome, prayers and a time of reflection before singing the only hymn, Amazing Grace. After the eulogy and final prayers, the service ended at .pm and mourners began a slow procession onto the main road. A second service was held at the gym where Shane trained.  The coffin, with the words aposa legend never diesapos stenciled on its side, made its way back down Clarence Road, pulled by the two white horses. Almost , people had gathered for the funeral and they joined the procession in their own vehicles. Officers from Gwent Police went on ahead to close the road and manage traffic. In the days after the fatal crash, friends and family from all over the country placed balloons and flowers on the ground to create a beautul and moving tribute to the young man.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA British ex-headteacher who is due to die at Dignitas today has made a final plea for people in his situation to be able to end their lives at home. Richard Selley, from Perth in Scotland, was diagnosed with motor neurone diseasein , and can no longer walk, talk or swallow. The -year-old has now flown to Zurich in Switzerland with we Elaine and brother Peter, where he has paid around £, to end his le in a matter of hours. He says he was quoted a price in excess of a thousand pounds to have my ashes sent back by courier so has asked his daughter Lorna to pop me in her handbag when she next flies back to Scotland. As his le comes to an end, he is urging for the law to be changed and although it would be too late for him, it would enable other terminally ill people to die peacefully.  In a final video message before his planned death, Richard, the former head of Loretto junior school in East Lothian, called on MSPs to support an assisted dying Bill. He said: I hope that members of the Scottish Parliament support an assisted dying Bill in the future. I think the momentum for a change in the law is growing. It will be too late for me, but I hope that sometime soon people in my position will have the choice to have a peaceful death at a time of their choosing.  He added: Since my diagnosis with MND four years ago, I have lost the ability to walk, talk and swallow. I have also lost most of the power in my arms. Despite these losses I have tried very hard to remain positive and my palliative care has been outstanding. However, as I enter the final stage of my journey, I donapost wish to suffer for much longer so I am seeking an assisted death with Dignitas. Despite what some people think, Dignitas do not let people simply fly to Zurich, knock on their door and ask to die. I have already had to compose letters, write a le story and obtain medical records that prove that I am terminally ill.  This has been stressful, particularly as my GP was advised to refuse my request for an up-to-date medical report. He said the cost attending of the clinic in Switzerland is about £, which he is fortunate he can afford, as others cannot. Having to be able to fly means that I am choosing to die earlier than I would prefer, he added. If an assisted death was possible in Scotland, I would be able to die at a time of my choosing, at home.  Holyrood has twice considered Bills aimed at introducing assisted suicide, with these having brought forward by independent MSP Margo MacDonald and, following her death from Parkinsonaposs disease, Green MSP Patrick Harvie. However, these both failed to get enough support to proceed through the Scottish Parliament. Sarah Wootton, chief executive of the campaign group Dignity In Dying, which released Richardaposs video, said: Richard and his we Elaine have shown immense bravery and dignity in sharing their story and speaking out about the injustice they have both suffered under the UKaposs outdated, broken law in their final weeks together.  She added: If we are serious about improving end of le care in this country and ensuring that everyone has the death thataposs right for them, assisted dying must be part of the conversation. Gordon Macdonald, chief executive of campaign group Care Not Killing, said it is sad Richardaposs case is being used to try and justy a campaign that will rip up long held universal protections, by treating those who are terminally ill, disabled, or have chronic conditions dferently in law. He added: Such a change in the law will put vulnerable people at risk of abuse and of coming under pressure to end their lives prematurely.

Diana Higman was complaining of fatigue at her GP surgery before the harrowing diagnosis. But now  years on she has told how a total stranger saved her le. The single mum was working as a trainee nurse when the tiredness began. After the death of her dad, doctors put her exhaustion down to stress, but sent for blood tests to rule out anything serious, Derbyshire Live reports. The -year-old said: It was nearly  years ago I became ill. I was doing my nurse training and my dad had died not long before. I was really tired but the doctor put it down to stress.    It was recommended that I have some blood tests and I left them for a while but one day I was on placement at the hospital and I popped down to have it done. Next thing I know, I was being put on a super urgent transplant list and was given  hours to live. Diana was diagnosed with auto immune hepatitis and was in desperate need of a new liver, as hers was shrinking rapidly. She said: I was transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham for a liver transplant which I was not expecting. I was so scared, miles away from home and all alone. They came Friday and said we have a liver, but after tests later that day they said it was too big and wouldn’t fit. They put me on a list which searches all over the UK for an organ. This was a very scary time as they said my liver would only last a couple of days. The next day Diana was told another organ was ready for her, but her spirits were low.    She said: I didn’t really get too optimistic then as I realised that someone was losing their le for me to live. It messes with your head big time, but due to toxins in my brain from my liver not working properly, this didn’t really hit me fully apostill after the operation. They came and said we going to harvest your liver which is a horrible way of explaining it. Diana, who lives in Derby, said the transplant took more than a year to get over and she could not walk or even open a bottle of milk after the operation.

Subsequent campaigns have continued to be influenced by people and music, alongside a respect for traditional manufacturing techniques.The generations of women in his family who worked in jute mills in Dundee helped inspire his Juteopolis Spring Summer  collection, which involved a collaboration with the city’s historic fabric mill Halley Stevensons.His Blackwatch Autumn Winter  collection involved researching the complex global story of tartan and the le of George Rose, a Sergeant in the Black Watch regiment who was born a slave. A new kilt for the collection was developed in partnership with Glenisla Kilts of Lanarkshire.Nicholas Daley said: “This exhibition for me is a celebration of my personal history, my family connections to Scotland and Dundee and of the manufactures based here. It reflects what happens in my studio and the processes I go through when researching and creating a new collection.“Most of the women on my mother’s side worked in Dundee jute mills and on father’s side came over to London from Jamaica in the s, bringing with them a certain style.“My parents started a reggae club because they felt at that time in Scotland there wasn’t a space for that type of music. In a way, with my fashion shows and with this exhibition, I’m carrying on that family legacy.”Mhairi Maxwell, VA Dundee project curator, said: “It’s been thrilling to work with Nicholas on this exhibition and to capture the energy of his studio here in Dundee, a city that has had such a big impact on his work.“Nicholas’s honest and playful re-working of tweeds, jutes and tartan express a creative response to identity, belonging and authenticity. These are topics of wide concern in international fashion today and are something that I hope everyone will connect with.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d63e2fec534c2.18919648-406x564.jpg ","title":"bard of salford john cooper clarke promises a right good night in dundee visit","story":"John Cooper Clarke is ready to rock# and Dundee should be afraid, very afraid.He may be in his older years, but he is not holding back.And the man known as the punk poet has vowed to perform in his unmistakable style – machine gun delivery studded with factory floor language.The rasping Salford accent is still there and the humour as cutting as a surgeon’s scalpel.And for the real devotees, John has teased them by telling the Tele exclusively that he has begun planning his memoirs.In typical fashion he says: “I haven’t kept a f****** diary, but I have got a good memory.“In fact, my memory is long and my vengeance is total.”To the musicians and celebs who have crossed JCC in the past, start praying now because the master could even recall the gig I saw him perform at Strathclyde University in the early s and who was playing on the same bill.For the record, it was Siouxsie and the Banshees – and I couldn’t remember that, despite being a few years younger than the man.Back in the day, John easily recalls everyone being angry young men and women. The hate for Thatcher was pure and the depth of feeling surged through concerts and rallies.He says with a chuckle: “Them were the days.“We thought it was bad then, but everything can get worse, as we see now. It’s a case of careful what you wish for.“I don’t get involved in politics now, like I say when didn’t anyone complain about politicians “Can you point me to a golden era where# everybody liked being ruled  F***ing never!“But there are some real creeps nowadays. But then again I expect the worst from any politician.”So what can fans in Dundee expect when John rolls into town for his show at the city’s Gardyne Theatre on Saturday October  Without missing a beat he fires back: “A right f****** good night!“And they can expect more of the same#and then some. There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate. Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now. It’s called ‘The Luckiest Man Alive’ and I’m also working on the memoirs. vw, px\"  “I am thinking of calling that ‘I Wanna Be Yours’ after the Arctic Monkeys. I just hope to live long enough to finish it.“But I am not finishing up any time soon. I have never even thought about that. I am not retiring, not yet and not in the foreseeable future.”John has the tour to contend with first and is also lining up some television work.And at the age of  there is definitely no holding him back. So look out for many more tours to come from the man who wants to be yours."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d654f01808b53.92042964.jpg ","title":"dundee united expected to make changes to starting line up against arbroath","story":"Dundee United will make changes from their triumphant derby line-up for tomorrow’s Tunnock’s Caramel Wafer Challenge Cup clash with Arbroath at Tannadice.However, there will still be plenty experience in the Tangerines’ line-up and the mission will be the unchanged from recent league outings – to come away with a victory.In the past couple of seasons United have used this competition to give many of their youth squad experience of top-team action.While, however, several of their usual league starters will be given a day off tomorrow, the selection for this third-round tie will come from the first-team squad.That means the likes of back-up goalie Deniz Mehmet and attacker Cammy Smith, who’ve spent most of their time on the bench during the first month-and-a-half of the season, are expecting to be handed starting places.“There are a few bumps and bruises from last Friday night so we will be cautious on that,” said assistant boss Gordon Forrest.“As it gets later in the week, we’re getting a clearer picture over possible changes but we will go into the game focused.”The management team are also well aware this is a chance to keep fringe players match fit and reward some of them who’ve been working hard in training despite being out of the team right now.“We have a large squad that we want to try to look at. We want to keep pushing people forward to provide competition,” added Forrest.“Guys who haven’t been playing have been fantastic when they come off the bench.“Nicky Clark has been starting but came off the bench last week and was excellent while Cammy Smith came on, scored and had another chance. Ian Harkes also came on and performed, so it is great.“They have to keep that hunger and desire, those levels up. They have been working really hard and deserve to play but it has been dficult because the other lads have been performing to a high level.“We need players pushing each other and we need the competition for places. We have the trust in the players that we can stick them in there and they can do a job.“It is fantastic for a management staff to have these kind of options. That is a big part of winning week-by-week and winning championships.”United are expected to be without central defender Mark Connolly after he limped out of last week’s derby with a recurrence of the hamstring problem that’s troubled him in recent weeks.It’s not yet clearthe Irishman will be OK for next week’s Championship trip to Ayr United.Star striker Lawrence Shankland was also limping when he came off against Dundee and, while that was just cramp, he may be rested for the Red Lichties clash tomorrow.If the Terrors see off Arbroath they will go into the draw for the last  of the competition, which they won in .Those fourth-round ties will take place on the weekend of October  ."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d679612509057.11323954-842x564.jpg ","title":"exclusive plans for flagship five star hotel at city quay no longer going ahead","story":"Long-running plans to create a flagship five-star hotel in Dundee City Centre lie in tatters after operators decided against developing the property, the Tele can exclusively reveal.Apex Hotels originally announced plans to renovate the Custom House building on East Dock Street into a boutique hotel back in .At the same time, the group announced it would renovate its existing property, Apex Hotel City Quay and Spa, which sits adjacent to Custom House.But Apex has now confirmed that planned work will not go ahead after they pulled the plug and decided to sell the Custom House.A spokesman for the hotel chain said: “Having carried out a full market assessment that looked into the future plans of Custom House and considered ious options, we have taken the decision to sell the property.“With the number of hotels increasing within the area and having already invested heavily in our Dundee property with a £. million upgrade, now is not the time to develop Custom House and bring more accommodation to the market.“We will continue to invest signicantly in Apex City Quay Hotel  Spa, with a £ million programme of works to refurbish our front of house getting under way in the coming weeks.”Previous management at the hotel raised concerns that the Foxlake aqua park directly outside of Athe Apex could have a detrimental impact on bookings.The aqua park has gone from strength to strength and offers wakeboarding and paddle- boarding as well as sessions on its inflatable assault course.Since plans to construct the VA were announced in , there has been a signicant surge in the number of hotels built across the city.Hampton by Hilton, Hotel Indigo, an expanded Premier Inn and Sleeperz above the rail station have all opened within a -minute walk of the museum.But city development convener, Alan Ross, has insisted he is not concerned by the amount of accommodation for visitors in the city centre and said: “This decision has been made solely by the Apex for its own reasons. vw, px\"  “I’m not worried about the number of hotels operating in Dundee.“We identied the number of beds required by the city some time ago. I’ve spoken to management at the Sleeperz hotel above the railway station who said they would welcome another hotel in Dundee.”The area around Custom House has been a hot spot for property developers in recent years.Construction firm#s McGill and Cater Homes plan to redevelop the former DWP building on the corner of Gellatly Street and East Dock Street to create  new homes.Meanwhile, a former warehouse at the bottom of Trades Lane could be demolished to make way for  properties, including three penthouse flats and three retail units on the ground floor. The adjacent Maritime House, which was once the home of travel firm DPL, is being converted into  new flats.No concrete plans for Custom House will be on the table until a new buyer for the property is found.However, the building could appeal to a property developer looking to create more homes in the area, rather than a rival hotelier."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d70de618ba320.45355383-848x564.jpg ","title":"kobee good place for a meat lover and a handy location on the waterfront if a little pricy","story":"Driving into Dundee off the bridge I couldn’t help but look at Kobee’s shiny, glassy exterior and think “I haven’t been there in a while”.Sadly, the place no longer does teppanyaki with the chef cooking it in front of you and calling you names – an experience I’d enjoyed on my previous visit when celebrating my future we’s birthday, despite her surviving having food chucked into her hat without getting egg on her face.I didn’t think I would miss being called “sexy boy” by the chef as I ordered my dinner but I guess I did#It is, though, still a place to enjoy some good meat, evenyou can’t say it’s the cheapest place in town – a once-in-a-while choice for those living on a budget.Eating on a Monday night, getting a table wasn’t a hassle and we even managed to get plonked down next to the window to watch Dundee le passing by.The excitement and wonder of the teppanyaki show disappearing was a disappointment when we recalled how much we’d enjoyed it.However, we resolved to make our own fun and had an enjoyable night out on the town.The first order was to get the drinks in – a pint of Pravha for meand a ml helping of Malbec for my we .Then it was on to figuring out which of the mouth-watering options we were going to opt for from the Teppan grill.Eventually I made my choice of Surf and Turfwith Angus sirloin and king prawn in either spicy or teriyaki sauce.A solid choice, I thought, and one I would stick to no matter what.Well, for a couple of minutes anyway.My partner made the same choice and couldn’t understand why us having the same meal would make for a rubbish review.So I changed to Kobee Delightwhich gives duck breast with Angus sirloin for a couple of bob extra with spicy sauce rather than the honey option.I do love duck so I couldn’t claim it as much of a hardship, despite doing just that to justy stealing prawns from across the table.On the side we added salt and pepper chipsto share between us.For a place that prides itself on the quality of its meat the food was just fine – but I couldn’t help having a tinge of disappointment along with it.Harking back to my previous meal there probably isn’t fair but it was a memorable night, not just because of the chef’s antics but the incredible quality of the prawns and steak that night.This just didn’t live up to that high standard, though it was good in its own right.The duck was lovely and the steak just fine, with the spicy sauce not too bad on the hotness.It was an enjoyable meal, only spoiled by my own previous experience.My we’s choice went down just the same, too, with the teriyaki-covered prawns sweet and tasty.There was still time for me to watch her down some ice cream to finish, too– I’m not much of a puddings man when there’s no sticky toffee option.Overall it’s a decent meal and an enjoyable one but, for the prices charged, decent won’t have me back too soon eventhe new chef calls me “sexy##"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"oscar-marzaroli-images-past-glasgow-life","story":"Kneeling in front of the old John Smithrsquos bookshop in Glasgowrsquos St Vincent Street is a boy.

Front line staff are working hard to provide care in very dficult circumstances, but care in the community can only workproperly resourced by senior management.It is hard to avoid the conclusion that many of the decisions to sht care away from centres such as hospitals are as much to do with saving money as the genuine best interest of patients.In times of recession it is, once again, the most vulnerable in society who bear the brunt.The rain is teeming down as this is being written, but last weekend saw sunshine and crowds in Tarbert.The atmosphere was fantastic for the seafood festival, and there is no doubt the weather helped in a big way.Congratulations to the small band of organisers for another great weekend."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column august 9 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe Egg Shed opening is big news for Mid Argyll.The development, as part of the wider Ardrishaig harbour improvements, can only be a good thing for the village.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"red star take derby spoils","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRed Star welcomed local rivals Tarbert to the joint campus, and it was the Lochgilphead side who maintained their place at the top of the group thanks to a Stuart MacLean goal early in the second half.The first half of the game on Saturday August  began at a typically fast pace as you might expect from a derby clash-  but both sides were limited to efforts from long range which goalkeepers John Martin and Ally Lewis dealt with relative ease.The home side started to enjoy more possession as the first half progressed but were finding the well-organised Tarbert defence dficult to breach and were limited to efforts from distance which failed to trouble Martin in the Dookers goal.Star came out quicker at the start of the second half and looked to play at a much higher tempo. The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"easy like summer busking","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe music club designed for everyone continues its summer of busking on Wednesday August .Get along to Lochgilphead Resource Centre for an evening of music from the much-missed Danny Kennedy with bagpipes, percussion and plenty of chances to sing along to the music.The event starts at pm and is free other than donations.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"macalister wins tarbert golf championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe delayed fourth and final round of the Tarbert Golf Club championship took place at Glenralloch on Saturday August  in glorious conditions.The greens were freshly cut with captain Smyth choosing some interesting pin positions to test the players# skills.Iain Macalister held a one shot lead over Bruce MacNab and a five shot lead over John MacNab heading into the final round.If there were any nerves at the start of play this was not evident as Iain started with four fours then followed that with an excellent -foot birdie putt at the fth and a chip-in birdie at the sixth.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day.

The overall revenue budget for the upkeep of parks across the Borders is contained within the budget for neighbourhood services and no savings are projected from this budget as a result of the play programme.ldquoThe removal of old play equipment from playparks, which following appraisal, deemedto be low value facilities, will allow for sufficient resources to be deployed to maintain thenew facilities being invested in by the council through the outdoor community spacescapital project on an ongoing basis.ldquoThe new facilities include more pieces of equipment, widening access and providinghigher play value than the previous, aged, low-amenity, play equipment.

She would think nothing of taking home patientsrsquo pot plants to look afterthey were going on holiday, and once arrived back at Lindean with a pair of dachshunds for the same reason.Born in Troon, Ayrshire, on November , , Helen was the daughter of John and Helen Baxter. At that time her father was employed as an English teacher at Marr College, later transferring to the village school of Scotlandwell in Perth  Kinross.The family moved to the Borders when Mr Baxter took up the post of schoolmaster at Bowden School, eventually rising to become Director of Education for Roxburghshire County Council.The family set up home at Lindean, with Helenrsquos brother Sandy later taking over the running of Lindean Farm. Both siblings attended Lindean School, before moving to Selkirk High School.Helen undertook her basic nursing training at Edinburghrsquos Dean College, then studied for her midwery qualication at Bellshill Maternity Hospital, Glasgow.

Not only are volunteers providing fresh food for locals, they are also regenerating unused spaces, transforming them into lush green patches for all to feast upon. When filming wrapped, reporter Hilary Scott caught up with community gardeners Adam Skelton and Shirley Spence, to ask them how their gardens grow.THE High Street is the heart of the bustling town of Peebles.A derelict bit of land behind the former court building has been transformed into a tranquil greenspace and is now the Courthouse Community Garden.Adam Skelton told the Peeblesshire News: ldquoDuring the filming we discussed Borders Food Community Facebook Group which is a popular place for people to share food, plants, seeds, tools, and materials, as well as advice and information related to food growing, preparing, cooking and storing.ldquoAnyone can join the group free and there you can connect with lots of knowledgeable and very helpful grower, composters, cooks, preservers, picklers. The list goes on.ldquoWe also discussed land sharing. Various group members have allowed us to share their land and create group food gardens.And the Courthouse Community Garden is one of those havens.ldquoIt was an unused overgrown patch of land and we have converted it into a very productive little garden, explained Adam.ldquoThere is no contract or rent and we have not received any funding.The creation of this garden is down to the hard work of green-fingered volunteers and waste products, which Adam says is a ldquowin-win for all involved.He added: ldquoThe land owners get their land tended and access to free fresh food on their doorstep and we get to grow as we wish in this lovely space.Despite the success of Borders Food Community, Adam says he finds it odd that the vast majority of people are not eating truly local food when there are so many benefits.ldquoFor example therersquos the environment. There is no packaging or food miles, itrsquos so much tastier when fresh and all the nutrients intact and its better for local economy.Adam is very passionate about the work of community gardens and is encouraging locals to join Borders Food Community Facebook Group where they can discover their nearest community garden and get involved.The ITV crew headed to Innerleithen in the afternoon to discover a garden maintained by little and large green-fingers.Volunteers from community gardens across the Borders gathered at the Edible Garden along with St Ronanrsquos Primary School pupils.ldquoEveryone who wanted to got the chance to say a few words. It was great to have people from all the community gardens together in one place discussing more ways to collaborate together to further promote local food growing across the Borders, said Adam.The Edible Garden team were delighted to host the ITV Border Le crew.Shirley Spence said: ldquoWe enjoyed meeting the dferent groups of community growers and making new contacts. We were pleased with the comments and feedback about our garden and learning about other community gardens and their work in the Borders.And the children from St Ronanrsquos Primary School also

Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

When the corn was eventually gathered in early September, it is said decaying corpses were discovered. They had lain in the fields since August , a day of barbaric infamy in Tranentrsquos history. The dead were victims of the Tranent Massacre, and one of the bodies may have been that of Jackie Crookston or Crookstone.I say lsquomayrsquo for there is ironically so little known about this well-known woman. A statue by David Annand of Jackie on Tranent High Street shows her beating her drum with a clenched fist, defiantly leading the protest against the Militia Act. The plaque by the statue calls her a ldquoresolute woman who joined the protest, and states she was one of those killed by the cavalry.Her heroic reputation is well established in local lore. The th-century historian John Martine called her ldquoa Tranent virago. This word describes a woman of brave, fearless qualities, but it has a sting in its tail. It can also be used to mean a woman who has overstepped her mark, broken cultural rules in relation to her role as defined by gender.And by leading the protest against the Militia Act she most certainly did this.Another th-century historian and collector of traditions, P. MrsquoNeill, was clear on her role: ldquoJackie indeed was the prime mover in the whole affair, he states.We have accounts of her beating her drum and leading the protest with chants of ldquonae militia. She is said to have threatened a captain of the cavalry and declared defiantly that ldquoshe didna care a pin though she were cut in halves, she wad hae nae militia. Another account has her telling a member of the yeomanry to leave or she would ldquothraw his neck, at which he duly rode off.If these accounts are true, she was indeed resolute on that day in defending her family, her neighbours and her community. Jackie was not the only woman on the streets that day, for women took a leading role in defending their families. But she was the most prominent, it seems.The Militia Act aimed to conscript young men into a militia by means of a ballot. It was resisted for a number of reasons, but for the poverty-stricken mining and farming communities of Tranent and the surrounding area, it was seen as an imposition which would take young men of working age away and potentially cripple their families economically.There is no space here to recount the details of the massacre, but much of what happened on that day remains hidden behind a mist of cover-up and official indference.And somewhere in the bloody carnage of August , , Jackie Crookston was killed, along with many others. Yet despite her leading role, her name was not included in the original list of people killed. Eleven deaths were recorded, but no mention of Jackie. ldquoHow her death escaped recording is dficult to explain, reflected P. MrsquoNeill in his book Tranent and its Surroundings.Perhaps an explanation can be found in an eyewitness account written immediately after the massacre. It was a letter from Archibald Roger to his we in Edinburgh.It begins: ldquoDear we, this comes to acquaint you that you need not weary for my ing home, for my sister is to be buried this afternoon at four orsquoclock, and I cannot come away till I see her decently interred. I am sorry to inform you of the cruelties that were committed here yesterday there were six persons shot dead on the spot, of which my sister was onehellip the number of wounded is not yet ascertained, but I am just now informed that  dead corpses were this morning found in the corn-fields and it is not known how many more may be found when the corn is cut.Was Jackie one of those lying undiscovered in a field  It seems so by some accounts. Is that why her death was not on the list  Sandy Mullay in his book The Tranent Massacre says she was shot in the streets, but there is also a tradition which states her body was found well away from Tranent much later in a field, with stab as well as gunshot wounds.Was she initially wounded and then a victim of later retribution  Was she hunted down in an unrecorded atrocity because of her role as ring leader, and a woman who didnrsquot know her place  She will have been easy to identy because of her prominence in the protest.Her death, just like her le, is unrecorded by history. Despite her leadership in the events, she was a woman and she was poor, and history lacks interest in such characters. A tax on the registration of births and deaths at this time meant many poor people lived and died unregistered even in parish records.So who was Jackie  We know she was born in Gladsmuir in June  and was a mother. Perhaps not all her children were registered because of the tax, but it seems she had at least four surviving at the time of the massacre. She was only  when she died, but how do we imagine her le  What was behind her passion in defending her community When I spoke of her to artist Mags Nisbet-Macfarlane, she was inspired to use art to search for the woman behind the historical glimpses.ldquoI felt connected to this woman I did not know, she told me, ldquoshe will have had a le that explains her defiance that day she had so little, but was protecting what was important to her. Magsrsquo image of Jackie tells a story without the need of words.The plaque by the statue in Tranent says there were  killed in the massacre, as Jackiersquos name has been added to the original . But in truth we will never know for sure how many were really killed and maimed that day.There was no prosecution of those responsible, no investigation and no interest by those in authority to allow the truth to be told."},{"url":null,"title":"new-dunbar-area-radio-station-hunt-volunteers","story":"Sescot Radio, previously known as Dunbar On Air, is looking to take to the airwaves and have the community at the heart of its programmes.Andrew Morris, who is behind the proposals, was keen to get people involved, whether that was on air or behind the scenes.He told the Courier: ldquoFirst of all, we are an internet radio station so our catchment area is all around the world.ldquoBut, from a common sense point of view, there is no physical radio covering from East Linton and Dunbar right down the coast to Burnmouth and along to Kelso wersquove got a triangle.ldquoIrsquom keen that these little places that have got two or three cottages are just as involved.ldquoWhat we are doing is covering Eyemouth, Dunbar and Kelso but we donrsquot want to preclude these folk either.ldquoWe want to involve everybody and preclude nobody.Already, the fledgling station has been out in the community and got involved with Dunbar Civic Week earlier this summer.Mr Morris was keen to see the radio station cater to as large an audience as possible.The -year-old was previously involved with both East Coast FM in Haddington and Tranent-based East Lothian FM, which is now Radio Saltire.He told the Courier that he had interviewed a number of East Lothian councillors on air but the focus was firmly away from politics and instead looked at a number of dferent topics.That was something he was keen to consider repeating, with other shows looking at ious genres of music, as well as cooking shows.As well as music, the station would promote local good causes and encourage involvement from schools, charities, clubs and other organisations.Now, Mr Morris, who lives on Dunbarrsquos John Muir Crescent, is calling on members of the public to come forward and offer a helping hand to get the station off the ground.A meeting takes place at Hallhill Sports Centre in Dunbar on Wednesday evening.Mr Morris said: ldquoWe are progressing but a lot slower than I hoped.ldquoWe have got ious applications out for grant money and have been awarded some but we need a lot more before we think about buying the gear that we need.ldquoWe are also anxious to find some suitable premises.In-house training will be provided at the station, which will be run entirely by volunteers.The station also intends to offer work experience opportunities for those looking to find their way into a career in the media.The meeting takes place at pm, when members of the public will be updated on the stationrsquos progress."},{"url":null,"title":"up-and-coming-band-go-first-scottish-tour","story":"Johnny Brown and the Devanties, made up of frontman Johnny Brown, , Erin Ritchie, , Andrew Dobie, , and Struan Blacklock, , will be heading to Aberdeen at the start of next month on the first gig of their headline tour.Johnny told the Courier: ldquoIrsquove been singing and writing music since I was about  years old.ldquoI knew the tour manager for The View so ended up playing a few gigs with them.ldquoIrsquove played the EH festival and once I had the chance to play with Republica.ldquoIn January I reconnected with a few people I went to school with through the music scene and we decided to form the band.ldquoWersquove released one single and our next one, Streetlights, will be released after the tour.Johnny of Edinburgh Road, Cockenzie, met his fellow bandmates while at Preston Lodge High School.He said: ldquoWe had to make sure that we were able to sell out shows before we knew we could tour.ldquoWe sold out about seven gigs in a row, so thatrsquos when we thought we should give it a go.The bandrsquos first single, Brooklyn, was released just after they were first formed in January and garnered good reviews, in particular from Discover Music, Scotlandrsquos Music Blog.As to the future, Johnny said: ldquoWersquore hoping our tour and our new single will do really well, hopefully itrsquoll help us break through.

So the teammade a conscious decision to use all the meat from the carcase, specically the prime cuts, in thesausages and burgers and it has made a huge dference to the taste and succulence of the product. Why not have an everyday product with the best ingredients The pork meat is available all year round giving customers a steady supply of their staple shopping and this is then boosted with seasonal lamb, game and beef. When theygo to the markets people just love the story of the farm and that theycan basically point to the field where the animals are being reared.The flavours and dferent products have been created in collaboration with thelocal butcher and theirrange of wild venison is sourced from local estates, shot by a member of the Scottish Deer Society.Springfield Game and Country Meatsare looking to develop flavours without detracting from the flavour of the meat and product, you donrsquot need to hide quality. Theyare both genuinely surprised about how quickly the brand has taken off and how popular the products have become. Theyhave already managed to create links with local restaurants who are happy to promote local food producers andwere a finalist for best Artisan Food producer at the Scottish Rural Awards , which has been a welcome jolt of recognition.www.springfieldmeatsFACEBOOK @springfieldcountrymeats"},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Why the Opposition wants to stop the coup     and stop the election","story":"Oh no! Wersquore not falling for that trick ndash no way Jose. Asking for an election was just Boris Johnson trying to use democracy to get off the hook, said Labour and the LibDems.Jeremy Corbyn may have spent the last two years demanding ldquoa General Election now, but he didnrsquot actually mean ldquonow, according to Labourrsquos Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, Tony Lloyd, on Newsnight. He meant: ldquoonly when the Opposition parties choose it. They want to stop No Deal first by mandating the Government to ask for an extension of Article .:Brexit: Boris Johnson to seek election after Commons defeatNow, the original objection to the election, as with the prorogation, was the threat that Mr Johnson might cunningly schedule the campaign to last beyond Brexit day, on October , thus forcing the UK out when Parliament is not sitting. That would have been outrageous. But even the offer of an election on October  ndash two and a half weeks before Britain is set to leave ndash seems to be unacceptable to Labour or the Tory rebels. Or at least most of them. There were many contradictory statements yesterday, as Parliament went into meltdown.You can understand why many Labour MPs might want to delay an election. A lot of them would lose their seats for a start. Mr Corbyn is thought to be a closet Brexiter, so maybe he doesnrsquot want to risk the possibility that Labour might actually win, leaving him with the poisoned chalice of Brexit.All Opposition MPs relish the prospect of Mr Johnson, who said he would leave the EU on October  ldquodo or die, being forced to go cap in hand to Brussels to ask for yet another extension to Article , as ordered by the Extension Bill. Butthe Tory rebels stay strong today, and the bill becomes law, could Parliament really order the Prime Minister to do something he has repeatedly promised not to do Outside Downing Street on Monday, Mr Johnson said there were ldquono circumstances in which he would ask Brussels for a delay. But it would be the law of the land, chorus MPs and commentators. He would just have to do what hersquos told by Parliament. But it isnrsquot quite as easy as that. You can take the PM to water, but can you make him drink He could refuse to give the Extension Bill what is called ldquoQueenrsquos Consent, because it interferes with royal prerogative ndash the right of governments to conduct foreign affairs, and sign treaties. This has been used by Prime Ministers before, Labour included.The similar Cooper-Letwin Bill, last March, didnrsquot require Queenrsquos Consent because Theresa May accepted it. Indeed, she went ahead and requested the extension of Article  before the bill had finished going through Parliament. She wanted an extension to avoid no deal. Mr Johnson doesnrsquot, so he could refuse to let it become law.Alternatively, he might just note the Extension Act, and then noty Brussels that,the EU  agree to an extension, he will not cooperate. He could just empty-chair the whole process, as he did the TV debates during his leadership election. Or he could attach unacceptable conditions over budget contributions. The European Union does not negotiate with inidual MPs or with parliaments ndash it negotiates with the governments of member states. Would the  EU countries agree to extend British membership under such a recalcitrant, delinquent PM Mr Johnson would argue that the constitution is on his side. If the Commons keeps him in office, and by not supporting a confidence motion, it would be reaffirming him as the Prime Minister, then he has to act according to Government policies. This would be an absurd situation of course. A demeaning spectacle.:What the papers say about Boris Johnson and BrexitIn times past, when a PM lost on a key plank of government policy, he or she would simply resign and call an election. This was what James Callaghan did after he was defeated in . But because of the Fixed Term Parliament Act ndash passed by the Cameron coalition in  without thinking through the consequences ndash the Prime Minister cannot actually call an election. Mr Johnson has to win a two-thirds majority in the Commons.Labour appears to be saying that it would vote to keep him, pro tem. It wants the Extension Bill to be law before there is an election, to prevent Britain crashing out of the EU at the end of October. But the idea of a Prime Minister being forced to act, as it were, by an alternative government based in Parliament, is not something our constitution can handle. The Westminster system is based on the assumption thata government has no majority for its actions, it ceases to be it is a dead parrot. The Fixed Term Act allows the Opposition parties effectively to hold the Prime Minister hostage.The matter will probably end up in the courts. Remain groups already have their legal teams working against the prorogation and will roll that into an action claiming that the government is acting unlawfully. Willy nilly, democracy is moving from Parliament to the judges benches. Irsquom not sure this is a good thing.Whatever happens this week, there will have to be an election soon. It could destroy both the main parties. Indeed, after ex-Chancellor Philip Hammondrsquos claim that the Tory Party is being taken over by ldquoentryists itrsquos questionable whether the Conservative Party still exists. Conservative MPs are crossing the floor, like Phillip Lee, or leaving like Justine Greening.:Andrew McKie: Contradictions at heart of SNPs Brexit election strategyLabour isnrsquot in much better shape. It is hopelessly confused over Brexit, still apparently committed to negotiating another deal with Brussels before putting it to a referendum. In Scotland the party is facing virtual extinction.Perhaps thatrsquos why the prospect of a General Election before Brexit Day has become somewhat unattractive. As Oscar Wilde said, therersquos only one thing worse than not getting what you want thatrsquos getting it."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Late it is  indeed  but we can rejoice at this Booker choice","story":"Why the excitement  Well, where to begin  Ellmann, who lives in Edinburgh with her husband Todd McEwen, also a writer, is one of the most undeservedly under-appreciated novelists of our times. In part, this could be because her fiction is risky, challenging, sometimes riotously funny, but as often sizzling with rage. Her titles include Man or Mango , Dot in the Universe, and Mimi, savage satires on gender politics which are nevertheless also filled with tenderness and optimism. Her fondness for emphasising words in capital letters or italics has irked some critics, who prefer the page to look ordered and calm. But since when was fiction a form of beta blocker  With Ellmann, you feel yoursquove had an injection of adrenaline, quickening your heartbeat and bringing the world alive.Compared with her other novels, Ducks, Newburyport takes something of a new turn. As always, a woman is at its heart, but in this instance, instead of a slim work, it is big: just shy of , pages. Told by an Ohio housewe, who bakes her way through the tale, it is a stream-of-consciousness portrait of modern-day America, in all its confusion, consumerism, and cupidity. A y glossary of abbreviations is appended, ranging from Ato ZPGby way of IHPand WMD . You get the picture.Theof the story is ambitious enough, but asshe needed something more to spur her on, Ellmann has written the entire book ndash barring the opening passage ndash in a single sentence. Does this sound intimidating  Probably. Or make the book hard to read  Not at all. It is like stumbling on an oasis in a desert, a refreshing, invigorating, restorative immersion in a piece of remarkable, thoughtful and truly innovative fiction. Too many headline-grabbing novels are dull and predictable, enervating rather than enjoyable, derivative when they should be daring. Such tedious stuff makes you forget that the original meaning of the word novel was something dferent, unique, and new.Thankfully the Booker  has recognised a work of exceptional talent. Its presence on the shortlist adds lustre to a prize that has been dogged over the years by accusations of mediocrity and popularism, charges that last yearrsquos winner, Milkman by Anna Burns, helped to refute. Ellmannrsquos fellow shortlistees are prestigious, including Margaret Atwood and Salman Rushdie, both of whom have won before, along with El Shafak, second only to Orhan Pamuk in Turkey for international acclaim, British writer Bernadine Eisto, and the Nigerian Chigozie Obioma, shortlisted for his second novel, as he was with his first.The competition is stf, but already statistics are being trotted out: were it to win, Ducks, Newburyport would be the longest to prevail in the historyrsquos prize, beating even Eleanor Cattonrsquos doorstopper, The Luminaries, by more than  pages. Apart from their size, however, these two novels are poles apart. There is nothing conventional about Ducks, Newburyport. Indeed, Ellmannrsquos literary credentials can be traced back to James Joyce, the exemplar of stream of consciousness, where the reader has to surrender themselves to the flow, trusting the author to keep their head above water until they reach their destination. In the fluidity of Ellmannrsquos prose therersquos an echo of Henry James, with his sharp and self-conscious interrogation of America. Therersquos a nod to Virginia Woolf too, but Ellmannrsquos wit and acerbity, her scorching political lens, are all her own.The direction her style has taken is perhaps no surprise. Ellmannrsquos late father Richard was a world-renowned expert on Oscar Wilde and Yeats, but above all on James Joyce. His biography of the myopic Dublin genius has never been surpassed, remaining one of the most acclaimed literary biographies of the last century. The linguistic poetry and emotional range of Joyce, who must have been an invisible but constant presence in the Ellmann household, seems to have got under his daughterrsquos skin at a formative age.The announcement of the Booker Prize next month, on October , will mark  years to the day since its only Scottish winner, James Kelman, took the prize in  with How Late It Was, How Late. This was a highly contentious choice, not just because of its interior monologue narration, but also its liberal use of the F-word, which horried one uptight judge. The controversy it sparked has never been forgotten. These days, though, you canrsquot help thinking the title sounds like a lament for the lapse of time between Kelmanrsquos success and that of anyone  living north of the Border.There is no doubting Kelmanrsquos status as one of our finest novelists. Along with Alasdair Gray, he is an obvious contender for a Nobel Prize, though the chances of that idiosyncratic telescopersquos lens turning in this direction seem slim. Unlike many others, winning the Booker did not make Kelman rich or famous. It did, however, raise his profile internationally, and set a benchmark for those keen to add something memorable to the literary cairn.Ducks, Newburyport certainly does that. Other than in their tireless search for a mesmerising and distinctive way of expressing themselves, at first glance there is little obvious common ground between this pair. It is only when you read their books and recognise their seemingly effortless brilliance that you realise how similar, and rare, they are.In the acknowledgements at the end of Ducks, Newburyport, Ellmann thanks ldquoEdinburgh City Council for my Saltire card, a dandy aid to the impecunious. Itrsquos a cheerful reminder that unless yoursquore a bestseller, the literary le is not deluxe. Yet listening to the naturalness of her narratorrsquos voice, and the stories she tells, makes you grateful that the writerrsquos feet are firmly on the ground, be it a New Town pavement, No.  bus, or mid-west America, where the future is unfolding fast."},{"url":null,"title":"brian-beacom-tattoos-cant-cool-even-david-dimbleby-one","story":"The intent was to explore the paradox that while employers feel disdain for tattoos , nearly a third of --year-olds and a fth of the entire population, have been inked, clearly laughing in the face of career prospect.Yet, the research throws up another paradox which isnrsquot mentioned how can those who have a tattoo consider themselves to be ldquoimpulsive, believe they are the type to colour in outside the margins, the stand-out characters who now command attention, when tattoos are as common to Scottish skin as blue legs in winter Snce Robbie Williams and David Beckhamand Amy Winehousesomehow imprinted the notion of skin printing onto the psyche of the nation, itrsquos been impossible not to stand in a queue at Greggs and not see a female with a Polynesian fertility symbol etched onto her arm, or a male in Tesco without a thistle or an Arabic symbol.Roll up a bank managerrsquos sleeve and therersquos likely to be a quote from a Bob Dylan song.

As the child of immigrant parents, I had been brainwashed with the lsquoeducation is everythingrsquo mantra since I was wee. My mother had pretty much mapped out my educational future as she lsquoenjoyedrsquothe two weeks in hospital after my birth. Now, on the verge of my own children starting school, it suddenly hit me that being an Asian Tiger Mum was going to take drive, time and commitment and, worryingly, I was low on all three.I lacked the drive. As a second-generation British Scottish Asian I didnt have the same hunger to see my children succeed that my parents had. I lacked the time. As a TV producer, I worked fairly long, and sometimes irregular, hours which meant I would often just appear at bedtime. And, as for commitment ndash I was that invisible parent whose nanny was presumed to be mummy, even though the skin tones were definitely a puzzle. So, the Asian Tiger Mum of my dream was replaced by a half-arsed, Asian Tabby Mum. . I was also surrounded by laissez-faire, non-Asian, friends who urged me to: ldquoRelax, chill, let them do their own thing, which seeped into my psyche like a dose of Valium.Last weekend, fast-gulping tears as I dropped my younger son at university, I reflected on where it had all gone wrong for Asian Tiger Mum. Sure enough, both boys are at university but neither had achieved what Asian Tiger Mum had hoped. With a mix of As and Bs in their Highers they struggled to get into universities of their choice. In fact, the younger son had had five rejections from universities to study law. This marked the final, humiliating demise of Asian Tiger Mum, as I phoned round universities begging them for any space they might have available in any subject.His last few weeks at home were marred by arguments, sulks and door slamminghellipand not just by him. Dinner times were fractured by heated discussions ndash mainly about politics or what he was going to do with his le ndash that descended into full-blown rammies. I began to resent his youthful, mental agility ndash being able to pull facts from thin air to prove points and his steely determination to be heard and strike the winning riposte at the crucial moment. Asian Tiger Mum would never have countenanced this.So, what happened  Alongside my half-arsedness, there were other factors in the slaying of Asian Tiger Mum. Number one son was diagnosed with a rare condition called Chronic Repetitive Multocal Osteomyelitis , which caused painful lesions. There was stfness in his joints, and awkwardness in his gait. His handwriting was truly shocking, and I worried that examiners might not be able to read it, but I attributed that to the stfness. His Higher results were acceptable, but I could tell by his reaction that he was deflated. Tiger Mum was disappointed too, but priorities had shted, and I was simply relieved that the CRMO was easing. On his th birthday after watching him struggle to cut his birthday cake, I took him to an Occupational Therapist who told us he had Dyspraxia too. Dyspraxia, characterised by a lack of coordination, clumsiness and poor fine motor skills , helped him understand why it had all been a bit of a struggle, and it explained to me why he had refused to take part in sports, play any sort of instrument and struggled at PE.As for the wee one, Asian Tiger Mum was slayed by the sheer force of his personality. A non-compliant child from a young age, this child gleefully worked his way through a whole address book of childminders, until I finally had to leave my job and run a business from home to look after him. A child who, when I confiscated his phone when he was , wilfully gathered  of my mumrsquos old Encyclopaedia Britannicas so he could lsquoread about stuffrsquo because he couldnt get his fix of Wikipedia. This child was not going to let me sit alongside him as he studied, get a tutor or attend any clubs or activities.So, yes, le got in the way of me being the parent I wanted to be, and every once in a while, that irritates me, but then I think lsquoactually itrsquos all relativersquo. And whilst Asian Tiger Mum has been neutralised, shambolic Asian Tabby Mum looks around the empty nest and feels pretty chuffed."},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW  Big Yin takes Manhattan  and the Pilgrim Fathers get a kicking too","story":"ITV, pmOVER the quarter century Billy Connolly has been travelling the world for television the viewer has become accustomed to some astonishing scenes.

Polling this week by You Gov suggests that the Scottish Tories could lose nearly a third of their votes and up to  of their  hard-won Westminster seats when the much-discussed General Election finally comes around.:Boris Johnson suffers devastating blow as brother Jo quitsBut the picture in Scotland is the reverse of what is happening UK-wide, where Boris Johnsonrsquos poll ratings have risen steadily since July. He may be polling only  per cent of the vote but Nigel Farage is open to an electoral pact. With that in place, then thanks to the hopelessly unrepresentative Westminster voting system, Mr Johnson could well win a thumping majority on well below  per cent of the popular vote.This might be fabulous news for the SNP, since Mr Johnson is the most effective recruiting sergeant theyrsquove ever had Sturgeon speeches could not, by pushing support for independence above  per cent.But for the wider rebel alliance seeking to prevent a hard Brexit, it is very challenging indeed. A Johnson win would undo all the unprecedented cross-party effort that has gone into trying to block a no-deal Brexit.The timing of an election has been much discussed, with Opposition parties more or less agreeing that they cannot allow a poll to take place before Boris Johnson has been forced to delay Brexit.But even , prior to the election, Mr Johnson had bowed to the demands of the Extension Bill and asked Brussels for a delay to Brexit , once elected he would most likely steer the country towards no-deal at the end of January instead of October.Of course he might be able to use those three months to negotiate a deal with the EU, but in spite of the Government spin suggesting that a deal is imminent, therersquos been precious little progress so far. Like a lazy child who insists hersquos nearly finished his homework when it lies untouched in his schoolbag, Mr Johnson has come up with nothing concrete yet to replace the Irish backstop, according to the EU, which is still waiting.So what can be done to prevent a hard Brexit  Mr Johnson must be kept out of Downing Street ndash which means Opposition parties forming an electoral pact.:Ian McConnell: No escape from Johnsonrsquos dire Brexit farce in Paris metro and airportNow, Irsquom not saying this will be easy. How, one wonders, do you sit down over tea and biscuits with a bunch of folk yoursquove been loudly slagging off for years  Is it like a school mediation session Perhaps they all have to write down something nice about each other and read it out loud.Itrsquos not easy for politicians of opposing parties to work together, but theyrsquove done it over the Extension Bill, and now they need to do it with the election. The latest poll shows Labour on  per cent, the Lib Dems on  per cent and the Greens on five per cent, UK-wide. Add in a strong showing for the SNP and Plaid Cymru, and an anti-no deal majority is possible ndash but onlythe pro-Remain parties are prepared to work in concert.They did it in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, where the Greens and Plaid Cymru graciously stood aside to help the frontrunner Lib Dems win. Now the Lib Dems, Labour and the SNP must consider similar action.What are the other options  Try to force through a referendum bill  There wasnrsquot enough support for adding a referendum provision to the Extension Bill, so that looks unlikely. Get the Extension Bill through, then hold a no-confidence vote in Mr Johnson in order to create a government of national unity to seek a new deal on dferent terms which could then be put to a referendum  This is an appealing prospect andpoliticians were characters in a childrenrsquos TV drama, then we could trust them to come together like this ldquoin the national interest , but again, it would require trust across tribal lines and a willingness to suffer the brickbats such an arrangement would inevitably trigger. Jo Swinson has said Jeremy Corbyn could not lead such a government, since few Tories would back him, and she may be right, but thatrsquos not to say a compromise candidate couldnrsquot be found.An election, however, remains the most obvious way out of the impasse, so the Opposition parties must be ready.It has felt at times in the past few days asthe plot of a Simon Pegg movie is unfolding at Westminster, one where a crazy sect of androids has taken over the government and is ejecting respectable Tory pensioners onto College Green in the rain, dropping the torn fragments of their Conservative Party membership cards at their feet. The fightback is surely imminent: Irsquom sure wersquod all like to see what Nicholas Soames can do with the parliamentary mace.But in the absence of a septuagenarian revolt, wersquoll have an election to try and put right this mess.

In this he displayed the utter ignorance of and insouciance of the Westminster elite to the reality of le beyond the Watford Gap and the societal changes brought about by years of deliberate austerity. This had compounded the wounds caused by the progressive deindustrialisation of the regions stemming from the time of Margaret Thatcher coupled with the centralisation of wealth and its means of creation in the south-east of England. Not only did Mr Cameron fail to appreciate that he could lose the referendum he had no plans in place to deal with this eventuality.The electorate faced a referendum based on what have subsequently proven to be  promises and non-existent prospectuses. So an internal dispute within one political party which currently only governs because of our archaic ldquofirst past the post electoral system and shady back room deals has been allowed to fracture a country.That we witness daily MPs, some of them Cabinet ministers, drawing lines in the sand only for the incoming tide of promotion and self-advancement to wash them away is revolting. Scottish Conservative MPs voting to support the interests of the party rather than those of the constituents who elected them is simply unsupportable as it is the antithesis of the basis of a representative democracy. The only positive we can take from the whole exercise is that it has clearly demonstrated that we cannot trust our politicians when they put party before country, tell barefaced lies, change their opinions to advance their careers and are willing to shut down Parliament to force a minority view on the country irrespective of the harm it will, not may, cause most of us.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.MUCH will be said in the coming days and weeks about David Mundell, the MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale who was also until recently Scotlandrsquos Secretary of State. As a resident of Dumfries and Galloway I am very aware that both the current Secretary of State Alistair Jack and David Mundell were elected in  to represent the residents of this county.Alistair Jack voted for keeping a No Deal Brexit as an option. Strangely, despite all the independent evidence that it would be disastrous for jobs, livelihoods and prices in the shops, he has always supported the No Deal option. Although he was voting against his constituentsrsquo wishes, at least you knew where you stood with Mr Jack and the voters of Dumfries and Galloway will have the choice at the next election to remove or keep him on as their representative.What about the Right Honourable David Mundell  ldquoRight certainly describes his political leanings but ldquoHonourable  On Tuesday, Mr Mundell voted to support Boris Johnsonrsquos option of a disastrous No Deal exit from the EU. However, in  he agreed with the wishes of his constituentsby saying publicly leaving the EU would be an absolute disaster for Scotland ldquo. More recently, this year he joined his party leader Ruth Davidson in totally denouncing the No Deal option and confirming he would not support a No Deal because of its devastating effect, not just on Scotland, but on the whole of the UK.Should we voters care about this apparent lapse of integrity when at least Ruth Davidson, as well as  Conservative MPs, including former Cabinet Members , decided to put the country and their own beliefs before the narrow interests of the extreme right-wing Johnson Government Mr Mundell failed this week in his duty to represent his constituents by voting against his own and their democratically-expressed beliefs. Many Conservative voters, as well as those from other parties, the non-aligned, and of course young first-time voters whose future rests on decisions taken by their representatives, looked on and noted how they will vote in the next Westminster election.S Campbell, Moffat.AS everyone knows, Scotland is a member of the United Kingdom and the UK in turn is a member of the European Union. Scotland is only a member of the EU due to our country being a part of the UK so this oft wrung-out overture that Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU is a misnomer or a red herring as someone of Ruth Marrrsquos intellect knows full well . The referendum on EU membership was a UK-wide vote not a nation by nation or region by region vote. She might as well claim that the workers in the local pie factory voted overwhelmingly to remain and that the workers behind the counter in the tuck shop voted to leave.I am fed up hearing from the likes of Ian Blackford, Nicola Sturgeon el al claim that Scotland is being dragged out of the EU against its will. When will they realise that this argument would only stack upScotland had sole membership of the European Union Christopher H Jones, Gfnock.WITH regard to the letterfrom Gordon Bannatyne, in which it is argued that Britain should have adopted a tough stance with the EU right from the start, it begs the question ndash why  It is the disunited UK that wants to leave, not the EU ejecting anyone. As for the question ldquohow did we manage before the EU was formed , there is a simple answer ndash ldquonot very well. I am old enough to remember the wonderful days when strikes were a weekly occurrence, lights went out or never went on, when the three-day-week was introduced, when there were few human rights, no wildle directives, fishing was a catastrophe with species like herring almost wiped out, and an assortment of other failures bestowed on us all from the elite Old-Etonian ruling classes of arrogant England. Not forgetting their appointees the unelected Lords. Yes ndash how did we manage  Thankfully after joining the EU, the eyes of Scots and others were opened and intelligent laws passed, farming brought into the th century, fishing quotas introduced internationally, manufacturing industries co-operating across borders, free movement of people, many useful and necessary roadworks and bridges financed from monies paid in to the EU that would never have been handed out to many areas in Scotland and where.Why also are the Brexiters so eager to leave the EU  The population of the UK is around  million, not the  million who voted to leave, meaning  million and the remaining millions eligible to vote, but who did not vote on a spurious right-wing pack of lies, require to remain.Bernard Zonfrillo, Glasgow.HOLYROOD is just not the same without Ruth Davidson. Already she is badly missed. The ongoing Brexit madness makes her loss even more acute.The first exchanges between the pompous and prickly First Minister and Jackson Carlaw were only a shadow of what we have come to expect from the forensic and palpably honest Ruth Davidson. She was the champion of not only the Tories but of truth and all Scots and alone among opponents of the SNP could cause fear in the nationalist ranks and puncture regularly a few overblown egos.Will you norsquo come back again, Ruth Alexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.I WOULD like to point out that an election date on the week beginning October  will disenfranchise many Scottish voters.This date falls during most Scottish school half-term holidays when many potential voters will be away from their local areas.

Well thatrsquos a whole new legal ball game, but wersquoll cross that bridge when we come to it.The Prime Minister claims the prorogationis a standard reset of the parliamentary calendar ahead of his government setting out a fresh legislative programme.The Tories also argue prorogation will only a handful of days to the usual conference recess.However parliament ticks over in recess, but is shut down completely by prorogation.Mr Johnsonrsquos opponents say he is guilty of a ldquoconstitutional outrage designed to limit MPs time to debate Brexit and to stop a no-deal exit from the EU on October .On Wednesday at the Court of Session, Lord Doherty ruled the prorogation was lawful, agreeing with the UK Governmentrsquos lawyers that it was a matter of politics, not law.However Ms Cherry secured an immediate appeal to the courtrsquos Inner House, and on Thursday obtained the release of Downing Street memos about the prorogation process.They showed Mr Johnson approved suspending parliament  days before it was made public, despite UK Government lawyers insisting the matter remained ldquoacademic.On Friday, David Johnston QC for the UK Government and Aidan OrsquoNeill QC for the campaigners finished their arguments before the three appeal judges.Mr Johnston said that although some prerogative powers exercised by the PM were open to the court to review, it depended very much on the specic subject matter.He said the prorogation was a political matter and therefore outwith the ambit of the court.He also said that parliament could pass a law to stop the prorogationit chose.Mr OrsquoNeill said the governments powers were not unconstrained - otherwise there might be nothing to stop a prorogation lasting years.He said: ldquoProrogation is stopping the parliament sitting even against its will. That is why is it is an extraordinary power, because it goes to the heart of a representative democracy.ldquoItrsquos a power that can only be exercised with extreme caution for very good and true reasons, not whatever is thought to be politically advantageous.He said it was nonsensical to argue parliament could stop prorogation itself given it was due to start on Monday and it would take four days to pass an emergency law.After a brief discussion with his fellow judges, Lord Carloway said there were ldquoextremely dficult issues involved and it would ldquotake some time to consider them.He said: ldquoThe court will therefore make avizandum [take time to consider] and will not make any interim orders pending its decision on Wednesday."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10379379.jpg?type=article-full","title":"experienced-hidden-gems-highlands-islands-yet","story":"Highland TitlesAround twelve years ago, Highland Titles arrived in Duror. Since then theyhave seen theof Red Squirrels, Otters, Hedgehogs and even an Osprey to mention just a few.Caring for the land has inevitably progressed to caring for wildle, and endangered species has become something of a priority for the teamatHighland Titles. The construction of the biggest Wildcat Rehabilitation Centre in Europe was an amazing milestone, and to have three cats with themsince June has been unbelievable ndash arguably the rarest animal on the planet! It has also meant the construction of an additional two enclosures.Stewart Borland, the Reserve Manager,said ldquoBack in the early days, I donrsquot think many local people knew what we were about, but nowadays everyone understands crowd funding. We donrsquot take government funding or seek lottery money, we fund our own development by the sale of little souvenir plots of the Reserve.With around , people, from all over the world, visiting last year, local businesses have realised the value of these guests to their coffee shops, BBrsquos, hotels  restaurants too.ldquoThe construction of Loch Fois, which we stocked with Wild Brown Trout, and the repair and rebuilding of Loch Keil made a huge dference to our species list, and also proved a great location for our honey bee hives. I think just about everybody knows the importance of bees by now, but we are attempting to ensure our youngsters do too, by running an incredibly popular educational effort with our local schools. The children paint a hive and in conjunction with Webster Honey from Kinross,we visit each school for a presentation about bees, and then in summer, the best part, we hire buses and bring the kids to the Reserve, pop them in little bee suits and open up the hive and let them see and understand bees up close.Thenew facility, offering a forever home for injured Hedgehogs is also proving popular, with  hogs passing through to release and one injured one staying in the enclosure and being cared for byvolunteers. Theirnext project which is under construction is a Hedgehog Hospital so theycan build onearly successes.Also nearing completion is the final link in the Glencoe to Oban SusTrans Cycle Path, which Highland Titles gave free access to, to allow it across The Reserve rather than run alongside the busy main road ndash arguably one of the most beautul sections of the route.The Reserve is free to use, open  hours, seven days a week, and everyone iswelcome to visit.www.highlandtitles-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Karen Duncan JewelleryBorn and bred in Orkney, Karen Duncan has designed and created jewellery for over  years.

The society now also delivers animal welfare educational programmes, reaching more than , children in .So it’s fair to say that it has come a long way in the last  years.But for all the successes, there are also new issues it has to face – not least thanks to the advent of the internet.Mike explained: “For years, we have looked after all of Scotland’s animals – wild, farm and domestic.“Farming has come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades and we now have very few problems in the industry.“When I was a kid growing up, you used to have pet shops selling cats, dogs, budgies and the like.“Now, thanks to the internet, people have far more exotic animals in their care which all of our inspectors need to know how to care for and handle – from bearded dragons to massive boa constrictors!“We also have to contend with puppy farmers plying their trade online and selling puppies from car boots.“Some of the puppies die within a few days of people buying them, having paid a lot of money for the animal and thousands on vet fees.“Sadly, we also still see things that I saw  years ago such as Dobermans with every rib on their body sticking out.“However, thanks to our education programme, we are reaching the children of today who will be the animal lovers of the future.“And the majority of people our inspectors visit are not harming animals for fun – it’s a case of ignorance and neglect. In those cases, we’re not just helping the animals, but humans too.“Only five to ten per cent of cases every year are intentional cruelty. So Scotland is still a nation which, in the main, loves and cares for its animals.”That care and concern shines through as the public helps fund the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team based at its nine centres across Scotland and its widle sanctuary.The society receives no government funding and relies solely on the public to fund its work.Mike added: “We are really lucky that, from a population of five and a half million, only  people were prosecuted last year for animal cruelty.“We will never be out of a job but the vast majority of people in Scotland are law abiding and animal loving.“And we couldn’t do what we do without their support.”In December, the Society plans to launch celebrations to commemorate the th anniversary that will run throughout .Anyone with interesting anecdotes or memorabilia they’d like to share should get in touch via its website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service. The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work, which costs £ million each year.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.

Local charity the Blide Trust put a lot of work into ensuring the gardens are kept up to a high standard and are a peaceful and welcoming place to relax and rewind in. Sadly, there seems to be an ongoing problem of anti-social behaviour in the gardens.“If people hear or see something and are concerned, please noty the police immediately.

The High Street is also set to be closed to traffic between North Bridge and St Marys Street.And the strategy includes proposals for \"reallocation of traffic lanes\" on a host of streets including Cowgate, the Bridges corridor, Lothian Road, St Andrew Square and Princes Street to improve provision for buses, cyclists and pedestrians.There would be a widened pedestrian priority zone and a more joined-up cycling network.And a \"hopper\" bus operating around the city centre will be trialled as a step towards the councils long-term aim of having more buses routed to but not through the central area.Proposals for a city centre tram \"spur link\" to join up a networkthe line is extended north to south in the future has not officially been included in the proposals, but space has been leftplans are progressed.The councils final strategy for the Edinburgh City Centre Transformation has been published after around  per cent of the public backed the vision in the second round of public consultation. It will be discussed by the authoritys transport and environment committee on Thursday next week.The first phase of the ambitious project, to take place over the next five years, includes closure of Waverley Bridge in conjunction with Network Rails Waverley Masterplan, ambitious cycling infrastructure projects, the trial of the city centre public hopper bus and car-free streets in the Old Town. But more than £m will need to be found for the final phase of the strategy, which includes creating a tree-lined bouled on Lothian Road, integrated public transport ticketing and timetabling and a new cycling and walking bridge linking Old Town and New Town.Officials say that the project could potentially generate £m of \"quantiable benefits\" based on £.m of investment.Project director Daisy Narayanan said there has been a \"head in the stars, feet on the ground approach\" to the vision.She added: \"Phase one of the project we have funding for already, phase two is feasibility studies which we are hoping to have about £.m for and phase three is £m capital and £m of revenue - its a very cautious figure. Its making sure the delivery plan is rooted in reality and we can deliver it.\"If and when tram line three happens, the business case should include the spur line. As a city centre, we think that spur is necessary. Its not part of the costs, buttheres a tram line three, it is future-proofing the city centre.\"The council aims to provide \"a cohesive network of pedestrian priority and car-free streets connecting Waverley with key areas of the Old Town\". Footpaths will be widened on key pedestrian routes - with traffic lanes removed to make way. A pedestrian priority zone would be created in the city centre \"where people have priority and vehicles are guests\".The strategy also points to a \"reduced volume of buses crossing the city centre without a loss in the routes served\" - while bus journeys will be speeded up \"through signal prioritisation and bus-stop rationalisation\".The plans are likely to be welcomed by many, including environmental campaigners, but others may be concerned about aspects of the proposals, including the impact on bus services.: Edinburgh : \"This is le affirming stuff....\" What you had to say about radical new city centre plansTransport and environment convener, Cllr Lesley Macinnes, said: \"This is broadly what we think we will be doing across  years. A big part of that is laying out a programme of delivery for  years and our funding strategy. We are building in a degree of flexibility into that.\"We really are attempting to do this in as comprehensive, informed and intelligent way to make sure we end up delivering the right thing at the right time. Everybody is moving in the same direction - we would be a foolish citywe turned around and headed back down the other side of the motorway.\"The principle of a north-south tram link is clear.

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree.

On Friday , Mrs Steenson received a call informing her that no bus was available due and mix-up between the EA and the transport provider. Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mrs Steenson said she had “issue after issue” during the summer months due to their errors.“My experience of it is that the Education Authority has a lot of people off sick, they are understaffed and there is a lot of pressure, and there just isn’t enough transport places available for the kids that need them. There are children being let down, and for us personally, it’s just not doable. We both work, and it’s an hour-and-a-half to get down to Fleming and back up again, so to do that while working and bringing our other child to school is impossible.”She continued: “This week we have been very lucky that my work has been flexible and allowed me to take some times, but that’s not sustainable. I hope that her transport can get organised very very quickly so that she can go to school. We have prepared her for going on the bus or getting in a taxi and she’s wondering why it’s not happening – it’s confusing for her.”She added: “I don’t know what we’re going to do. It’ll be very stressful. There’ll probably be days where she can’t make it in because we can’t get transport. I might have to take more time off or my husband might have to.”Despite complaints from parents, the Education Authority has said there has been no reduction to transport services.A spokesperson for the Education Authority , said: “EA provides transport assistance to over , children every day, including , children with Statement of Special Educational Need.“We remain committed to ensuring that all necessary arrangements are in place ahead of the new school year.“In this case, EA’s transport service provision has been maintained and there has been no reduction to services at either school. Where parents are experiencing any issue with their child’s school transport we would encourage and advise them to call their local school transport office, which can be accessed by calling the EA Transport enquiries line   .”"},{"url":null,"title":"sign up for our weekly brexit newsletter","story":"Your browser is outdated, it may not render this page properly, please upgrade.Select any of your favourite newsletters and get them delivered straight to your inbox||||Main Area|Daily News Headlines - checkbox|Pos[:]|\"type\"checkbox\" name\"newsletters\" id\"f-newsletters-BT_DailyNews\" value\"BT:DailyNews\" class\"tick-a\"  Daily News Headlines Daily News from belfasttelegraphPreview Subscribe||||Main Area|Weekly Business Digest - checkbox|Pos[:]|\"type\"checkbox\" name\"newsletters\" id\"f-newsletters-BT_WeeklyBusiness\" value\"BT:WeeklyBusiness\" class\"tick-a\"  Weekly Business Digest Weekly Business Digest from belfasttelegraphPreview Subscribe||||Main Area|BelfastTravel - checkbox|Pos[:]|\"type\"checkbox\" name\"newsletters\" id\"f-newsletters-BT_Travel\" value\"BT:Travel\" class\"tick-a\"  BelfastTravel Travel news headlines and offers directly to your inbox.

He said of Northern Ireland that the people were British, but the cattle were Irish.\"And in that idea there is the germ of a solution to the question of frictionless movement across the Northern Irish border.\"We do want to minimise all theoretical checks as well as practical checks.\"We think all practical checks can of course be taken away from the border theres no need...\"And the UK will not be instituting any border checks of any kind in Northern Ireland.\"We also think there is scope for recognition of the practical reality on the ground in the agri-food sector in Northern Ireland.\"Whether that could be extended to other sectors \"depends entirely on democratic control by the people of the United Kingdom\".Rev Paisleys reference to cows here being Irish were first revealed by Jonathan Powell, a former adviser to Tony Blair during the peace talks that led to the Good Friday Agreement.He wrote: \"The border between Ireland and the UK just came to mean much less once we were both in the EU.\"This was particularly brought home to me when Ian Paisley, the fire-breathing DUP leader, came to see Tony Blair in the midst of the  Foot and Mouth crisis in the UK and in an attempt to take advantage of the looser restrictions on movement of cattle in the south than in the north said, Our people may be British but our cows are Irish.\"Mr Johnsons reference to Rev Paisley - later Lord Bannside - will be seen as an attempt to ameliorate DUP concerns, as the proposal appears to cross the DUPs red line of having a border in the Irish Sea. data-dfpadtargetingTaoiseach Leo VaradkarBut in an apparent softening of its position, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds has said his party is open to discussions with Mr Johnson on a possible all-Ireland food standards zone as part of a solution to the Brexit backstop.A dossier drawn up for the Government has described an all-island economy for food and agricultural products as the \"most practical\" and \"deliverable\" alternative to the backstop.The secret papers prepared for Mr Johnson show the best substitute for the backstop is broadly similar to what is currently on the table - and would create a regulatory barrier between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Dated August  and marked \"official-sensitive\", the document said \"regulatory alignment\" between Northern Ireland and the Republic would be the most likely way of breaking the current impasse.The document was prepared for the EU Exit Negotiations Board and sets out a timeline for the UK to actually produce alternative ideas to the backstop.Meanwhile, in the Commons, DUP deputy leader Mr Dodds welcomed \"remarks of the Foreign Minister of the Irish Republic yesterday in which indicated that in the event of a no-deal there will be no checks or infrastructure at the border\".\"Thats very, very welcome - we should build on that, in that there is room for progress to get a deal, which we all want.\"Elsewhere, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said talks on the backstop should be the easiest part of the Brexit process, ahead of a showdown with Mr Johnson.Mr Varadkar has indicated he will not be in a compromising mood when the Prime Minister goes to Dublin on Monday.Irish officials are confident the meeting will go ahead despite Mr Johnsons plan to try to collapse his own Government that evening. But the Taoiseach has sought to turn up the pressure on his counterpart, saying he will not allow the UK to \"merely kick the can down the road\".\"A Withdrawal Agreement without the backstop is no good to us,\" Mr Varadkar told the British Irish Chamber of Commerce last night.He hopes Mr Johnson will bring genuine proposals to Farmleigh House - but added that in any event \"there is no such thing as a clean break\".The Prime Ministers priority now appears to be convincing parliament to sanction an election on October .He claimed legislation which forces him to seek a delay to Brexit has \"absolutely torpedoed\" his negotiating position.Despite MPs coming together to block a disorderly Brexit, the Irish Governments assessment is that no-deal remains the most likely outcome.Signicantly, Mr Varadkar said last night that this would result in checkpoints \"near the border\". Previously the Irish Government has refused to go further than to say checks would be \"away\" from the border.Ministers are wary of the motivations behind Mr Johnsons trip to Dublin given he has stated the negotiations cannot proceed without a UK election first.However, ministers are keen for the meeting to take place so that Mr Varadkar can personally reiterate a willingness to work with the UKthey produce workable alternatives to the backstop."},{"url":null,"title":"peers approve bid to prevent government forcing through nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The legislation requires a delay to Brexit beyond October  unless a orce deal is approved or Parliament agrees to leaving the EU without one by October . It sailed through its final stages in the Lords without amendment and is now expected to receive royal assent on Monday, thereby completing all stages required to become law. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously labelled it the \"surrender Bill\" and claimed it takes away control of the UKs negotiations with the EU by allowing Parliament to block no-deal. Closing the debate in the Lords, Brexit minister Lord Callanan said the Bill brought \"delay and uncertainty\" while undermining the Governments efforts to negotiate the Withdrawal Agreement. He said it also aimed to tie the Prime Ministers hands when he was seeking to secure the best possible Brexit deal. But he assured peers the legislation would be presented for royal assent. \"This Bill is about seriously undermining negotiations that could achieve a deal before October , frustrating the referendum result and stopping Brexit,\" Lord Callanan said. Earlier, peers rejected by  votes to , majority , a bid to remove an amendment included in the Commons, paving the way for MPs to debate Theresa Mays final Brexit deal during a Brexit extension to next January. The amendment, tabled by Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, was only passed after tellers for those voting against it were not put forward. Tory peers argued this was a mistake which should be corrected to make clear and effective law. Lord Callanan said the amendment was \"confusingly drafted\", contradictory to the aims of the legislation and \"legally inoperable\". For the Opposition, Lord Goldsmith said it did no harm to keep it in the Bill because there was not time to send it back to the Commons for further consideration due to the \"guillotine of prorogation imposed by the Prime Minister\". Conservative peer Lord True also saw his amendment, which aimed to prevent the legislation from coming into force until a general election has taken place in , rejected by  votes to , majority . Lord True had argued: \"How many more times must the British people be asked to take a delay  \"How many more times must they tolerate those who wished to change the policy which Parliament has agreed, the vote that Parliament has made that this country should leave the European Union - enacted on the face of the statute book - on October   \"How much more must they take from those who want this country to remain and want it to stop  \"I think there will be a limit to the tolerance of many people in this country and I beseech all those involved to allow the cleansing balm of a general election to allow all those, whatever their views, to put their case to the people.\" Labour described Lord Trues proposal as a \"wrecking amendment\" and successfully led the opposition to it."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As part of his instructions, which he wrote in , £, was each given to Labour MP Dennis Skinner and Private Eye investigative journalist Paul Halloran. Another £, was donated to two English residents.The remainder of his estate, which included assets in Ireland, England, Singapore and New Zealand, was handed to the executors and trustees of his will - Joe Cahill and Dessie Mackin - for Sinn Fein.At the time Mr Cahill and Mr Mackin were the partys national treasurers. Their address is listed as  Parnell Square, which is the partys headquarters in Dublin.It was outlined in Mr Hamptons will that the money was to be used to cover election expenses, to fund Sinn Fein offices and advice centres, and to aid republican prisoners and their families in both Ireland and Britain.Mr Hamptons will stated: \"In the event that the organisation which is now known as Sinn Fein should cease to be in existence or should have split or taken a dferent name at the date of death then I direct that my executors and trustees are to apply my monies to the political party to which Mr Gerry Adams MP then belongs.\"\"Should Mr Adams pre-decease me or not be a member of any political party at the date of my death then I direct that my executors and trustees shall apply my monies to the republican or nationalist political party in the six counties, other than the SDLP, which has the largest number of elected councillors.\"Mr Hamptons donation was made public on Thursday by the Electoral Commission.A Probate Registry of Wales document confirms that when he died on January , , at a nursing home in Pembrokeshire, Mr Hampton left an estate in the UK worth £,,.However, at the time of writing his will in , he was living in a mobile home in Ireland. He states in it that he is \"presently of no fixed abode\".It states he had former addresses in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. The pensioner, who was unmarried and had no children, was born in London and was a long-term supporter of Sinn Fein.Mr Hamptons will and probate document, as in the case of any deceased person, are available for public inspection. The donation to Sinn Fein was paid to the party in instalments of £m and £, in April and May this year.The size of the UK estate and the mention of other global assets means that Sinn Fein may yet be in line for further donations from Mr Hampton.Under HM Revenue  Customs rules, Sinn Fein will not have to pay any inheritance tax on the £.m gt as any political party that has at least two MPs in the House of Commons is not liable to do so.Sinn Fein has seven MPs but because of a Westminster abstentionist policy they do not take their seats in the house.A political party also qualies for exemptionit has one MP and received no less than , votes at the last general election. Without exemptions, anyone who is left £.m would be required to pay around £, in inheritance tax."},{"url":null,"title":"taoiseach says checks may be carried out near border in event of nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We worked with Nerve Visual to bring two of our most impactful exhibitions from the Ulster Museum to Derry.”The exhibitions referred to are Silent Testimony and Art of the Troubles. “Derry needs this gallery!” she added.The Nerve Centre reopened the former Turner Prize gallery space as Nerve Visual in June  when it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.A spokesperson for the Nerve Centre said it has received no core funding and was programmed and funded on a project by project basis.In just over three years it has hosted  successful exhibitions.However, writer and art critic Dominic Kearney said he couldn’t understand why it was so poorly attended, particularly as the Turner Prize was such a success at the same location.Nerve Visual only took over a section of the Creative Hub Building   in  but during the City of Culture year in  the same gallery space hosted the prestigious Turner Prize - one of the best-known visual arts prizes in the world.Mr Kearney believes the location is “terric” and “exactly” what Ebrington needs. “The space is perfect for a gallery and the exhibitions that they had there were very impressive.“The Troubles Art exhibition, Future Artist Makers and the Colin Davidson one was stunning, I’d hesitate to say beautul given the nature of its subject, but it was incredibly powerful.“It’s the only gallery that’s open to the public in Derry that deals with mainstream, accessible, representational art. For this to close is really going to detract from the local art scene, from Ebrington, the Waterside and Derry as a whole. Like a pebble dropped in a pond, the ripple effect will spread out from that building to the outer ring of the entire city.”He added: “It’s such a shame, in six years it’s gone from hosting the most prestigious modern art competition in UK to a couple of empty rooms.“People can only have so many cups of coffee, tourists need something to do when visiting the city. If there was a gallery dedicated to Irish art with links to galleries in Dublin, the Ulster Museum, and maybe Britain. Tourists would definitely want to go there as galleries are the type of thing people look for.”‘Massive draw’Local artists were regularly showcased at the Nerve Visual gallery.Stephen Lewis has lived in Derry for over  years, he’s an artist based at Bishop Street Studios who also works with the arts charities Creative Village Arts and ArtLink at Fort Dunree. He expressed his “disappointment” at the gallery’s closure.“There have been recent initiatives by the Nerve Visual, Tower Museum and An Culturalann to give folk here a chance to see art that is held in their own national collections - but it simply goes back to the inability to keep a space that is equipped to do this open.“People in the North West should not have to travel to Belfast to see their own art - The Ulster Museum often has  or  art exhibitions on at any one time - we built a world class gallery in  and we really should demand that this becomes our space to see our own art collections - properly advertised it could be a massive draw for locals and tourists alike.\"It’s understood there will be plenty of people interested in taking over occupancy of the building but at this stage it is unclear what will be based there.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magnificent moon monty cracking cornish sunset super images powys county times camera club members","story":"Moonshine over the Mpontgomery War Memorial from David Lister.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA Buff tailed bumbleebee on Cosmos from Lizzie Wood.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA frog in my wildle garden, says Lizzie Wood. \" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA beautul Cornish sunset as sent in by Paul Hanrahan.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA beautul Cornish sunset as sent in by Paul Hanrahan.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA duck along the canal from Robin Bridgen.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA dragonfly at Llandrindod Wells lakeside from Laura Shepherd.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA beautul Cornish sunset as sent in by Paul Hanrahan.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetSunrise over Newtown from Robin Bridgen.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetThe Royal Welsh may be gone, says Steven Derek, but this is still worth posting.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetDferent birds, dferent wire says Toni Mannell with reference to her earlier ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtposting.lt spangtlt spangt\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetMore fun with fungi on the Rainbow Walks near Llangadfan from Toni Mannell.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetNot all Montgomery visitors are human - bugs enjoying our herb garden, says Daviltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtd Wilson.lt spangtlt spangt\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetCamera club\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"elan show one best","story":"The championship in the terrier section went to Jason Davies of Pantydwr with Toltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtnic.

Competing in the competition for the first time, Andrew ploughed excellently over both days, winning a bronze medal on day one.With an aggregate score over the two days of competition used to crown the world champion, it was all to plough for on day two which focused on grassland.And Andrew was in good company with three former world champions making up the top five positions on the first day.He ploughed another fantastic plot to finish in fth place on day two, which placed him fourth overall, picking up the best newcomer award.Andrew said it has always been his dream to compete at the world contest.ldquoIt has been an unbelievable experience and I am so delighted to have won a medal. I am indebted for all the support I have received, particularly from my family, he said.Listooder Ploughing Society chairman Martin Gill spoke of his delight following the gala awards presentation.He said: ldquoTo go to the world contest for the first time, using borrowed equipment and to compete with the best in the world, winning a bronze medal and best newcomer title is a fantastic achievement.ldquoListooder has a long and successful history in ploughing. All three of our members who have competed at the world contest have all come home medal winners.In the reversible class, Hillsboroughrsquos James Coulter, who was also competing at the world contest for the first time, produced another fantastic performance.After finishing th on day one, James ploughed a fantastic plot the day after to win a bronze medal on grassland, finishing fourth overall and winning the best newcomer for the class.There will be little time for Andrew and James to celebrate as they prepare to compete in the Northern Ireland Championships at Cookstown this weekend..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin primary school opens new sensory garden  ","story":"CHILDREN, teachers and parents at St Maryrsquos Primary School, Aughlisnafin, celebrated the completion of a sensory garden and outdoor learning centre at the school with a barbecue and family fun night last Friday.The garden was officially opened by the school principal, Paddy Hardy, and Laura Brennan, chairperson of the schoolrsquos parent-teacher association.The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service and the RNLI were in attendance to advise the children on fire and water safety.Another special guest was Down gaelic footballer Rory Burns, who took on the children in a lsquoBeat the Goaliersquo competition.The school staff got involved by raising funds with a lsquoSponge the Teacherrsquo event which was a highlight for the children.A total of pound, was raised from all the activities and the barbecue.The school wishes to Fresh Food Centre, Castlewellan, Finnegans Butchers, Castlewellan, and Eurospar, Clough, for their donations.The school also wishes to thank everyone who attended the event for their support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Ban.jpg","title":"Ban on circuses with live animals  ","story":"CIRCUSES using live animals will be banned from performing throughout the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.The move calling for the council not to grant entertainment licences to circuses using live animals was passed at Monday nightrsquos full council meeting.It echoes back to a previous ban enforced by the legacy Down District Council which prohibited circuses with live animals performing on council facilities.The notice of motion, tabled by Alliance councillor Patrick Brown, was supported by  councillors. The only dissenting voice came from the DUPrsquos Harry Harvey, who voted against.The DUP councillor took an alternative view on the perceived harmful effect that circus le has on animals.Cllr Harvey said: ldquoI wonrsquot be supporting this motion as circus animals are very well trained and well trained animals are generally happy and well looked after.Cllr Brown told the meeting that many animals travelling with circuses were ldquosubjected to constantly being moved around cramped temporary housing, forced training and performance, loud noises and intimidating crowds of people.He continued: ldquoTravelling circus le is likely to have a harmful effect on animal welfare as captive animals are unable to socialise, get enough exercise or exhibit natural behaviours. Many animals develop behavioural and or health problems as a direct result of the captive le that they are forced to lead.He said that a recent report commissioned by the Welsh Government concluded that: ldquoLe for wild animals in travelling circuses... does not appear to constitute either a lsquogood lersquo or a lsquole worth livingrsquo.ldquoThe Irish government recently saw footage from the Animal Defenders International group which showed elephants and camels being repeatedly punched and hit with sticks to perform, said Cllr Brown.He added: ldquoIn May, the UK Government announced it would be banning wild animals in circuses from early . The Irish Government banned wild animals in January .ldquoAs usual, this being a devolved issue, Northern Ireland is behind the times yet again. This issue was actually raised in the Assembly as far back as  by my good friend Jim Wells MLA, who was very critical of the failure of Michelle OrsquoNeillrsquos Agriculture department to include such provisions in the Welfare of Animals Act .The councillor argued that some of the worldrsquos best circuses, such as the Cirque de Soleil, ddid not use any animals which ldquoreflects a global trend towards human-centered performances that no longer use animals, including the Russian and Chinese state circuses.He added: ldquoHopefully council will lead the way on animal welfare and pass this motion.The motion was seconded by fellow Alliance councillor Gregory Bain.Downpatrick SDLP councillor John Trainer, who also supported the motion said circuses did not provide a natural habitat for animals.DUP councillor Billy Walker, UUP councillor David Taylor and Sinn Feacuteinrsquos Willie Clarke all supported the motion on behalf of their respective parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Community.jpg","title":"Community bid to halt church’s sale of Crossgar centre  ","story":"CHURCH officials in Crossgar are being asked to abort plans to sell a building and consider donating it to local people instead.The community centre in Downpatrick Street mdash which was a former pub mdash was purchased two decades ago but is now on the market for sale as a commercial unit.Representatives of the Church of the Immaculate Conception and St Joseph are planning to meet with community representatives to explain the reasons for the sale which are understood to centre around increased running costs and reduced numbers of people using the facility.Community officials have expressed an interest in working with Newry, Mourne and Down Council to take over the running of the building,agreement could be reached to donate it to the people of Crossgar.They believe that the building offers major potential and could be developed to provide a range of services to meet the needs of a wide range of cross-community groups in the village.Community representatives want the meeting with church officials to be open to localpeople, arguing that a lot of public money has already been invested in the property over recent years which is used by the Crossgar Youth League among others.ldquoThe building could be transformed into a modern community centre with the right investment and commitment. There is a parking area at the rear with spaces for around  vehicles andthese are lost what happens, especially during the summer months when the villagersquos popular Youth League is in full flow, said one community official.ldquoLocal people have been using the property for around  years and we would very much like church officials to consider donating it to them so they can take it over and work with others to manage the running costs.Community officials say there was a need for a dedicated indoor community facility in Crossgar which would meet the needs of many groups and organisations.The added ldquoplans for a major new sports complex unveiled a number of years never came to fruition and were unlikely to in the future.Officials believe thatthe Downpatrick Street building was donated to the people of the village, its future as a community base could potentially be guaranteed.Community officials insist that one of their key priorities is looking after Crossgar Youth League which continues to go from strength to strength and also uses the car park at the rear of the building to store equipment.ldquoIt is no onersquos fault that the Downpatrick Street building is being sold. If there are concerns around its running costs why doesnrsquot the parish come and talk to us and give us the opportunity to work alongside others and take it over  suggested one community official.ldquoThere was a major push to open this building many years ago and a lot of public money was invested in it. The property is critical to the success of the Crossgar Youth League and is an enormous community benefit. It is the best thing we have in the village.ldquoThe loss of the building would have an enormous impact on the Youth League and indeed the Crossgar community. There is potential to do so much with the property and we hope it is not lost to the people of the village.

Existing paths will also be upgraded.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker mdash who has been lobbying for the existing pedestrian crossing to be upgraded mdash is delighted that it is finally going to happen.ldquoThe scheme has been included in the Department for Infrastructurersquos programme and will be installed as pat of the forthcoming environmental improvement scheme, he explained.ldquoI am delighted that after years of lobbying, this much-needed scheme is finally now in the programme and will be delivered. I hope that it will be delivered as soon as possible, given the huge volume of traffic which passes through the centre of the town each day.Cllr Walker said a number of traffic surveys have been carried out over the years to determine the need for an upgraded crossing and is pleased that one is finally going to be delivered and will be paid for by the Department for Infrastructure.ldquoThe importance of this puffin crossing cannot be highlighted enough, he continued. ldquoThe new crossing will see the provision of Killyleaghrsquos first set of traffic lights which in itself is signicant. The traffic lights will ensure drivers come to a complete halt while people are crossing.Cllr Walker said a number of people using the existing pedestrian crossing were hit by cars, while there were ldquocountless near misses.ldquoWhen people press the button on the new puffin crossing, traffic will stop immediately to allow them to cross safely. My thanks go to roads officials for finally agreeing that an upgraded crossing is necessary, he continued.ldquoThe biggest concern many in Killyleagh have is the speed of vehicles approaching Catherine Street from the Comber direction. The new puffin crossing will address this issue at what is a particularly busy main street which is notoriously dficult to cross, even with the presence of the current crossing.Cllr Walker said people need to be able to bring traffic to a halt so they can cross in safety. He is also delighted with the planned environmental improvement scheme and has no doubt it will have a positive impact on the town centre.He added: ldquoA number of similar schemes carried out in other towns and villages across the district have had a signicant impact, helping restore pride and encouraging businesses and residents to spruce up their respective premises.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed the council was developing proposals to bring forward seven environmental improvement schemes across the district, one of which is proposed for Killyleagh.ldquoIt is anticipated that this will include upgrade works to pathways, street lighting and street furniture, he explained.ldquoImplementation of the works is however subject to planning approval and the council being successful in an application for funding to the Rural Development Programme.

But he conceded that theof -hour AE services may be dficult.Mr McGoran was invited to address the Down Community Health Committee and said it was important that the South Eastern Trust was having a conversation with campaigners who are keen to continue discussions with officials to ensure the retention of existing services and the delivery of enhanced provision moving forward.Over previous years, relations between both organisations was particularly fraught at times and while they did not always see eye to eye, Mr McGoran hopes they can now move forward together.He said he had ldquonothing but respect for the Down community because local people cared about their health and social care services, committing time and energy to make sure the area gets the best provision it can.ldquoThis is not always obvious everywhere in Northern Ireland, Mr McGoran continued. ldquoYou have been at this for a long time and I have no doubt that without your campaigning work we would not have some of the things we have in this organisation today. I am also not sure that we would have the Downe Hospital.ldquoYour contribution and those who went before you has been fundamental in keeping this area in the spotlight, fighting ultimately for your services. I take my hat off to you. The Downe is here to stay and we have a fantastic facility and there are no staff better. In fact, we have incredible staff who work right across the organisation.Mr McGoran said that while administrators and campaigners may not have always agreed in the past about how the health trust did things, he suggested they all had the same aim mdashwanting the best health and social care that could be delivered, sometimes within challenging resources.Looking to the future, the health chief referred to an ongoing review of emergency care which has resulted in the group overseeing the exercise visiting the Downe and meeting with senior health officials.ldquoI do envisage that there is going to be further change for emergency medicine but when I was asked the question what did I think about the future of the service at the Downe, Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals in  yearsrsquo time, I could not really answer that, explained Mr McGoran.ldquoI was prepared to say what it would be like in five yearsrsquo time, but could not look beyond that. A five year vision is really something that you can get a hold of and we made it clear to those in charge of the review that the emergency care model we have in place at the Downe will be here in five yearsrsquo time.Mr McGoran said the health trust was on record with the Department of Health during the early stages of the current engagement that it still sees the current model at the Downe comprising the emergency department, out of hours GP service and weekend nurse-led minor injuries unit remaining in place.ldquoWe will still have acute beds in the Downe and it will deal with medically unwell patients. All of the current infrastructure we have will remain in place and our vision is to expect these to remain in place for the next five years, he confirmed.Mr McGoran said the one caveat was that it remained to be seen what the Department of Health will do with the information it has been provided with in relation to the future of emergency care, suggesting serious conversations about the way forward have only just begun.He added: ldquoThere is work ongoing and at some point there may be a consultation exercise. I do not know where all this is going to go and it is a bit early to speculate.Community Health Committee chairman Eamonn McGrady welcomed the health officialrsquos ldquoconstructive and honest engagement with campaigners.He said: ldquoWe need to go forward in a partnership, but that does not mean that we will always agree. Our community supports the Downe Hospital and also the centres of excellence in the bigger hospitals that our delivering our health needs.ldquoBut we need as much care as possible provided as locally as possible, safely and well adequately resourced in a brilliant building.Mr McGrady added: ldquoI hope that in five yearsrsquo time we will be looking at a very major extension at the Downe and a major increase in capacity. We are we are going to need a lot more beds and a lot more space..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Dundrum 2.jpg","title":"Dundrum come good to knock Kilclief out of JFC  ","story":"A SERIOUSLY depleted Kilclief side went into this showdown full of apprehension and that was fully justied given Dundrumrsquos potential.Despite this, Kilclief settled quickly and a point from Conan Hynds gave them the lead.

mdash not in protest but as a gesture of sympathy to those bereaved by the murders.The motion was introduced by Saintfield councillor, Mr William Finlay, who said he looked back with horror at the murders, the victims including  soldiers at Warrenpoint, Lord Mountbatten, his grandson, Nicholas , the Dowager Lady Brabourne, and a  year-old boy, Paul Maxwell.Acting chairman, Mr Paddy

without any debate whether or not they wanted to adjourn the meeting.He added: ldquoHowever, whether or not the council decides to adjourn should not be interpreted as to whether or not councillors

This was foreseen in the design of St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse where there is excellent lantern sidewall and cowling ventilation in a tower  feet above the ground in this remote location. There is little hazard from the liquid mercury since it is not readily absorbed dermally.Campaigners have suggested that it would be interesting to see CILrsquos lighthouse keeper health monitoring records for mercury covering the past  years and more when the lighthouse was manned and used the present system. They also said it would be interestingto see the training records for keepers in safe mercury handling during all these years. ldquoPresumably, these would have been managed by independent bodies of experts since the Commissioners probably didnrsquot previously have and donrsquot today have any toxicological experts on your permanent payroll, says the campaigners letter.Another area of concern highlighted is the poor state of the lighthouse, including adjoining housing which a delegation from the Commissionerrsquos office recently visited.Campaigners point to the ldquolamentable state of the walls of the lighthouse station and the grounds, suggesting that they present a picture of ldquowoeful neglect and asking how CIL can expect the public to be impressed with a lack of basic asset maintenance.The letter highlights that the current Fresnel lens system turns  hours a day and is clearly visible from the road outside the lighthouse station.Campaigners say this in itself is a visual attraction during daylight hours ldquosince the magnicent large lens system is big enough to be seen turning on itrsquos mercury bearing and is even more magnicent at night.The letter continues: ldquoWe believe that CIL will miss a tremendous opportunity to preserve this lighthouse and its sweeping beamyou persist with your alternative bearing plans. The whole lighthouse station could become part of a wider tourist attraction in the area. Future generations will thank you for retaining the current historic beam system, still going smoothly after  years and showing no signs of obsolescence. You have not made an economic case for change of lens system at St Johnrsquos Point as far as we know and it is dficult to see how you can.ldquoWhat happens at the lighthouse remains the focus of keen and widespread local and political interest in this area and we will ensure this continues to be a high-profile local issue.The letter adds: ldquoLecale Lightkeepers are willing to fully support CIL and others in any preservation programme that involves retaining the sweeping beam. However, we reject the idea that the use of mercury in this lens bearing application represents a health hazard that cannot be managed by a sensible, low-cost maintenance programme involving chiefly adequate ventilation.

If we ever have to renew the battle with the IRA, we shall do so from a position less favourable than that of August . If we merely have to maintain our position, we are liable to suffer increasing casualties and to be forced to employ not only greater numbers of soldiers but also higher degrees of force merely to maintain that position.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button He went on: “If I am right, and we want a lasting solution, it must lie in finding a way in which HMG can gradually escape from the commitment to the border. The answer appears to lie with the plebiscite.“It would have to be organised in such a way that it shows up the inequity of the existing border and leads to the situation which Lloyd George persuaded Arthur Grfiths and Michael Collins that it wouldie. one in which it made no sense for Belfast, Co Down and Co Antrim to remain separate.“If this radical view is accepted, political discussions to erect a new Stormont or something in its place are a waste of time. Discussions, whether arising from an end to violence, a truce or a failure of the present policy, should centre on the plebiscite.”Another solider, David Hancock, said that when loyalists attacked the Army on the Shankill Road “it was the first time that any of us...had been fired at by people carrying the Union Jack.

Image: BBC SpotlightAlthough it has long been known that Mr McGuinness was an IRA commander, he refused to discuss his actions in the organisation and insisted that he had never killed anyone.The images will be broadcast next Tuesday in the first part of one of BBC Northern Ireland’s most ambitious projects, a two-year re-examination of the Troubles which will run over seven programmes. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The first programme in the series also includes a former colonel saying that he was shown evidence by the RUC that Ian Paisley, the future First Minister, had supplied the money for explosives which caused one of the first explosions of the Troubles.The rare footage of an IRA car bomb being assembled was filmed in Londonderry in the early years of the Troubles.During the programme, former IRA bomber Shane Paul O’Doherty commentated on the pictures, saying: “There’s a huge charge there. A very dangerous alarm clock timer that could blow them all to hell.”When asked who he recognised, he said: “Well, there’s Martin....Martin McGuinness.” Mr O’Doherty said he was certain that it was the future deputy First Minister, saying “nobody walks like him, with a stoop in his back”.The car containing the bomb could be identied by its number plate. The BBC programme includes footage of the bomb exploding  minutes later in the centre of Mr McGuinness’s home city, Londonderry.The day after the bombing, Northern Ireland Prime Minister Brian Faulkner was brought to London to be told that security powers would be removed from Stormont and taken on by Westminster, leading to the collapse of Stormont.The Spotlight programme also includes footage of Mr McGuinness showing guns to young children and handing them bullets while seated in a car.Commentating on the film pictures, Mr O’Doherty said: “It’s Martin McGuinness. Very young, tall, handling weapons – a rle and a revolver – rolling up to a load of kids who are staring in the windows, craning in the windows and showing them bullets.“It’s horric, really, because here was McGuinness showing eight, nine and -year-olds guns and bullets that were exciting. People had a feeling that you were on television, you know, you were superstars.”Police had evidence Ian Paisley paid for Troubles bombing, says ex-colonel Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The programme does not explain the background to the footage. However, Spotlight reporter Darragh MacIntyre said that it would be made clear in a future film in the series.He said that it had been shot by an American documentary maker and was never broadcast.Mr McIntyre, the reporter who in  exposed the then DUP MP Iris Robinson’s affair and financial dealings with property developers, said that the  footage “speaks to a time when within Free Derry and where in the north there was a sense that the IRA had it won, that they were the original guerrilla fighters and within a matter of months would see their way to a new united Ireland...so they were quite free - not just Martin McGuinness - when they were filming with this documentary team”.In , Mr McGuinness told the journalist Eamonn Mallie that he was “very proud that I was a part of the IRA in Derry” but declined to say whether he had ever killed anyone.Last month, former IRA member Kieran Conway said that as the IRA’s chief of staff at the time of the attack which killed Lord Mountbatten and others, including two children, Mr McGuinness had to “take responsibility” for what had happened that day.Another former IRA man, Anthony McIntyre, said of that attack: “If they knew about the children, and were quite prepared to go ahead and to sacrice their lives in order to get Mountbatten, then it’s a war crime”.However, Sinn Féin MLA and former IRA man Raymond McCartney denounced such criticism of Mr McGuinness, saying that he was “held in the highest of esteem across Ireland and internationally”.The Foyle MLA said: “It is reprehensible that anyone would make unfounded allegations against a man who is no longer here to defend himself.”Spotlight on The Troubles – a Secret History involve two -minute programmes and five hour-long episodes. The series has been overseen by editor Jeremy Adams, deputy editor Gwyneth Jones and producer Chris Thornton. It involves three senior Spotlight reporters – Darragh MacIntyre, Jenner O’Leary and Mandy McAuley.The first programme will be broadcast on BBC One NI on Tuesday at .pm and will also be shown on BBC

#missed an opportunity# to improve RHI payments for boiler owners in Northern Ireland, a Westminster committee has said.Simon Hoare, the chairman of the NI Affairs Committee, said participants in the botched green energy scheme are getting a “raw deal” compared to boiler owners using a similar scheme in Great Britain.Earlier this year, the then secretary of state Karen Bradley rushed through legislation at Westminster in one day which retrospectively slashed the RHI subsidies in Northern Ireland.But in a statement yesterday, Mr Hoare’s committee said that in comparison with a similar scheme in GB, the repayment rate for the Northern Ireland scheme is based on “unrealistically low costing which results in unfair payments for participants”. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog

taken by boiler owners should be accounted for in the revised payments – had not been accepted by the Department for the Economy.And he urged the department to take steps to make the its scheme comparable to its counterpart in Great Britain.While he said he was pleased that senior civil servants had accepted some of the recommendations set out in a report by his committee, Mr Hoare added: “It is not enough to offer participants an acceptable way to get out of the scheme that takes into account indirect costs these costs must be built in to the payments offered by the scheme to make it comparable to the counterpart scheme in Great Britain. “RHI participants in Northern Ireland are getting a raw deal from this scheme and I will write to the Permanent Secretary to press the department for action to recty this.”New footage shows Martin McGuinness building car bomb and giving bullets to kids Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

out how much it costs  ","story":"Do you want to complain about a neighbour#s high hedge  It#s going to cost you five times more in the Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council area.That’s £ - five times more than any other area in NI, says AllianceCllr Eóin Tennyson.Cllr Tennysonsays the Council must make it easier for people to deal with high hedges.He said: “As it stands, where mediation fails in dealing with concerns around high hedges – which can often be a real nuisance and source of frustration and stress for people affected – raising an official complaint in the ABC area costs up to five times more than other areas in NI.“Often people dealing with high hedge disputes have no choice but to make an official complaint, which is why it is dficult to comprehend why ABC Council insists on charging applicants £ – adding financial strain to an already stressful situation.“While the fee is ed to the applicantthe complaint is upheld, this is still a large outlay which can be prohibitive for residents seeking resolution to a problem that has often been lingering for some time.“The fee is set by Councils, so while in other areas like Derry and Strabane Council it costs £ to pursue a complaint, I must question why the fee is so excessive for people to access the same service in the ABC area.“That’s why we are not only calling for a review of the costs of high hedge complaints in ABC Council, but have urged officers to advance the development of a mediation toolkit or resource to help resolve a greater number of disputes at an earlier stage.”A Council spokesperson said: “The matter of high hedges was raised at this week’s Environmental Services Committee. It was agreed that a report, which would include how the fee was set within the framework of the council’s fee setting policy and the investigation process, would be brought to next month’s Environmental Services Committee.”Princess Charlotte arrives for first day of school - accompanied by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
