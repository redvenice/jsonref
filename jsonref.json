[{"url":null,"title":"Venezuelas Guaid faces key test leadership vote","story":"Share this article Still, senior Maduro officials celebrated the bizarre gambit as a comeuppance for the 36-year-old lawmaker, who has been struggling to maintain unity in the unwieldy opposition coalition.Meanwhile, Parra, exercising his would-be authority, called a session for Tuesday, raising the possibility of rival claims to the legislature\u0027s leadership in the days ahead. A year ago, Guaidó asserted at a street demonstration that he was Venezuela\u0027s interim president in place of the \u0027usurper\u0027 Maduro, whose 2018 re-election has been rejected by the U.S., European Union and several Latin American governments.There was no indication of weakening support among the more than 50 governments that back recognize Guaidó as Venezuela\u0027s rightful leader. Brazil\u0027s government called the session an \u0027affront to democracy,\u0027 while the top-ranking U.S. diplomat in Latin America called Sunday\u0027s events in the chamber a \u0027farce.\u0027\u0027This morning´s phony National Assembly session lacked a legal quorum. There was no vote,\u0027 Assistant Secretary of State Michael Kozak said on Twitter.       National Assembly President Juan Guaido, Venezuela\u0027s opposition leader, tries to climb the fence past National Guards to enter the compound of the Assembly, after he and other opposition lawmakers were blocked Guaidó said lawmakers would gather later Sunday at the headquarters of El Nacional - the country\u0027s last major opposition newspaper - where they are expected to ratify their support for him.Guaidó faced a major test in uniting articulating a new vision Sunday in his year-long campaign to remove Maduro. But his re-election for a second straight year as head of congress - the source of his legitimacy in the eyes of many in the world - had been widely expected.The weeks leading up to Sunday\u0027s vote were marked by tension, with the opposition denouncing a covert government campaign to intimidate and bribe lawmakers into voting against Guaidó.Parra is one of a small handful of lawmakers who recently broke with Guaidó and have since been expelled from their parties for alleged involvement in a corruption scandal involving allies of Maduro.Socialist lawmakers argued that Guaido\u0027s absence forced them to initiate their session without him. But all day, opposition lawmakers faced resistance by security forces who set up several barricades downtown.       National Assembly President Juan Guaido, Venezuela\u0027s opposition leader, argues with police as he and other lawmakers are stopped a few blocks from the Assembly At one checkpoint, security forces demanded that each lawmaker present their credentials, arguing they were under orders to deny entry to several lawmakers banned from carrying out their duties by the loyalist supreme court.\u0027Is your family in Venezuela?\u0027 Guaidó asked the young police officers, who stood firmly in silence.\u0027Today you´re complicit with the dictatorship, you´re complicit with those who are responsible for the hunger inside Venezuela,\u0027 he added.Support for Guaidó inside the opposition has taken a hit after several minority parties in November splintered off to create a separate bloc to negotiate directly with Maduro - something that Guaidó has refused, arguing that talks are simply a time-buying exercise aimed at keeping Maduro in power.The small group of opposition lawmakers who broke with Guaidó argue that in stubbornly sticking to a naive plan of removing Maduro by force, he has put his political ambitions above the needs of Venezuelans who have largely tuned out from the political fight while enduring an economy in shambles and under stiff U.S. sanctions.       Pro-government lawmakers hold up their fists and shout that Chavez lives, referring to late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez\u0027In 2019 you represented the hopes of the nation, but today you\u0027re its biggest deception,\u0027 said José Brito, one of the lawmakers who turned against Guaidó amid accusations they used their position to enrich themselves and do the bidding of Maduro.Guaidó declared presidential powers over Venezuela on January 23, 2019, saying Maduro\u0027s reelection was illegitimate because the most popular opposition parties and political leaders had been disqualified from running.Venezuela sits atop vast oil and mineral resources, but it has been imploding economically and socially in recent years. Critics blame the plunge on years of failed socialist rule and corruption, while Maduro\u0027s allies say U.S. sanctions are taking a toll on the economy. The South American nation\u0027s 30 million people suffer soaring inflation and shortages of gasoline, running water and electricity, among basic services.       Lawmaker José Brito speaks to the press outside the National Assembly. Brito is a critic of Guaido       The opposition-controlled National Assembly is expected to decide whether to keep Guaidó as its leader for a second year in a special session        Guaido later opened a parliamentary session on Sunday at the offices of the El Nacional newspaper after being denied entry to the National Assembly An estimated 4.5 million Venezuelans have abandoned their nation in an exodus rivaling war-torn Syria.Maduro, who took over after the 2013 death of former President Hugo Chávez, says Guaidó is a puppet of the United States. Maduro also says he\u0027s determined to win control of the National Assembly in elections later this year.\u0027Despite perversions of the imperialist United States against Venezuela during 2019, we´ve managed to hold onto our independence, peace and stability,\u0027 Maduro tweeted recently.The two men remain locked in a power struggle. However, Maduro maintains military backing and control over most branches of the government, despite the deepening crisis and hard-hitting financial sanctions from the United States.\u0027Guaidó will have to not only re-energize his base and convince them to stay engaged, but keep his coalition in line as well,\u0027 said Geoff Ramsey, a researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u0027And the clock is ticking.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Vandals SAW legs Zlatan Ibrahimovic statue Swedish hometown Malmo","story":"Share this article   Malmo deputy mayor Frida Trollmyr said: \u0027I can understand that many people are disappointed in Zlatan\u0027s behaviour but vandalising a statute is simply unworthy.\u0027Better to express your dissatisfaction in a democratic way.\u0027But she added a citizens\u0027 initiative to move the sculpture will be considered in February.

If anybody out there deserved killing, it was Qassem Soleimani.\u0027But Mr Crocker said he was \u0027concerned\u0027 about the White House\u0027s failure to warn allies of its controversial decision to kill Mr Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad last week.He said: \u0027Britain is and has been for a number of years our foremost ally.

Boris Berezovsky was found hanged in 2013. Some have claimed he was murdered but police disagree\u0027He really helped Berezovsky splash his cash in the UK and pursued a whole range of highly risky property deals for Berezovsky in Russia itself.\u0027So he exposed himself to huge danger as part of that role and ultimately he plunged from a window from his fourth-floor apartment in Marylebone, in London and was impaled on the spikes of a wrought iron fence underneath.\u0027This after warning police and his friends and family for years that he was being targeted by Russian hitmen.\u0027  Ms Blake also claims that Young\u0027s money laundering career came after he robbed banks in Europe and found a way to bring it back to Britain without facing arrest.She said: ‘Scot Young met a lawyer on a Concorde flight from New York to London in the 1990s and told him: I\u0027ve got a tax problem. I\u0027ve been robbing banks all over Europe and whenever I try to spend the money I have made, in the UK, the taxman wants to know where it came from. Heidi, who is global investigations editor of Buzzfeed, went on: \u0027He was introduced to a barrister who advised him that money stolen in bank heists wasn\u0027t in the schedules of taxable income and the taxman couldn\u0027t tax you on the proceeds of crime.‘So if he went to HMRC and told them that he had stolen all this money, he wouldn\u0027t be taxed. The way the law worked at the time is that anything declarations you made voluntarily you did so with immunity so that tax authorities weren\u0027t able to notify the police that this money was stolen. \u0027So this is what Scot Young did, he moved all the money into a UK account, declared this was how he made it and the taxman let him get on with spending it\u0027. Scot was part of a group of five friends — all of whom attained huge riches on deals they brokered — who all met sudden, violent deaths within four years of each other.  They were property magnates Paul Castle and Robbie Curtis ex-rock manager Johnny Elichaoff and Berezovsky, found dead at his Berkshire home in 2013 with a ligature round his neck. Mr Young had told friends he was worried someone was going to try to kill him because here was ‘a price on his head’.He served eight months in prison in 2013 after a judge jailed him for contempt of court for failing to reveal the whereabouts of the £400million fortune that was at the centre of his seven-year orce battle with his wife.           Fall: Mr Young, pictured shortly before his death necking Krug Chanpagne, went bankrupt after he made his fortune \u0027fixing\u0027 deals for the super-rich but his wife says he hid huge sums of cash              Scot Young, picture with his American girlfriend Noelle Reno, was at the centre of one of Britain’s most acrimonious orce cases, with his wife Michelle, before he died          Boris Berezovsky at the £20million Surrey mansion which he bought from Scot Young before he diedDundee-born Scot made his riches in property and gambling on telecoms - but also reportedly made large sums working as a fixer for the super-rich. He himself lived a lavish lifestyle, riding around in luxury sports cars and wearing designer clothes.He married Michelle Young in 1995 and had two children, Scarlet and Sasha, living in a 12-bedroom, 200-acre plot in Surrey.Mrs Young had previously claimed that he was \u0027worth a few billion at least\u0027 and said her husband had hidden assets of more than £400million in offshore accounts.Things started to go sour in 2006 and a protracted orce battle ensued - with Scot agreeing to marry an American-born model.But this never happened as, in 2014, he was found impaled on railings in Montagu Square, London.The cause of his death has never been ascertained and an inquest in 2015 refused to label it as suicide.In 2017 it was revealed that Scotland Yard had received a transcript of a phone call between Mr and Mrs Young that took place five weeks before his death.In the call she said she had uncovered links between him and exiled Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky. But he warned her to stop investigating his contacts and his life was in danger.Scot Young helped hide his £500million fortune from his wife \u0027in a game of hide and concealment\u0027 after instructing a Panama-based law firm, leaked documents suggested in 2016.The British tycoon used Mossack Fonseca and other offshore businesses to stash his assets in Russia, the British Virgin Islands and Monaco. "},{"url":null,"title":"Dominos Pizza boss 23 sacked writing golliwog takeaway box","story":"Share this article \u0027He is embarrassed over what has happened.\u0027Hemingway, of Wrexham, was fined £600 with and ordered to pay £100 compensation, £85 costs and a £30 surcharge.Magistrates chair Andy Stubbs said: \u0027This is behaviour that has gone beyond banter.\u0027Some would say it was very childish behaviour in the workplace\u0027.MailOnline contacted Domino\u0027s for comment. "},{"url":null,"title":"Border Collie pup rushed surgery EATING rubber toy","story":"Share this article \u0027These swellings slow down healing and are more prone to infections.

The evolution of drone technology allows new ways of seeing, not possible even from the most manoeuvrable helicopter. The German photographer Tom Hegen has been a pioneer of such opportunities. Shooting directly downwards from a hovering near-stationary drone, he can flatten out perspective to the point that the Earth’s surface seems like a stretched canvas. His images of salt production landscapes in southern Europe give the sense that Google Earth has been hacked by abstract expressionist painters.This picture was taken above the pink lakes and white mountains of the salt industry at Aigues-Mortes near Montpellier in the south of France. Salt has been processed continuously from the marshes here since Roman times. To create table salt, seawater is channelled through 45 miles (70km) of intricate canals or roubines. The area is now restricted to visitors because of its unique ecosystem.Hegen says he was drawn to photograph here partly to document the brutal recasting of the landscape by centuries of human activity, and partly to capture the glorious geometries and colour contrasts. His picture is included in a new book, From Above: The Story of Aerial Photography. “I draw my inspiration from classic painters like Mark Rothko,” Hegen says. “I see all human beings as designers of our planet. And I see myself as a sort of framer, framing the artworks of the earth’s surface with my camera.”From Above: The Story of Aerial Photography by Eamonn McCabe and Gemma Padley is published by Laurence King (£40)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2ca60dea33303108dd5c939ae835f53f6c1a421/0_280_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d86b5880675bfcfeda780b5eff6471b","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"The drone strike in Baghdad, bushfires in Australia, the continuing unrest in Hong Kong and New Year celebrations – the best photography in news, culture and sport from around the world this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/949976fc53b187fa154ae48315a8366f02ff5068/0_722_9294_5577/master/9294.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d1177a5ce83fecad5bc3b615da5dbf3","title":"original observer photography","story":"Stormzy, Robert Pattinson, fashion and clowns – the best photography commissioned by the Observer in December 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b320210c8b0d5b8a2eb5aaedb32f14dec366ad6/0_409_5904_3543/master/5904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad76b37c68ab5e48b200dd4c4ffa51ae","title":"the playful modernism of designer george him in pictures","story":"Jerzy Himmelfarb was an acclaimed graphic designer in his native Poland and later Germany before changing his name to George Him and moving to London in 1937, where he stayed throughout the second world war. “He was influential as an advocate for the value of graphic design as a creative practice and a way to connect with people, says Olivia Ahmad, curator of a new exhibition of Him’s wartime propaganda posters, packaging design and children’s illustrations.

Private firms have also baulked at joining the stock market, which is considered a route to broader investments from pension funds, international investors and inidual savers.According to data firm Dealogic, just 34 companies applied to be listed in the UK over the last year, the lowest number since 2009. The amount of money raised from new UK listings nearly halved compared with the year before to £3.7bn.The decline in new listings and rise in the number of existing stock market listed firms quitting to go private is expected to accelerate a decline in the proportion of publicly listed companies, not just in London, but in most major stock markets.Pinsent Masons blamed Brexit uncertainties for depressing the value of UK-listed firms compared to their European counterparts and making them more attractive to foreign buyers.The rise in deals may also reflect management teams being more receptive to partnering with PE funds to take a company private, said the law firm. Managers may believe that public markets undervalue their companies and are therefore open to offers from PE funds, though a majority of shareholders must agree to any takeover bid.Julian Stanier, a partner at the law firm said: “The speed at which companies are going private principally boils down to depressed share prices, low interest rates and the massive firepower of Private Equity.“Attractive valuations have enabled PE funds to acquire companies with strong fundamentals at prices below recent norms. We expect to see this activity continue into 2020. A new government with a strong majority has further added to the attractiveness of UK companies,” he said.Stanier said record-low interest rates in the UK and Europe made it cheaper to fund deals. Also, private equity funds were “sitting on large amounts of capital which they are under pressure to deploy”.He said: “This has resulted in PE funds considering a wider range of opportunities in order to put investors’ money to work, including acquiring listed companies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbc640ba66324529916bf25b95755d0d34a4bf2f/0_236_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e5b6a33de2604b5ca5c643bdb7b15a3","title":"aldi sales christmas stores","story":"Retailer says it sold 55m mince pies and 22m pigs in blankets during festive seasonChristmas sales at Aldi topped £1bn for the first time as the German-owned retailer continued its rapid expansion in the UK.“Aldi must now face the fact that it can no longer hope to achieve the same domineering double-digit growth it has done over the past decade,” said Thomas Brereton, a retail analyst at GlobalData.Like-for-like sales have become the benchmark in the City for judging the current performance of retailers. Typically represented as percentage growth rates, like-for-like sales measure sales at stores that have been open for at least a year, stripping out the impact of sales at newer stores. The idea is that they allow a more transparent comparison of a retailer’s sales performance over a certain period of time, when compared with the same period of time a year earlier.However, there is no formal industry standard. This means that some companies include new extensions to stores in their like-for-like sales, while others include sales generated by a customer paying with a voucher. Critics of the measure say that like-for-like sales do not always give an accurate picture of a retailer’s health. They argue that of greater relevance is profitability and how well a company is adapting to challenges such as the living wage and online shopping revolution.Aldi has been rapidly opening stores as it aims to increase its UK chain from 874 shops to 1,200 by 2025. The growth has weighed on profits as it pours money into new stores and cutting prices to lift sales. Figures published in September showed that Aldi’s 2018 profits fell by almost a fifth as it invested £530m in expansion.Giles Hurley, the Aldi UK chief executive, said: “More customers than ever before shopped with us this Christmas.

This is generally interpreted as also avoiding products that are cooked with meat.The marketing director of the fast-food chain, Katie Evans, described the product as a “game-changer”.“We wanted our first plant-based Whopper to replicate the indulgence and flame-grilled taste of the real thing as closely as possible, and we’re thrilled with the result,” she said. “We’re delighted to satisfy the demand for this highly-anticipated product and finally bring the Rebel to the UK.”The burger, made in conjunction with meat-free food company the Vegetarian Butcher, has tomatoes, lettuce, mayonnaise, ketchup, pickles on a seeded bun, with a patty made from soy – a common meat substitute.Growing awareness of the impact of meat and dairy production on the climate has contributed to a spike in veganism in recent years, with the UN a long-standing advocate of reducing animal product consumption.Last year, 250,000 people pledged to go vegan in January, with vegan celebrities including Venus Williams, Zac Efron and Ariana Grande credited with raising the profile of the movement.The Rebel Whopper launch comes after Greggs’ debut of its vegan steak bake, a meat-substitute version of its popular pastry, in partnership with vegetarian food brand Quorn.The sandwich chain Subway has also made attempts to capitalise on a growing trend towards dairy, egg, and meat-free diets, adding a vegan marinara meatball sandwich to its offering , after launching a vegan patty in 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69c65ea49700762081ff4c2d4889838dc77a38ec/203_0_6496_3899/master/6496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4400f4b13a094cc89c239e54b8bfbc6","title":"oil prices 70 a barrel suleimani retaliation petrol price","story":"Rise in cost of crude after US attack on Iranian general could affect petrol priceOil prices have climbed above $70 a barrel for the first time in four months amid fears that the US air strike that killed Iran’s top military commander may trigger a retaliation.The attack has sent shockwaves through global markets, causing equity indices in Asia, the US and Europe to slump while the benchmark price of Brent crude climbed to its highest level since September.Iran has vowed to take revenge against the US for the assassination of Suleimani, who was one of the most powerful leaders in Iran, and the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force.The oil price continued to climb after Friday’s surge when the US warned over the weekend that Iran might retaliate by targeting oil facilities in the Middle East, which could disrupt global oil supplies and drive prices higher.A prolonged oil price surge could raise the risk of a global economic recession and would add about 2p a litre to the price of petrol at the pumps.However, market analysts at Goldman Sachs and UBS have cast doubt on whether oil prices will continue to rally beyond $70 a barrel because of strong production from outside the Middle East.UBS expects the global oil market to be oversupplied this year because of rising production from the US and Norway, which would keep prices from rising above $70.Paul Donovan, the chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said the global market’s focus on the oil price after the attack is “a rather 1970s reaction” that is “perhaps not appropriate for 2020”.The oil price spike to more than $70 a barrel after a Saudi oil refinery facility was attacked last September proved short-lived, with the price retreating to less than $65 within days.“More serious economic damage may come if there is cyber retaliation – which seems suited to this situation – or from general uncertainty,” Donovan said.The geopolitical jitters have triggered a surge in the market price for gold, which asset managers typically consider a safe haven in times of turmoil.The market price for gold rose to a near seven-year high of $1,575 an ounce as global equity markets fell and analysts expect the price could climb higher if the US dollar weakens relative to other currencies.A spokesman for the RAC said a prolonged oil price rally would add “at least 2p” per litre to the price of petrol, weeks after the first rise in six months in December.The average price of a litre of petrol rose by almost 0.25p in December to 126.1p, according to the RAC. Motorists are paying more for the fuel because of a combination of rising oil market prices and the cost of meeting EU rules to include more biofuels in petrol and diesel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd5ef6d7c7a250fe4dca95a4b7e301f880503faf/0_245_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02ff7b6bb48fbaacadbfe30e1855ae1e","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of pure","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘pure’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘pure’.Share your photos of what pure means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 8 January at 10am.

July to October is a great time to see pods of migrating mothers with their calves and, if you’re feeling languid, the Marine Hotel is perfectly situated on a clifftop overlooking the ocean, so you’ll be able to spot barnacle-clad beasts from your balcony.A 40-minute trundle down the road, you’ll find Gansbaai. Known by locals as the Serengeti of the sea, the waters here are bristling with sea creatures, including the marine big five: whales, dolphins, seals, penguins and sharks. The latter can be seen in their menacing masses in Shark Alley – a sliver of ocean that roils with cape fur seals, the great white’s favourite prey.It’s a four-hour journey from Gansbaai to Oudtshoorn, but you’ll have plenty of screensaver scenery to gawp at along the way, including the craggy Tradouw mountain pass and the twisty-turny Huisrivier pass, which clings to the side of a mountain where cape leopards still roam. As well as the Cango Caves – an impressive prehistoric limestone system, dripping with troll-like rock formations, stalagmites and stalactites – Oudtshoorn boasts the largest number of ostriches in the world, with many of the farms offering tractor rides or walks out in the fields with the colossal birds.Head almost due south towards the coast and you’ll soon reach Knysna – a charming holiday town right at the heart of the Garden Route. Here, you’ll find a vast aquamarine lagoon spilling out into the ocean from between two huge sandstone headlands, helpfully known as the Heads. Hike through the lush forest – thought of as the lungs of this beautiful town – or take a trip out on to the water where you can fish, kayak, water ski and swim.A half-hour drive east is Plettenberg Bay. Home to the rocky Robberg Nature Reserve – where you can snorkel with rambunctious seals – a satisfyingly sandy central beach and the Nelson Bay caves, which date back to the stone age. This is also a great place to take part in a township tour (run by Ocean Blue Adventures). Meet up with a local from the Qolweni community and join them on a visit to the township’s Siyakhula crèche, the central shebeen and other lively spots, meeting some of the friendly locals and learning about the township’s rich history along the way. Come evening, stay at the remarkable Tsala Treetop Lodge just out of town – a collection of elegant elevated hideaways decked out in Afro-baroque style and hidden among the canopy of the ancient indigenous forest.Locals like to call Tsitsikamma, just north of Storms River – “the garden of the Garden Route”. An old Khoisan word, Tsitsikamma means “place of much water”, and whether it’s the yawning river valleys, the flinty ocean or the dew-daubed forest that clings to the mountains, this place is most certainly lush. Don your hiking boots for a lung-cleansing hike around this beautiful landscape, then make your final drive to Storms River, where – if the mood strikes – you can mark the end of your epic road trip by hurling yourself off the Bloukrans Bridge – the world’s highest bridge to bungee off.How to bookWith direct flights from London to Cape Town, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

This is also how the UK and continental Europe accesses a lot of email, social media, online shopping, Netflix and other internet services. “Everything with the word smart in front of it has a data centre behind it,” said Ben Bryan, Digital Realty’s technical operations manager in Dublin.But there is a catch. The surge in Irish data processing will require significant new energy infrastructure and increase emissions, complicating Ireland’s response to the climate crisis. The cloud can create carbon: it is estimated that when the music video Despacito reached 5bn streamed YouTube views in 2018, the energy consumption was equivalent to powering 40,000 US homes a year (it has now exceeded 6.5bn views).It is already Europe’s data centre capital, with Amazon, Google and Microsoft siting operations there. Dozens of centres have opened in recent years, bringing the total to 54, with a combined power capacity of 642MW. Once a leading exporter of floppy discs and CD-Roms, Ireland has successfully transitioned to the big data era.It is just the beginning. With the state’s blessing another 10 centres are under construction, including a €1bn (£845m) Amazon hub in Mulhuddart, west Dublin, that together will add 202MW. Another 31 centres have planning permission, which would add 629MW. There has been one setback: planning approval delays prompted Apple to scrap a planned €850m (£743m) centre last year.“The data centre industry is growing so fast it’s hard to fathom,” said Patrick Bresnihan, a geography professor at Maynooth University in Ireland. “But somehow the tech companies get far less attention than aviation or fossil fuel companies.”Ireland faces a dilemma. The expanding web of data centres is part of a strategy to anchor tech companies that drive economic growth. They have been designated as “critical infrastructure”, facilitating planning approval. “Data centre presence in Ireland raises our visibility internationally as a technology-rich, innovative economy,” said a spokesperson for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DoBEI).But the boom will exact a price. Ireland is one of the EU’s worst carbon emission offenders and faces fines of more than €250m for missing 2020 targets on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Missing later targets will trigger steeper fines.Ireland’s data centres have a low profile. They tend to operate from anonymous-looking business parks with high-security perimeter fences and intruder detection alarms. A Google centre has colourful murals but the rest are grey and nondescript, with discreet signage.Digital Realty, whose headquarters is in San Francisco, has a relatively small centre in Profile Park, part of a cluster in west Dublin. Its two data halls are powered by 9MW, a fraction of some neighbours but enough to require an electricity substation.It powers the servers and fans which during winter suck in cool air from outside. If the power – and cooling – stopped the machines would swiftly overheat, said Bryan. That has never happened but just in case there are backup diesel generators on the roof.Google and Amazon representatives also said their Irish data centres were energy efficient and entirely supplied by – or soon would be - renewable energy. Earlier this year Amazon Web Services announced backing for a 91.2MW windfarm in Donegal and a 23.2MW windfarm in Cork.Such deals could act as a catalyst for renewable energy investment, said the DoBEI, citing a 2018 government report.Asked about the estimated 1.5m tonnes of carbon emissions, it replied: “The department is not in a position to comment on the accuracy or otherwise of the estimates of the IAE study, which it is not a party to.”Bresnihan, the academic, said Ireland’s dependence on big tech companies should not obscure their environmental cost. “If they left Ireland would be in a pretty bad situation but there’s only so long you can put off these contradictions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c4174154230067551a22ec1dde4dcfce8235b41/0_148_4521_2713/master/4521.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=983260f3126d5dfa0b400ce974c8522f","title":"london fashion week grace wales bonner 70s london reggae","story":"Designer who dressed Duchess of Sussex drew on classic designs and colours of Rastafarian flagLovers Rock, the reggae genre popular in London in the 70s and 80s, had an unexpected moment in the fashion spotlight on Sunday night at the capital’s menswear shows. Grace Wales Bonner, a much hyped designer who has dressed the Duchess of Sussex, dedicated her London fashion week collection to the music, and the scene that surrounded it over 40 years ago.Linley Hall, a grand building in equally grand SW1, was transformed into a homage to a youth centre. Guests including the artist Isaac Julien, the footballer Héctor Bellerín and poet Wilson Oryema sat at round tables, and fruit punch and Jamaican patties were offered as refreshments. In the show notes provided, Wales Bonner explained that she was inspired, in part, by John Goto’s photographs of second-generation British Caribbean and Asian young people at Lewisham youth centre for Lovers Rock parties. The soundtrack – put together by Jamie XX – was blasted out of speaker stacks, as it might have when these images were taken.The collection stuck close to the theme. It began with a crisp wool suit with a poloneck – a classically 70s combination, but with a minimalism that did away with any accusations of retro. Across women’s and menswear, trenchcoats, knits, tracksuit trousers and donkey jackets followed, along with shirts printed with paintings by British-Guyanese artist Frank Bowling.The red, gold and green of the Rastafarian flag were used on hats, vests and coats. All the clothes felt modern despite the references. This is one of Wales Bonner’s strengths. While her references are so academic that she provides a bibliography for each collection, she is able to translate her area of historical interest – be it Lovers Rock, Howard University in the 60s, or the court dress of Haile Selassie – into clothes that people want to wear.After the show, Wales Bonner – a somewhat serene presence in the usually frenetic world of a fashion show – explained that the inspiration for this show had been, as she put it, “inevitable” because of its proximity to her own background, and her Jamaican father’s experiences in London in the 70s. “I was thinking a lot about people coming into community centres and creating their own parties,” she said. “I was looking at John Goto’s Lovers Rock series and saw my family reflected in it.”Last year was a big one for Wales Bonner, starting with the curation of an exhibition at London’s Serpentine Gallery in January. She also won the BFCVogue Fashion Fund prize – an investment of £200,000 – in May. The designer’s pedigree is writ large in the company she keeps. The white coat-dress worn by the Duchess of Sussex to present her son in May was Wales Bonner’s, and she collaborated with Christian Dior’s Maria Grazia Chuiri on items for the megabrand’s cruise collection in April. She also partnered with Solange on a performance art happening, Devotional Sound, in New York.Wales Bonner highlights the work of other people of colour excelling in their field. Recent posts on her Instagram include a clip of poet London Kwesi Johnson reciting his piece Inglan is a Bitch in 1980, Bowling paintings, and a notice of a talk between Wales Bonner and artist Theaster Gates, for his show at the Tate Liverpool. Scroll further down and you’ll find musicians including Steve Lacy and Jorja Smith wearing her designs. It’s perhaps part of a wider vision for the designer’s label.“It is my ambition to build a brand that comes from a black cultural perspective and has the same authority, presence and impact as any esteemed European house,” she said to Vogue in May. “In the long term, I want Wales Bonner to exist on that same level.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9563bb8e38b239590d2fb02fce182641bb2c354/0_338_5347_3210/master/5347.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7e34b0e2557d464173e0a8bbdf5ba93","title":"the 2020 golden globes fashion on the red carpet in pictures","story":"Billy Porter, Jennifer Aniston, Cynthia Erivo, Jennifer Lopez and more flaunt big sleeves and long trains at the 77th edition of the film and television awards"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb31197c22a80f4812b4bd013b244a04a9a24103/0_45_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69e30fd4a1f579ca80de6a2e877d383b","title":"golden globes 2020 1917 and fleabag lead british invasion with major wins","story":"The first big awards show of the year saw British victories across the board, including for Olivia Colman, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Sam MendesIt was a night of stratospherically high star-wattage – Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Taylor Swift, Beyonce, Elton John, the list goes on – and big wins for British productions at the 77th Golden Globes, a night overstuffed with largely unsurprising awards, host Ricky Gervais’s apathy toward award shows, and calls to vote in 2020.Top of the British victory wave was 1917, Sam Mendes’s technically audacious film following two British soldiers in the first world war, which won for best picture – drama and best director. Best actor – drama, meanwhile, went to Joaquin Phoenix for Joker, who gave a rambling speech frequently obscured with network bleeps. Renee Zellweger won best actress in a drama for Judy. On the comedymusical side, the night tipped in favor of Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and its supporting actor star Brad Pitt, as well as Brit Taron Egerton for his portrayal of Sir Elton John in Rocketman.It was also a night of historic firsts with The Farewell star Awkwafina becoming the first Asian-American woman to win for best actress in a musical or comedy (“If I fall on hard times, I can sell this,” joked the first-time Golden Globes attendee) and composer Hildur Guðnadóttir winning best score for Joker, becoming the first woman to win solo in the category.On the television side, the Globes extended the Emmys’ British invasion with numerous wins for stars from across the pond – Phoebe Waller-Bridge continued her awards season roll with best actress and best comedy for Fleabag, Olivia Colman ruled again for her takeover of Queen Elizabeth II in The Crown, and Brian Cox triumphed as best actor in a drama for Succession, whose British creator Jesse Armstrong picked up a win for best drama series. Uncharacteristically for the Globes, the television wins largely tracked with critical acclaim or consensus besides wins for the much-lauded Fleabag and Succession, awards went to the well-reviewed Chernobyl and its star Stellan Skarsgaard for supporting actor in a limited series, and what could be seen as a “best new artist” award to Ramy Youssef for his role in Hulu’s small but mighty series Ramy.Blasting stars’ enthusiasm to work for massive streaming companies, Gervais told the crowd to not use their speeches “as a platform to make a political speech”, and instead “come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and God, and fuck off”.Several of the winners pointedly ignored Gervais’s advice the night’s two most rousing speeches belonged to veteran speech-givers Patricia Arquette and Michelle Williams. Arquette, accepting for a repeat win as best supporting actress in a limited series for The Act, urged viewers to look past the pomp toward real issues. “While I love my kids so much, I beg of us all to give them a better world,” she said. “For our kids and their kids we have to vote in 2020 and we have to get – beg and plead for everyone we know to vote in 2020.”Williams, accepting for best actress in limited series for FosseVerdon, built on her memorable Emmys speech on giving space for women to do their best work with a moving call for women’s right to choose. “I’ve tried my very best to live a life of my own making and not just a series of events that happened to me, but one that I can stand back and look at and recognize my handwriting all over,” she said – choices not possible without her right, as a woman, to “choose when to have my children and with whom, when I felt supported and able to balance our lives, knowing, as all mothers know, the scales must and will tip towards our children”. She concluded by calling on women “18 to 118”, to vote in their self-interest, because “it’s what men have been doing for years, which is why the world looks so much like them – but don’t forget we are the largest voting body in this country. Let’s make it look more like us.”The night’s other most resonant speeches belonged to the evening’s two lifetime honorees: Ellen Degeneres, accepting the Carol Burnett award for achievement in television from Kate McKinnon, who described the impact the comedian’s coming out had on her as a young woman, and America’s great everyman, Tom Hanks, introduced for the Cecil B DeMille by Charlize Theron as, simply, a man who “makes the world a better place”.Phoenix also took a political, if slightly less coherent than Arquette and Williams, stance in his speech. “It’s really nice that so many people have sent their well wishes to Australia but we have to do more than that,” he said, referencing the country’s devastating bush fires. “I have not always been a virtuous man. So many of you in this room have given me so many opportunities to get it right … Together, hopefully we can be unified and make some changes,” such as, he added, not taking a private jet to Palm Springs.The climate change-fueled disaster in Australia received much attention throughout the night best supporting actor in a limited series Russell Crowe wasn’t in attendance due to the fires, sending word instead to take climate action seriously, while Aussie native Cate Blanchett thanked well-wishers and urged for donations to first responders and those affected by the raging bushfires, because “when one country faces a climate disaster, we all face a climate disaster”.Even Gervais had to agree, ending the night with a call to “get drunk, take your drugs, and also: donate to Australia.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/488366c6340eee4886977be75cbec5e90444265a/0_124_3672_2203/master/3672.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35c36d959b4cde2cb95d9212acb71704","title":"harvey weinstein trial new york metoo movement","story":"The trial, which begins 6 January, will include testimony from two alleged victims and Annabella Sciorra amid concerns he may not be ultimately held legally accountableHarvey Weinstein is set to face his toughest legal challenge yet – a criminal trial for rape and sexual assault that could send him to prison for the rest of his life.Only a handful of women will be allowed to testify at the trial in New York supreme court in Manhattan, which begins on 6 January. But watching from the sidelines will be scores of women who have alleged sexual misconduct and abuse at the hands of Weinstein.In the New York trial, the 67-year-old movie producer is accused of raping a longtime lover, who has not been publicly named, in 2013, and of forcibly performing oral sex on his production assistant in 2006. The trial will include testimony from these two alleged victims, as well as from Sopranos actor Annabella Sciorra, who said Weinstein raped her at her apartment in the early 1990s.The alleged 1993 incident was initially deemed too old to be considered as evidence, but was recently admitted under the legal theory that the testimony could help support charges of predatory sexual assault, which carry a maximum life sentence and requires prosecutors to show a pattern of misconduct.The prosecution will attempt to prove that Weinstein is guilty of all five counts brought before the court, including two counts of predatory sexual assault, one count of a criminal sexual act in the first degree, one count of rape in the first degree and one count of rape in the third degree. Sciorra’s allegation cannot be charged separately, according to prosecutors.Weinstein has denied all wrongdoing, saying any sex that took place was consensual.Zoë Brock, a former model and writer from New Zealand who was part of that civil settlement, told the  that watching proceedings will be agonizing.“I’m heartbroken that I won’t have the opportunity to face him in court myself. I’m really disappointed. It’s been devastating,” said Brock, who has alleged Weinstein made unwanted sexual advances in a hotel room in 1997, forcing her to lock herself in the bathroom to escape.“I can definitely paint a picture that he was aided and abetted by people who worked for him, and some of the people who worked for him admitted to my face that he did it repeatedly.”The trial comes two years after New York Times and New Yorker investigations into widespread allegations of sexual abuse and harassment by Weinstein helped galvanise the #MeToo era – and a year after his arrest in 2018, when he was released on $1m bail.It also comes amid concerns that though Weinstein’s fall from Hollywood royalty to criminal defendant was a watershed cultural moment, he may not ultimately be held legally accountable for most of his alleged conduct.Such concerns were heightened in December, following reports that the Weinstein Company had reached a tentative $25m settlement deal in a civil case with more than 30 alleged sexual misconduct victims, which would not require Weinstein to admit any wrongdoing or pay anything out of his own pocket to his accusers.Weinstein’s lawyers insist he is innocent and will only need to sow doubt in the jurors’ minds since it’s up to the prosecution to meet the burden of proof, which is higher for criminal cases than civil ones.“Mr Weinstein maintains that all of these allegations are false, and he expects to be fully vindicated,” Weinstein lawyer Benjamin Brafman said in a statement. The road to the trial has been long and gruelling. In October 2018, Weinstein lawyers got one of six criminal sex charges dismissed. But the defense subsequently failed to get other charges against Weinstein dropped in December 2018, after the judge ruled the court had found “no basis for the defendant’s claim of prosecutorial or law enforcement misconduct”.Last summer, prosecutors obtained a new indictment allowing for Sciorra to testify – a move a Weinstein’s lawyers called “desperate”. Weinstein’s lawyers faced another setback in October when the defense lost its bid to move the trial to another city: the court rejected the former producer’s concern that he wouldn’t get a fair trial in what his lawyers referred to as the “circus-like atmosphere” of media in New York. Unlike other high-profile court cases in the US, this trial will not be televised.﻿“I’m trying as much as I can to brace myself for the worst possible scenario,” the actor Katherine Kendall, one of the first women to speak out against Weinstein, told the . “And at the same time I feel really hopeful because this is a historic moment and it feels like the message could get out there to people that your stories matter and the judicial system will do something about it.”Kendall came forward as part of the New York Times’ initial investigation into Weinstein, alleging he harassed her in 1993. She has since sought out therapeutic resources, like the trauma workshops led by fellow Weinstein accuser Louise Godbold.“If this man walks free it is not just an insult to those of us who have lost friends, families, careers as a result of coming forward with the truth,” Godbold told the , “but it is sending a dangerous predator back into the world.”The former actor and screenwriter Louisette Geiss emphasized her frustration with the limited scope of the criminal trial. “In the class action we know of 150 women he’s affected,” Geiss told the .A mother to four, Geiss left Hollywood for real estate after she said Weinstein tried to make her to watch him masturbate in front of her as she was pitching a movie at the Sundance film festival in 2008.She now serves as co-chair of the $25m civil settlement against Weinstein and the Weinstein Company.“We all know that the court of public feelings are very important around these decisions and if he’s seen as this poor guy … that’s not going to fly,” she said, in reference to his recent media appearances.Weinstein has begun appearing with a walker, and while recovering from spinal surgery, he granted a rare photo opportunity and interview to the New York Post.“I feel like the forgotten man,” he told the Post. “I made more movies directed by women and about women than any film-maker, and I’m talking about 30 years ago. I’m not talking about now when it’s vogue. I did it first! I pioneered it!”Weinstein has said he sustained a serious back injury in a car accident in August last year. But some are skeptical of the optics of his interview.“He’s a wealthy man – he knows how to do PR for himself … So it is very important for us since we can’t be on the stand to make sure we let America know what a bad guy he is,” Geiss said.Things will only more heated once the trial begins on Monday, a housekeeping day when the judge will outline the schedule, and it’s expected to drag on for weeks. Jury selection is set to begin on Tuesday, and jurors have been told to prepare for a case lasting up to two months.The Los Angeles district attorney’s office is considering whether to bring charges in eight separate cases against Weinstein. London’s politan police force continues to investigate allegations of misconduct. But for now, all eyes are on the New York trial.“Considering every other horrific thing that happened so far in this criminal case with Harvey, I now live in the worst-case scenario,” Brock said.“The system is broken,” Brock continued. “And therefore no, I do not feel confident any more that the right thing will happen because life is not a Spielberg movie. I wish it was.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acc739aebffec70b1e40073b2a3cd8472c2d60f8/0_6_4442_2664/master/4442.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd03c74e95d5ea59cfe462c55ad618fb","title":"ricky gervais targets apple epstein and cats in golden globes monologue","story":"The controversial host returns to the Golden Globes with a monologue skewering everyone from Felicity Huffman to Joe PesciWith a drink in hand and an immediate promise that this would not happen again, Ricky Gervais kicked off his fifth time hosting the Golden Globes with a monologue skewering, among others: Twitter callouts, Felicity Huffman, Jeffrey Epstein, and award season’s moralizing speeches.The controversial British comedian, 58, promised before the show he’d go after “the general community. I’d go after cinema and I’d go after television and I’d go after actors and I’ll go after pretension and hypocrisy,” and for the most part, stuck to his promise. “Let’s have a laugh at your expense, shall we?” he said. “Remember, they’re just jokes, we’re all going to die soon.”Known for drawing audience gasps and Twitter outrage for his jokes – his 2016 bit on Caitlyn Jenner’s transition and her car crash in which another driver died drew particular ire – Gervais trained most of his scorn this year on the Hollywood industry. He traveled to the show in a limo, for instance, though his had a “license plate that was made by Felicity Huffman,” a reference to her trial over illegally buying her child’s way into college.From there Gervais stayed generally true to his don’t-care beat, sending up Hollywood’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein (“I know he’s your friend, but I don’t care”), Leonardo DiCaprio’s dating life (he attended The Irishman’s premiere and “by the end, his date was too old for him”) and Hollywood film and TV executives who are “all terrified of Ronan Farrow – he’s coming for you.”Gervais had some predictably uncomfortable bits: calling talk show host James Corden a “fat pussy” and a bleeped-out joke about Dame Judi Dench lifting her leg and licking ... something, but saved his most biting words for the industry’s moneymakers. “You say you’re woke but the companies you work for – Apple, Amazon, Disney – if Isis started a streaming service, you would call your agent, wouldn’t you?” he said, referencing Apple TV+’s The Morning Show’s theme of morality, “which is rich coming from a company that runs sweat shops in Asia”.“So if you do win an award tonight, don’t use it as a platform to make a political speech, right?” he continued. “You’re in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world.”Noting that most people in the room “spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg”, Gervais capped his monologue with a caustic edict to the winners: “If you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and God, and fuck off.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97dc7001d517415e41f4800341ceaa53ef8ec258/0_95_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c461824c135c8f20ab3c17cb1a45b25f","title":"harvey weinstein trial metoo movement","story":"The trial is likely to be one of the most high-profile judicial events of the century, and will be closely watched by thousandsThe rape trial of the fallen movie mogul Harvey Weinstein begins on Monday in a Manhattan courtroom, opening a critical new chapter in the #MeToo movement that seeks justice for victims of alleged sexual assault at the hands of powerful men.Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty to five counts that include raping a woman in a New York hotel room in 2013 and forcing another woman to engage in oral sexual conduct in 2006. The most serious charge, to which the film producer has also pleaded not guilty, is predatory sexual assault, carrying a maximum sentence of life in prison.The trial is likely to be one of the most high-profile judicial events of the century, given a cast of characters drawn from Hollywood’s high table. It also comes with huge stakes for so many people.They include more than 80 women who have lined up to accuse Weinstein of sexual misconduct allegedly occurring over decades, including the actors Rosanna Arquette, Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan and Gwyneth Paltrow. The case is also of intimate importance to the wider community of those who have endured sexual harassment in the workplace.For them, the #MeToo movement triggered by the Weinstein revelations that emerged in October 2017 has become a driving force for change. The trial will be closely watched by thousands as a sign of the enduring strength – or otherwise – of their fledgling cause.For Weinstein, too, the stakes could not be higher. Though his fall has been dramatic since the publication of the first women’s stories by the New York Times and the New Yorker two years ago, he has so far avoided any personal punishment accruing from the many civil lawsuits that have been launched against him.Last month a $25m settlement was reached involving more than 30 women. But to the dismay of some of the women, the deal did not touch Weinstein’s own money or require him to admit guilt.The most perilous charge for Weinstein is predatory sexual assault. For that to secure a guilty verdict, the prosecutors will have to convince the jury the movie producer engaged in a pattern of sexual crimes over time.As part of the evidence on that count, the judge in the New York county supreme court, James Burke, has indicated he will allow three other women to testify including Sopranos actor Annabella Sciorra who alleges Weinstein sexually assaulted her in her apartment in 1993. Though that incident is beyond the statute of limitations and cannot be prosecuted in itself, it can be presented as evidence of alleged predatory behavior.The trial will begin with several days of jury selection. To the public, this phony-war stage of the proceedings, which could last as long as two weeks, will provide little information of interest. But it could be vital to both defense and prosecution parties.Weinstein’s lawyers, who tried unsuccessfully to have the trial moved out of New York on grounds that America’s media capital could not guarantee him a fair hearing given his hostile representation in the press, will be looking to weed out from the final jury anyone who harbors #MeToo feelings of revenge towards the defendant.Prosecutors will be scouring the social media histories of potential jurors to filter out anyone with prejudged opinions that #MeToo has gone too far or that it is subjecting men to unfair treatment.Each side will be able to remove up to three potential jurors without giving any reason – a system known as “preemptory strikes”.As the backdrop to the trial, the unspoken element in the courtroom will be the epic figure that Weinstein once presented as one of the titans of modern independent film-making. The production company he formed with his brother Bob Weinstein, Miramax (later the Weinstein Company), has legendary titles in its back catalogue such as Sex, Lies, and Videotape, Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love.Another element in the courtroom will be the many actors whose careers and fortunes Weinstein helped to forge. For the women among them, a question that is certain to be raised in trial proceedings is whether their stellar promotion by Weinstein and all the fame and riches it brought them came at a terrible price."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc56186c93fb8693d6108259bff8dd503545036f/0_93_1987_1192/master/1987.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8b172fbb74e20fcf762e53d018f9825","title":"ricky gervais is wrong political engagement at the golden globes was essential","story":"Stars such as Russell Crowe, Michelle Williams and Joaquin Phoenix were right to ignore his request – the time for silence on issues more pressing than showbiz has long passed“You know nothing about the real world,” Ricky Gervais told the audience at Sunday night’s Golden Globe awards. “Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg.” Should you win an award, he advised, “thank your agent and your God and fuck off.”Yet what unfolded at this year’s ceremony was a mass rejection of such apoliticism, with winner after winner using the stage as a platform for speaking up about, variously, climate change, abortion rights, democratic inclusivity, LGBT visibility, the dubiousness of Facebook’s ad checking policies.In theory, of course, Gervais is correct. Hollywood stars are obviously out of touch. However wryly intended, Joaquin Phoenix’s request that people think twice before from taking their private jet to Palm Springs wouldn’t have struck a chord with more than a dozen people in the room, and may have alienated many at home.But he’s mistaken if he believes the scepticism us plebs feel for Hollywood isn’t bound up not just with revulsion at its excesses but because everyday news currently trumps it time and time again for horrific drama – and wild comedy. A speech in which an actor remained wholly inside their bubble would now be far worse than one in which they acknowledged that bubble was expensively insulated within a burning building, in a city on fire.Political speeches used to be a turn-off, but that was when A-listers’ calls for action were largely in-house. However much they were at pains to link Hollywood’s problems with gender parity or racial bias or sexual harassment to the wider world, their anxieties always felt like first world concerns.This year, no one talked about the troubles in Tinseltown. Not even they care anymore. When Patricia Arquette called for wage equality in her 2014 Oscar acceptance speech, she was hailed as groundbreakingly radical. We have all moved on. This year Arquette spoke about “young people risking their lives”, “people not knowing if bombs are going to drop on their kids’ heads”, then begged everyone to try and “give our children a better world”.Gervais’s call for silence on what everyone is talking about marked another way in which his presence felt like a throwback to a previous era certainly a time before last year’s Oscars, when the necessity of the Kevin Hart implosion meant the ceremony went host-less – to unanimous acclaim.However clever or irreverent, the presence of one man telling us all how it’s going to go simply no longer sits easily. And, three hours after his initial instruction, even Gervais seemed more in the mood to ignore it. Introducing Sandra Bullock to announce the final award, he said: “Our next presenter starred in Netflix’s Bird Box, a movie where people survive by acting like they don’t see a thing. Sort of like working for Harvey Weinstein.”This was a considerable escalation of the acid reserved for the people in the room, less than a day before Weinstein’s trial is set to start. Gervais’s final words did not relate to Hollywood, however. They were: “Please donate to Australia.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718e198fcb121dcf2c06c83a3bea5f7eef8455b3/0_185_3690_2214/master/3690.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1e63f7aadee5d36ba38bad5c17a2e91","title":"golden globes 2020 the winners the losers the return of ricky gervais live","story":"Fleabag and 1917 were big winners in a night that saw Ricky Gervais try to offend the Hollywood eliteIt was a rather lacklustre night at the Globes, a shame for a star-packed ceremony that can often be rather loose and fun, despite some wacky choices. There were less alcohol-fuelled antics and although host Ricky Gervais kept promising to set fire to the rich and famous, all he did was throw a wet sparkler.The awards themselves were a mixed bag but one with more treats than tricks with some deserved small screen prizes for Fleabag, Succession and Chernobyl and some pleasing wins for Sam Mendes, Renee Zellweger and Awkwafina on the big screen. Interestingly, one of the biggest contenders of the night, The Irishman, went home empty-handed and its backer Netflix almost did the same, scooping up just two awards from its 34 nominations.By the end the night told or reinforced to us a number of things: being an awards show host remains a thankless task, 1917 is a genuine best picture contender at the Oscars and Michelle Williams gives a more convincing speech than most politicians. For now, it’s over but awards season has just begun. Aaaaand here’s the full news wrap:Here’s another one of the night’s most emotive speeches in case you haven’t yet seen:It’s not just Gervais who critics are faulting but the event itself. Here’s Vanity Fair’s Richard Lawson:“What are the Golden Globes for in 2020? Mostly just a few hours of celebrity gazing, at this point. A stretch of time that, yes, can occasionally swell to something grander, something dimly approaching important, but is otherwise only a starry and distant evening to enjoy—or not—in January, just as the page has turned on another year. Maybe that’s all the show can be right now, for better and worse. Or that’s just complacency talking and the real solution—to the Golden Globes, not the world’s troubles—is to do some kind of radical shakeup next year. To introduce some actually edgy host, to honor a bold and forward-thinking array of nominees, to conjure up a sense that all the glitz has a real cultural sum to it. I’ll toast to that possibility, even if it means I’m lame for caring.”Here’s a look back at some of the most notable outfits on the red carpet:Here’s that Michelle Williams speech that you’ll all be reading about tomorrow:While Netflix went into the night with the most nominations, on the small screen side it was HBO who came out on top with four wins and, importantly for the network long-term, none of them were for Game of Thrones.For the New York Times, James Poniewozik had the following to say about Gervais:“Gervais himself doesn’t care about the Globes so much that he was hosting them for the fifth time. He and everyone knew why he was there: to administer Hollywood a mostly consensual lashing, to be the Nihilist-in-Chief, the guy who doesn’t care what anyone thinks. He had a joke about Felicity Huffman’s jail sentence in a college-admissions scandal, and a heavily censored one imagining Judi Dench, of “Cats,” grooming herself in, er, a feline manner.It was sometimes uncomfortable, but not especially daring.”A cursory look of Film Twitter and some early reviews might suggest that Ricky Gervais was a flop host tonight but not if you look much further to the right.Controversial former NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch tweeted that he was “the ballsiest host ever”. Breitbart reporter Alana Mastrangelo tweeted that he’s “the only one who deserves an award tonight”. Ben Shapiro called it “the BEST THING EVER”. Candace Owens praised him as “a celebrity with the balls to clue Hollywood in on the painstakingly obvious truth that we DO NOT CARE WHAT THEY THINK”. So congrats to Ricky.Yeah about those Joaquin F-bombs that were removed from the almost live broadcast earlier. Here they are! “To my fellow nominees, we all know there’s no fucking competition between us” “There is no fucking best actor”“Contrary to popular belief, I don’t want to rock the boat. But the boat is fucking rocked” Full video on its wayAnd here’s how it all began with what’s allegedly, hopefully the last ever Ricky Gervais Globes opening monologue:This is an important and deeply embarrassing question:It’s been a night as long as an Irishman so in case you need to go back and check who won what then here’s a handy list:Another first of the night: Awkwafina has become the first Asian-American woman to win the Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy filmSad but true but also amazing"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9174abb5f9c7cca3f061404f4d4e6ca80873b0a2/0_1180_8031_4820/master/8031.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7824870616ea2b6a7158897441d2c2f3","title":"rachel roddy recipe fennel gratin","story":"A gratin to ‘win over fennel-hating hearts’A bulbous hand with green fingers is how I think of Florence fennel. Every now and then, my friend Carla Tomasi brings me some she has dug up that morning from her garden just outside Rome: perfectly white bulbs with uncut fingers up to half a metre long, and surrounded by enough feathery fronds to make a Vegas headdress. Back at the market, fennel fingers are pretty much always trimmed down to human size. At the supermarket, they are trimmed even harder – and the fronds, too – which is a shame, because they are like a herb accessory for a vegetable hand.Florence (or bulb) fennel was developed by Renaissance gardeners in the 17th century a domesticated cultivar of wild fennel that has been known to grow vigorously over the Mediterranean Basin, India and Pakistan for more than 2,000 years. While Florence fennel is a vegetable, its wild relative is a robust, perennial herb with hollow stalks, feathery yellow flowers and even more feathery leaves. It was in hollow stalks of wild fennel that Prometheus is said to have hidden the fire he stole from the gods, and by giving it to the human race, he raised them from their state of brutish ignorance.While both bitter and sweet wild fennel are herbs, they also produce seeds and have small, swollen roots, making them three times as valuable: a herb, a spice and a vegetable. It’s also a medicine: the Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder lists 22 remedies that include fennel, while in the 10th-century Anglo-Saxon Nine Herbs Charm, used for the treatment of poisoning and infection – fennel is crushed to dust alongside mugwort, cockspur grass, cress, plantain, mayweed, nettle, cress and thyme, also old soap and apple juice. In the middle ages, villainous Venetian wine hawkers apparently handed out bits of fennel to customers, along with nuts, knowing it improved the taste of bad wine, while doctors recommended it as a way to get rid of bloating and incessant farting, helping digestion and sweetening bad breath.My Sicilian mother-in-law still thinks of fennel as a breath sweetener and palate-cleanser. In season, it is always on her table, either cut into wedges and served in icy water, or as part of an orange and fennel salad. It’s the sweetness of Florence fennel that balances its subtle but unmistakably anise flavour, which is further helped by citrus, as the Arabs and Sicilians know well. Sicilians also know that fennel bulbs have a sex: the elongated ones being female, the rounder ones male – and sweeter, apparently. However, if you don’t like anise, no wisdom about sex or sweet orange is going to convince you otherwise. That said, dislike of fennel can come from the fact you have met rather too many tough and stringy ones. When choosing, look for roundness and freshness – green fronds, even just a few of them, are a good clue to this. Also how tight the overlapping layers are at the base of the fingers.Always trim fennel rigorously, chopping off the fingers, base and pulling away the thicker layers (which can be used for stock) a shock because the bulb reduces to nearly half the size. I like the Roman way of serving raw fennel dipped in olive oil and salt at the start of a meal, or the Piedmontese one of using its canoe-shaped curves to scoop from a warm bath of anchovy, garlic and butter.Then there is cooked fennel, where crisp is transformed to tender and velvety (my partner would say slimy, but he says the same about carrots), and the aniseed calms right down. I am a cooked fennel lover: braised with butter or tomato sauce and olives baked with fish as fritters with mayonnaise also fennel parmigiana and gratin. If you wish, you can do an Alex Jackson-style gratin variation and press some strips of radicchio, fennel fronds and sliced garlic into the cracks, then pour over 100ml thick cream – it has won over many fennel-hating hearts. 5 large bulbs fennelSaltJuice of half a lemonButterA head radicchio, cut into strips (optional)2 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced (optional)100ml thick cream (optional)100g parmesan, gratedTrim the fennel bulbs carefully, cutting the fingers off away from the base (making sure they stay intact) and pulling away the thicker outer layers: set the fronds aside.Bring a large pan of water to the boil, add salt, lemon juice and boil the bulbs whole for seven to 10 minutes, depending on their size. By the end of cooking, the outsides should be almost tender and the hearts a bit firm. Drain.Cut the fennel bulbs into quarters and arrange in a single layer in a well buttered ovenproof dish.If you like, press the radicchio and garlic into the cracks, then pour over the cream.

It had, bar outstanding goals by Anthony Knockaert and Harry Arter, been a turgid afternoon’s football and Smith did not hide the fact he was happy to be spared further distraction. Asked for his feelings about, as the questioner put it, “a great competition”, Smith replied “I think it was, I think it’s lost its sparkle” and went on to cite unfriendly kick-off times and the scheduling of previous finals on the same day as top-flight fixtures. It was a damning use of the past tense and the conundrum is clear: the more managers feel the Cup is not being respected from the top down, the less likely they are to bother with it the more managers select shadow teams that can barely produce a spectacle, the less likely the authorities are to put the competition back on a pedestal. How can a way out be found? Nick AmesBrendan Rodgers was quick to dismiss the notion that Leicester City have a free hit at the domestic cups because their Premier League rivals are scrambling for a top-four finish but acknowledged reaching the final of a competition would act as a reward for their rapid progress. After an FA Cup third-round victory over Wigan on Saturday, Leicester host Aston Villa in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final on Wednesday and Rodgers recognises the value of going the distance. Leicester won the league four years ago but have not reached a final since winning the League Cup in 2000. “We will fight to get to the final,” said Rodgers, who will welcome back Jamie Vardy following a calf complaint. “And that gives you the opportunity to have something tangible to show for your development over the course of the period.” Ben Fisher“It was a little bit awkward,” Tom Pope reflected. “John wouldn’t speak to me.” The post-match meeting of the two teams in the dressing room was affected by the Port Vale top scorer’s tweets about John Stones. Perhaps, however, Claudio Bravo should have been the one giving Pope the silent treatment. Pope converted Vale’s first, and indeed only, effort on target. It is a recurring theme in Bravo’s chastening City career, dating back to his dreadful debut year when Pep Guardiola used to complain his side kept conceding to the first shot without rationalising why. Recently, Liverpool, Atalanta and Dinamo Zagreb have scored with their first shots on target against Bravo, Everton and Southampton with their second. Those initial efforts have veered from the unstoppable to the rather stoppable. Whether luckless or useless, Bravo’s presence can seem to gift the opposition a goal head-start and make it feel that City are playing with 10 men. Richard JollyRochdale’s life-affirming comeback against Newcastle was a triumph for 40-year-old Aaron Wilbraham, 17-year-old Luke Matheson who created the latter’s equaliser, and Brian Barry-Murphy, whose decision to introduce them as substitutes proved inspired. The manager boldly removed a terrorised Tyler Magloire on 30 minutes for Matheson before Wilbraham entered ahead of the second half and the striker subsequently fired in Matheson’s 79th-minute cross to cancel out Miguel Almirón’s opener. Wilbraham is a 22-year, 10-club veteran who lost his mother to illness last month. Of the equaliser he said: “It meant a lot. My mum was my biggest fan. Obviously for the family and everyone at the moment it’s been a hard time. She drove me everywhere when I was younger in a little brown Fiesta, with about £2.50 petrol money in to make training. I never had my dad around when I was younger so she was the only one.” Jamie JacksonTranmere’s three-goal comeback against Watford definitely had something magic about it. A team that had looked down and out and out of their depth gathered themselves and gave their all to get a result. But on the other side, Watford collapsed, with too many youngsters and no sense of collective responsibility. Perhaps, then, what these teams brought to the Cup was as important as what the Cup brought to them. Tranmere’s Micky Mellon believed his team needed a performance to prove they were still on the up after promotion from League Two last year. For Nigel Pearson, however, there was a dispassionate analysis that said defeat was better than losing first-team players to injury. In a sense his point was proven as one rare regular, Nathaniel Chalobah, was forced off at half-time. But the jolt in Watford’s momentum, not to mention a replay in Birkenhead, may come back to bother him yet. Paul MacInnesOle Gunnar Solskjær revealed a different side of himself before and after his team’s trip to Molineux. On Friday, he reacted to Robin van Persie’s suggestion that he was too nice to manage Manchester United, wielding club legend status by reminding that he, scorer of that goal on that famous night in Barcelona and many others besides, and not the one-season wonder Dutchman, is a true keeper of the faith. It was a baring of teeth that his former colleagues, including an approving Roy Keane, say he has always been capable of. And following a positive post-match verdict on another insipid performance, in which his team hung on for a replay, Solskjær turned his attention back to Van Persie’s criticisms. “There are different ways to motivate and inspire players, and I do not always believe in scaring them to play better,” he said. “After all, we are in 2020.” John BrewinDerby County’s victory over Crystal Palace was ultimately another game in which the use of VAR became the main topic of discussion. Rightly so given the potentially pivotal use of the pitchside monitor by the referee, Michael Oliver, but that should not completely take away from an assured display by Phillip Cocu’s men against opponents who sit a ision above them. Wayne Rooney was key to that but there were also impressive showings from others in white and black, in particular Curtis Davies and Tom Huddlestone, and watching on there came the strong sense that Derby have too much experience as well as quality to be 17th in the Championship for much longer. Derby may not reach the play-offs – they are currently eight points off Swansea in sixth – but a serious push up the table should be well within their reach. Sachin NakraniChelsea’s reliance on Tammy Abraham was underlined again during their victory over Nottingham Forest. With Abraham given a welcome rest Michy Batshuayi was handed a rare start up front and Olivier Giroud was on the bench. Yet Batshuayi struggled to make an impact in general play and Giroud was an unused substitute once again. Lampard is not a fan of either forward and it would be a risk for him not to find cover for Abraham this month, especially as Giroud is desperate to leave. Aston Villa are the latest club to target the former Arsenal striker, with Internazionale, Lyon, Bordeaux and Crystal Palace also interested in striking a deal for the 33-year-old, whose lack of football this season has put his place in the France squad under threat before Euro 2020. Chelsea, who are interested in Red Bull Leipzig’s Timo Werner and Lyon’s Moussa Dembélé, need to find a solution quickly. Jacob SteinbergAs Everton made desperately heavy weather of a Merseyside derby that looked laid out for them to finally win at Anfield, Liverpool’s oldest outfield head was a key influence in their deep disappointment. Once James Milner had departed prematurely – and worryingly for Jürgen Klopp – Adam Lallana took Milner’s armband and a leadership role he has rarely fulfilled since he gave up the captaincy of Southampton to head north. He nursed his stripling colleagues and debutant Takumi Minamino along as Everton were dominated. Injuries and the claims of other midfielders better suited to Klopp’s style have restricted his impact but with injuries piling up, Lallana may yet play a role in Liverpool’s path to the Premier League title. This is his sixth season at Anfield, more than likely the last, but he reminded he is someone who can be counted upon. JBJosé Mourinho enjoys semantics but, in distinguishing between VAR and what he calls “VR”, Tottenham’s manager made a real, and important, distinction. After lamenting the absence of video technology at the Riverside as Middlesbrough earned a deserved replay (Mourinho believed Ashley Fletcher’s goal should have been disallowed for offside) – he explained that he applauded the idea of a VAR being used to support referees’ decisions. However the system he has seen in use in the Premier League this season is, in practice “VR” – or a dictatorial remote referee. “I like VAR but I don’t like VR and we have VR,” said Mourinho. There was still a time for a detour into semantics, namely when he suggested Tottenham’s squad was so thin and inflexible they were now condemned to “playing without a striker” in Harry Kane’s hamstrung absence. That may surprise both Lucas Moura and Son Heung-min.

Her arrival at Chelsea feels like a gamechanger: the Australian is in her prime and it is the first time a player at her level has come over from the American league. We have seen Carli Lloyd, who played for Manchester City at a later stage of her career, and a few less-celebrated names make the switch but this signing feels different. The Women’s Super League is competing with NWSL to be the best league in the world and people everywhere will have sat up and taken notice.So it was important Kerr got off to a good start and Chelsea will be very happy with her performance in the 3-1 win against Reading. She provided an assist and was fouled in the incident that saw Grace Moloney, the Reading keeper, sent off. It is clear Chelsea went all out to sign the player many people believe is the best in the world. They want to get back into the Champions League and ultimately win it this was a very promising first appearance and, if we assume Kerr can only get even better with more games, it sets up a fascinatingtitle race.Casey Stoney will be absolutely fuming with Manchester United after their home defeat to Bristol City, but it could be the kind of result that makes their season. United had been consistent, if not spectacular, in their first top-flight campaign they’d dominated the teams they should beat and hadn’t disgraced themselves against the big names. But this should have been a home banker and if there was any complacency then Saturday’s result will surely have smartened them up. They had numerous chances and should have taken at least one United expect a team of winners and that means being ruthless. If this setback hardens them up then it might yet define their campaign they are still a team I fancy to make a strong Cup run.While we expect more of United nowadays, that is not to dismiss Bristol City. This was their first win of the season and breathes real life into their relegation battle. They don’t have the same big-brother backing from a men’s Premier League team and the people who have built their club up deserve massive respect. Belief can start to fade a bit when the harsh reality of your situation sets in, so this was a monumental result.Arsenal cruised past Birmingham and never had to get into top gear. They remain the team to beat and it was encouraging to see how they mixed things up to good effect. Their first goal, from Kim Little, came from a wonderful ball from Vivianne Miedema but I liked the way their second came from a more direct approach. Leah Williamson got her head up from centre-back and played a great long pass from which Jordan Nobbs scored, and it does no harm to use the length of the pitch like that. It makes them unpredictable and even more dangerous, particularly when many opponents will focus particularly keenly on stopping Miedema.They could have scored more. We know they are capable of it, because they put 11 past Bristol City and it was as if they decided to go out that day to bolster their goal difference. Maybe they need a bit of a nudge to put in more clinical displays and top teams will punish you if you don’t convert enough opportunities, particularly in the Champions League. But overall, this was a case of Joe Montemurro’s side starting 2020 as they left off in 2019 – sometimes making the game look easy.Brighton edged past Liverpool in a real six-pointer and, given the scarcity of wins down at the bottom, it gives their hopes of avoiding relegation a massive boost. But Liverpool are not down and out yet. They are looking more offensive and inventive these days, having struggled to create chances early on in the season, and will be encouraged by the debut Rachel Furness made in midfield. Furness has joined from Reading and, if Liverpool are to stay up, it is a fair bet she will be key to their revival. She spent the first part of this season on loan at Spurs and I don’t think they would be where they are now – safely in mid-table – without her influence. She is a real lynchpin with great energy, set-pieces and an eye for goal. It was a tremendous coup to sign her and, despite their lowly position, Liverpool will feel energised going into a huge home game against Manchester United.Pauline Bremer scored two more goals for Manchester City in their 4-1 win at Spurs, making it seven in seven WSL games this season and 13 in 14 overall. Nobody expected too muchafter such a long time out injured, but she is proving the “like a new signing” cliché to be right. Her first goal came after a lovely touch away from a defender and she added another before half-time in a match where City were dominant from start to finish. With Ellen White – who also scored at Tottenham – back and in form too, City should be an attacking force to reckon with from hereon and I feel they needed that, because they have gone a little stagnant in some ways. Their potentially decisive home match against Arsenal is less than a month away and if they can keep up this form, with two refreshed and energised forwards, then it could be game on in the title race.Everton’s visit to West Ham was called off after a flu outbreak in the hosts’ squad, and that’s certainly not something I ever encountered in my career. It means Everton must wait a few more days to see Izzy Christiansenin action. Christiansen could be a huge acquisition for them: she was a top player at Manchester City and took a gamble going to Lyon, where she hasn’t had the playing time she wanted. I’m sure she could have stayed with the French club and earned more money sitting on the bench, but she wants to play football and get back into the England fold. She knows Everton well, having started out there, and it’s a move that shows their ambition. They have almost sleepwalked their way through the last three or four years but those days look as if they are over.

It needs to be: no team has survived on fewer than 12 points at halfway“Maybe I’m a masochist,” Abelardo Fernández had said and maybe that explains everything: it explains why they called and why he came it might even explain why this could just work. That, at least, is the hope and at least there is hope now. The noise had just about died down, supporters heading home happy, when Eyol’s new coach appeared, their third in half a season. It was almost midnight, cold outside, and his throat was raw but he was smiling. “You have a bad time of it, you suffer, but you enjoy it,” he admitted, “and I tell them to enjoy it too.” This time, they had. Eyol are still the worst team in Spain, and by some way, but it’s a new year, a new them.Before Saturday’s Catalan derby an I Will Survive remix boomed round Cornellà by the end, some had started to believe they actually might. As the whistle went on a 2-2 draw, another song went round: “Yes, we can!” they chanted. Unable to beat Barcelona in the league in the 2010s, Eyol had been unable to beat them at the start of 2020 too, but this wasn’t the same. Sometimes a draw feels like a victory. When they’re top and you’re bottom, when you’ve barely even drawn at home all season let alone actually won a game, you’ve blown a lead and you’re losing with two minutes left, is one of those times. When you’re desperate, searching for something, anything, to hold on to definitely is.One-nil up through a David López header out of nothing, two superb moments from Luis Suárez, who has scored or assisted each of Barcelona’s last 10 goals and added one more of each here, had left Eyol trailing again. “When that happens, you fear the team will collapse, but it wasn’t like that, quite the opposite,” Abelardo said. On the touchline, Matías Vargas and Wu Lei were warming up. Talking, too. “I’ll play you in,” Vargas said. Soon, both were on. And on 88 minutes, he did. The Chinese striker hit his shot low and hard across Neto by the far post to grab an equaliser. Running to the corner, teammates piled on. “We’ve lost two points,” Suárez said, standing pitchside at the end, as Eyol’s players embraced, still applauding the fans. They had gained one.“It’s only a point, but it’s a turning point,” Abelardo said.It has to be. Eyol ended last season qualifying for Europe for the first time in a decade but they ended 2019 facing relegation for the first time in quarter of a century. In the summer, they lost centre-back Mario Hermoso, centre-forward Borja Iglesias, and manager Rubi. They lost two more since: under David Gallego, they collected just five points from 24 under Pablo Machín, it was five from 30. Gallego stood accused of being too flexible – the players ran the place, did what they wanted – and Machín of being too rigid, wedded to wing-backs when he didn’t really have them or the authority to convince them. There were whistles from fans, chants for the board to resign, accusations that players were mercenaries – although that would at least mean they fought.“I understand them,” Machín said, which was another way of saying he agreed. Eyol’s manager complained that all he had were pipiolos, a weird word which sent everyone to Wikipedia: a 19th century Chilean liberal, young, naive, and unprepared. Defeated, too. He wanted “real blokes”, players who “feel their profession”, not pipiolos. Defeated at Leganés just before Christmas, what he got was the sack. Eyol were bottom, five points from safety. Their record at home read: played nine, won none, lost seven. No one had been in a worse situation than this.Well, almost no one.Abelardo had, and he quite fancied doing so again. “Maybe I’m a masochist, but I like the challenge,” he said at his presentation. The situation was very, very bad, he admitted, an inescapable reality. But, he insisted, if he didn’t think there was some way out, he wouldn’t have accepted – and that was at least partly borne out by the fact that he, like Gus Poyet, had just turned down the job at fellow-strugglers Leganés, which was instead taken by Javier Aguirre. He also thinks it was harder at Sporting Gijón, the club in “ruins” where he led a revolution, winning promotion and avoiding relegation, and at Alavés, where he performed a miracle.The day Abelardo took over at Alavés, he was their fourth manager of the season. At his presentation he insisted they would survive, but few truly believed him. After 13 games, they were six points from safety. Within two games, he had won as many times as the previous three managers put together. They eventually finished 18 points clear of relegation. He found enjoyment in suffering, release, and helped his players find it too. Now, at Eyol, he had been called to do the same again. “When you’ve only got 10 of 54 points, players lose confidence in their ability they stop daring to do things we have to change that,” he said. “Bit by bit, day by day, session by session, game by game.”He didn’t have long to prepare for the game against Barcelona, the team where he had played, but something shifted. The system for a start: 4-4-2, tighter, more physical short, simple messages. “He told us to be strong, compact, to press, don’t let them think, closed space,” Javi López said. “With Abelardo we’re happy,” Vargas added.He was happy too. “I missed this I feel lucky to be able to do what I love,” the manager said. “You have a bad time of it. Just look at me: my voice is rough. It’s not easy: it’s not like basketball where you have time-outs or five players near you. You shout, and they can’t hear you amid all the noise, with all the people there. But I enjoy it and I tell them to enjoy it too. I said to them before the game: I would have paid to pull on this shirt and listen to the fans, to play in an atmosphere and a game like this. You have to enjoy it or you go out there and can’t perform, you suffer a mental block. When you compete, you enjoy it more.” Moribund for months, on Saturday, they did, belief returning.“New year, new manager”, López said. It could yet be that gymmembership, long forgotten by the spring. The opening goal had comefrom virtually nothing, Suárez had two good chances for 3-1, and Eyolwere offered a way back in with a red card to Frenkie de Jong remainsdramatic. Bottom of the table, four points from safety and with Leganésfast improving. They have just 11 points at the halfway stage. Theyhave won just twice and probably need to win nine more times in 19.“For ever swimming against the tide,” ran the banner unfurled before thegame and this is more like a tsunami. No team has ever survived on fewerthan 12 points at halfway. Only four have ever ended the first half ofthe season without a home win and none of them came close to survival. Itis hard still, they know, almost impossible, and suffering lies ahead. Butthat’s Abelardo’s thing and on Saturday, Eyol felt a little closer.“We can’t allow ourselves to be where we are,” López said. “This is a new start, I am convinced, absolutely certain. We have to give the best of us, think only of football, be aware that we represent a historic club. All I can say to the fans is: sorry, thanks, and we’ll get out of this. People might say I’m mad, but we’re going to survive.”• “Courtois is the best in the world,” Zinedine Zidane said after he had saved Real Madrid three times against Getafe. “Oblak is the best goalkeeper in the world,” Diego Simeone said after he had saved Atlético with an astonishing save in the last minute against Levante.” Ernesto Valverde didn’t say anything this time, at least not on this debate: Ter Stegen wasn’t playing against Eyol.• “The worst La Liga … or the best” ran the headline in El Mundo. The season reaches the halfway stage, when everyone has played everyone once, and Barcelona are “winter champions” on the lowest points total any winter champion has had and having picked up only half of their points on the road. Madrid have not entirely convinced but are level with them. And the worst Atlético under Simeone are only five points behind. It’s more competitive, but the question they’re asking is: why?• Whoever invented that line about easy as taking sweets from a child has never been on a Kings parade in Spain. Yep, it was Reyes, the event so important Spain’s footballers took a two-hour break on Sunday and Marca just couldn’t help pouring on the puns. Oddly, no one made much of E Royal getting Betis’s equaliser against Alavés. Or Santi Clause, despite Santi Mina scoring against Osasuna and Mara declaring Santi Cazorla a “gift” after he got the winner as Villarreal added Real Sociedad to a run that has also seen them beat Sevilla and Getafe in the last three league games, suggesting that maybe Europe isn’t beyond them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ff2dbc1252262912bf7b815f4f5af0fe6adb09b/0_213_4024_2415/master/4024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06737b84aaf9aa06aea0b3cd89e26575","title":"poverty stricken hungarians are easy pickings for traffickers on facebook","story":"Promises of a better life in many social media posts are often a trap for marginalised communities such as the RomaIn the village of Bag, north-east of Budapest, the houses along the main street are smart and well-kept. Tucked behind, up a slight hill, where the buildings become bare brick and the tarmac road turns into a dust track, people sit on the ground in the afternoon sun, talking and playing cards.These are the Roma, or the Roma who remain in Hungary, where they live on society’s edge, clinging on in the outskirts of towns and villages, shunned and stigmatised as potential criminals.Many have left, seeking a better life elsewhere in Europe, often in the UK. Poor and marginalised, they are easy pickings for traffickers who post adverts on Facebook promising a bright future for those prepared to travel.Many have succumbed to the temptation. A lot of young people have gone to the UK to work, say the people playing cards. One man who gives his name as Kalman says his 27-year-old sister has gone to Britain, to marry a Turkish man she had never met.An older man says many of his relatives have gone too. For a better life, he says.A woman holding a baby comes to the gate of her house. Sabrina says her sister is living in the UK after answering an advert on Facebook for an arranged marriage to an Iraqi man who wanted EU paperwork. The sister thought she’d simply have a better life. Sabrina’s husband emerges and shouts to her to come away from the gate.London, Manchester, Sheffield, Bolton, Leeds, Bristol – these are some of the cities where people have heard they can make money. The line between economic migration and exploitation is ill-defined: some who travel are aware of the risks but prepared to take a chance, others think they are off to start a better life only to end up in modern slavery.“It usually starts with some kind of promise that it is going to a better life,” says Agnes De Coll, head of anti-trafficking for Hungarian Baptist Aid, an NGO working with the country’s police. Young women in particular are vulnerable to traffickers who befriend them with promises of romance. “Most of the times they are afraid of the cities, they don’t know the language, they live in the rented apartment where they are doing the sex work and they don’t know anything better.“It is so frightening for someone coming from a village. It is shocking. That’s why they stay, because they are so afraid. It makes them even more vulnerable, more attached to the pimp.”Baptist Aid can get about 40 or 50 a year into shelters and help maybe another 100 more, but thousands of Hungarians are in similar positions around Europe. Jobs are advertised on Facebook, she says. One girl answered an advert for a babysitter. At the interview she was taken in a car to Slovakia and kept for two weeks until other girls arrived and then they were taken to the UK.They were told they could choose to be a prostitute or the wife of someone from a developing country. That girl escaped, she says, but blackmail is a problem. “There is usually a money-lender in the villages where the Roma live on the edges of towns and villages and they are always blackmailing the families every day, asking for more and more.“Sometimes they make the family work without pay to work off their debt and after a while they figure that if there is a young daughter in the family they can get rid of the debt. They threaten them with all kinds of things.”Rachel Harper, helpline manager for the UK anti-trafficking charity Unseen, says it has picked up dozens of cases of exploitation. “Traffickers know where to find vulnerable iniduals and how to target them, including online,” she says. “Cases of modern slavery, across various types of exploitation, have been reported to the Modern Slavery Helpline where the potential exploiter initially contacted the potential victim, recruited them or exerted control via social media.”Ion answered an advert on Facebook promising work and housing, but he reached the UK to be told he owed his trafficker money. He was threatened with violence, the wages he earned from a factory job taken from him.Mihai thought the advert he saw on Facebook would lead to a proper factory job, but he ended up picking vegetables for less than minimum wage, threatened with violence, even murder, kept in cramped accommodation and allowed no freedom.Maria Szuda stands in the darkness outside her apartment in the town of Orosháza, 200km south-east of Budapest, drawing heavily on a cigarette, her face lit by the glow of her phone as she scrolls and then points at the screen – a Facebook page, post after post of adverts for work in or travel to the UK.Facebook was where her 32-year-old daughter Ivett was recruited. She has been in jail since January when a British jury convicted her and her husband Karl Ring, 34, of controlling the prostitution of women trafficked into the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation.“Ten floors of whores”, a tabloid headlined the case: a London apartment block in Chelsea where Hungarians were brought in to work as prostitutes.The court heard they used low-cost airline Wizz Air to fly the women in before forcing them into sex work. Szuda had worked as a prostitute herself, the judge said, before marrying Ring - a former client.Ivett Szuda may not have been an innocent abroad, despite her mother’s protestations to the contrary, but researchers investigating trafficking from Hungary to the UK say many are and that social media has a key role in recruitment. The UN and European commission both list the UK as a major destination for Hungarians trafficked into labour exploitation. Other countries, notably Germany, the Netherlands and France, have higher rates of sexual exploitation but the UK is becoming an increasingly important destination.The European commission’s Together Against Trafficking in Human Beings document describes Hungary as “primarily a source and transit country for women and girls subjected to trafficking for sexual exploitation and for men and women for trafficking for labour exploitation”. It is not an ethnic problem – there are both Roma and non-Roma – more one of poverty, poor education and high unemployment, says Hungarian trafficking expert Viktoria Sebhelyi.Curious about the role of social media in recruitment, Sebhelyi teamed up with child psychologist Dora Varga-Sabján to create a Facebook profile purporting to be that of a 16-year-old Hungarian girl. They suspected that the platform was being used by people involved in trafficking to groom vulnerable young women who did not have a strong family network.The character they created was described as living in care and new to Facebook. They had her join some popular groups and sat back to watch what happened next. Within two weeks the profile was contacted by 116 people – 108 men and eight women, aged from 19 to 65.People added her to other closed groups. She was put in secret makeup and haircare groups where recruitment was going on. The men tended to open with a compliment – “Hi, I like your eyes” – even though the researchers had only posted an avatar.“I just want to make new friends. Is it okay? I don’t want anything more. I just want to understand you.”The researchers replied politely, making clear that the “girl” was under the age of 18 and asking if that was OK. Of course, they told her. Don’t worry.Then they asked more questions, probing for weaknesses. “Do you have a good relationship with your parents? Do you have a lot of girlfriends? How close are you?”It didn’t take long – sometimes just a couple of chats – for the subject to turn to sex. Some men talked about sex after only two brief chats. There were naked pictures and questions about her own sex life. In the closed groups, there were leading questions.“How did you get that look, did your parents buy it? No? Oh, your parents are dead, oh that’s interesting.”It was clear, says Sebhelyi, that these were the same methods used in trafficking: the identification of a vulnerable target and then the grooming.Twitter’s own rules prohibit the promotion of adult sexual content globally, including pornography, escort services and prostitution, though the existence of the #escort hashtag seems to fly in the face of this policy. Facebook forbids the publication of content that attempts to coordinate or recruit for adult sexual activities.The challenge for anyone trying to prevent recruitment through Facebook or Twitter posts is the speed at which they appear and disappear and, as Sebhelyi notes, the ease with which victims can be drawn into private groups away from public scrutiny. The Facebook page Maria Szuda was looking for was one of the largest UK forums for Hungarians - Legnagyobb Info Oldal Nagy-Britanniában.An array of messages advertise jobs and services, including people arranging travel to the UK. Most will be honest: spotting rogue ads is virtually impossible. But there are other less innocent sites publicly visible. One of the largest advertisers of sexual services in Hungary - red-life.net - has a Facebook listing redirecting to its website, where sex work is advertised both in Hungary and abroad, including the UK. Red-life is also on Twitter.The Lyukó valley, on the edge of the north-eastern industrial city of Miskolc, is not a place where the government takes care of people, says Andrew Turro, a coordinator with the Roma self-government. The old mining area is filled with shacks, interspersed with a few more substantial houses. There are green hills and fruit and vegetable gardens, horses and carts, old cars and farming machinery.“People prefer to live in the UK. They have work and a decent living and it is better than Hungary because they are not targeted as much,” he says. One man says his daughters are working in the UK, but he doesn’t know what they are doing. They’re working as prostitutes, says Turro, as he tries to get the attention of a neighbour whose husband is away taking people to the UK, mostly women.“I’ve got a lot of friends working abroad,” a younger woman says. “During the past four years a lot of people have left here. There’s very little money that people can make here.” Many children grow up thinking they want to work abroad, but they don’t end up happy, she says. István and his daughters went to the UK with a middleman. He worked in construction, they danced in a club near Manchester and had sex with men in the rooms above. Their employers held their passports and stopped them leaving.Prostitution is regarded as a practical route out of poverty, even if it is exploitative, says Gabor Varady, leader of the Roma minority self-government in Miskolc. “There is a certain sorrow that for family or economic reasons these girls are forced to do this. No one would want to do this, it is a last straw, it is not a pensionable job.“But someone working as a prostitute in the UK will make as much in a month as I do in half a year. How do you tell them to stop?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc3d03308cb867694524c6b17b38061b9df4c8d6/0_44_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c17abb4649f95ae1f0a6abbc21c71f4a","title":"how weight loss surgery saved my life","story":"I have felt fat since I was eight years old. But a gastric sleeve procedure gave me the head start I needed and finally put health and happiness in sightI don’t remember a time when I didn’t feel fat. While I started piling on the pounds in my late teens, I was teased as young as eight for being chubby. The idea stuck. I remember overhearing my mum saying that she was worried I would get anorexia: I didn’t even know what that was. Suffice to say, I never did. I felt fat long before I truly had a fat body, but eventually the latter caught up with the former. I tried to diet on and off from my late teens to my late 30s, but nothing stuck. I was deeply, painfully unhappy.I didn’t have a boyfriend throughout my 20s. Then, aged 30, I met my now ex-husband online, but that relationship was not without its complexities and I continued to gain weight. We got married in 2008. When we split up in 2013, I lost control and lived on junk food for a summer. I have always been an emotional eater and it was a vicious cycle. I was unhappy because I was fat, I ate because I was unhappy, then I gained weight because I ate.Then I made a decision to save my own life. I went to my GP and, as always, they asked about my weight – at 162kg (25 and a half stone), I was morbidly obese. This time, the doctor suggested weight-loss surgery.At first, I balked. I had never been to hospital for anything more serious than a broken bone, never stayed overnight or had surgery. At my weight, there were serious risks of complications and a small but real possibility I could die on the table. I remember walking down the street to work and stopping in my tracks at the thought of that.But as I walked down the street I was in agony – a fact I never shared with anyone, although I suspect they knew. I couldn’t walk for more than a minute without being in extreme pain. My back would seize up and my shins would burn from the strain I was putting them under. I knew I had to do something.So, in December 2013, I went to hospital for gastric sleeve surgery. This is where a large part of your stomach is cut away so you can eat only small portions before you get full. The surgery took four hours. Afterwards, I had to be woken every few hours and made to walk up and down the corridor because of the risk of deep vein thrombosis. The discomfort was bad for a week and I had a month of recovery before I could return to work.People can be really weird about weight-loss surgery. Some think it is a “cheat”. Others think that I have wasted NHS money, despite the fact that I’ve probably saved them a fortune in treating the complications that might otherwise have arisen from my obesity. As a society, we make such moral judgments around weight gain and loss and the right and wrong ways of doing it. People treated me as a failure when I was fat despite my good job and life. People laud my weight loss when they see it, but there is sometimes a sense of disappointment in me when they realise it wasn’t done through what they determine as willpower.But it was. The surgery is only the start. I have met people for whom it didn’t work who cheated the surgery. Having the surgery doesn’t guarantee success – it gives you a head start. You still have to commit to your weight loss and work bloody hard at it.That head start was what I needed. A chance to see a difference quickly and to turn my downward spiral into a positive feedback loop. One month after the surgery, I was walking for 30 minutes or more without pain. I now walk everywhere I can, trying to get at least 10,000 steps a day.The stomach is a muscle, so after a while it stretches back to a normal size. I can now eat standard portions of food (although nothing like what I used to consume). I am not yet at my ideal weight and have joined Slimming World to get to my target, which is 16kg lighter than I am now.I used to be a size 30 now I am a size 14. I used to loathe shopping now I love it. The feeling of there being choices available to me that there never used to be is exhilarating. I used to avoid walking with others because the pain I was hiding made me quiet and unsocial now I regularly tramp around the marshes near my home for miles with family and friends. Whereas I used to go home alone, now my life is, at times, full of dating and fun.I have a confidence I never used to. I know things about me that were hidden under layers of fat and insecurity. I like my face now it has angles. I am even learning to like myself. It is hard and I don’t know if I will feel completely at ease with myself, even when I do achieve that final loss. But I no longer hate myself – and that is a powerful feeling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1678112bdcf900a67eec655e04c690907d5eeb4/0_45_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3ce3ed95df9aeba482e54910bc66a71","title":"support guardian readers 2020s hope","story":" Readers in 180 countries now fund our journalism, ensuring it remains rigorous, independent, open and accessible to all If a week is a long time in politics, then the past decade has been a lifetime in the media world – literally in some cases.The 2010s will be remembered for many things: protest, austerity, populism, mass migration, Brexit. But perhaps one of the most dangerous developments in this most difficult of decades has been the revolution in the way we produce, share and disseminate information.Our media – how it is produced, financed and distributed – has been turned upside down. And as we enter the 2020s, the implications of this are clear for all to see: competing versions of “the truth” liars and confabulators winning high office across the world polarisation and antagonism deep fakes, rumours, confusion the evaporation of trust.Ten years ago, the traditional media ecosystem was still just about intact. Several rapid technological developments atomised it. The proliferation of smartphones ate away at the print model we had always used, and many newspapers – local and national – were forced to shut up shop. People stopped paying for news. Meanwhile, the seemingly unstoppable rise of social media produced rival platforms that would quickly suck advertising billions away from news providers.The resultant financial penury meant many titles turned to billionaires, sheikhs or oligarchs for a lifeline.

Highbridge, in Somerset, was second (£11,595).Laura Howard, a consumer expert at Zoopla, said: “The past decade has seen significant property price growth in prime London commuter belt towns, but despite this, our analysis still picks out pockets across south-east England that represent affordable value for commuters.“Areas outside London and the south-east are generally more affordable, but commuters can still save money on their daily travel into the likes of Birmingham and Bristol by looking at towns they might not have yet considered, but still have good transport links.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/411e7da47bdbb38c9211551fdf5877d709632490/0_235_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1640102a8af21ef7c5e46b71d8873f34","title":"uk employers fewer entry level jobs 2020 survey","story":"Survey shows slowdown in graduate recruitment accounts for bulk of decline Young workers will be forced to compete for fewer positions this year, as data suggests that the entry-level jobs market is set to stagnate.However, even this figure could prove optimistic after its research found that student recruiters are failing to hit their targets, pointing to a potential stagnation across the jobs market.A slowdown in graduate recruitment accounts for the bulk of the decline, though the survey also pointed to a slowdown in hiring of school leavers and apprentices in the months ahead.The research paints a worrying picture for young adults hoping to secure white-collar jobs across the country and appears to be part of a trend.Many of the jobs created in the UK over the past decade are too senior for students fresh out of school or university or are low-skilled, requiring little to no training.Figures collected by the Institute of Employment Studies show that of the 3.4m jobs created over the last 10 years, just 400,000 were classified as skilled and semi-skilled. Around 2.5m were considered professional or senior jobs, and were mostly taken by older, more experienced workers, while about 500,000 were classified as low-skilled.“What we’re seeing now is particularly concerning as employers are normally over optimistic at this time of the year. As we move through the recruitment season they typically recruit less than they had anticipated.”Isherwood said: “Outside the public sector the market is not looking particularly healthy. Government needs to get the economy moving otherwise this year we’ll be in for a stagnant graduate labour market at best. If the government want to see further growth in the apprentice market, they need to address employer concerns about how the apprentice levy works.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abc328ba8d91f43e4addf405cf428a8c1bcfcae3/0_118_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c46385b7fa81d48b8dd89857f465c75","title":"national youth orchestra of great britain martin review barbican london","story":"Barbican, LondonThe versatile young musicians played – and even sang – with ferocity in a stirring concert built around the theme of protestPerhaps 2020 is going to be the year in which orchestral players reveal their yearnings to be singers. Just a month ago at the Barbican, the Budapest Festival Orchestra had turned itself into an a cappella choir to sing some choruses by Dvořák, and here it was the invariably awe-inspiring National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain, conducted by Jaime Martín, beginning their concert with Hanns Eisler’s demonstration song Auf den Strassen zu Singen (We are Singing in the Streets), their 160 voices unaccompanied apart from the intervention of a side drum to drive the song to its urgent, aspirational climax.It made the perfect start to a concert that had been built around the theme of protest. It ended with Shostakovich’s 11th Symphony, “The Year 1905”, reflecting the events of that year in St Petersburg, when demonstrators marched to the Winter Palace to petition the tsar and a bloody massacre followed. Most of the symphony’s themes are based on 19th-century revolutionary songs, and NYOGB morphed back into a choir again to sing three of them to preface the movements in which they are featured most prominently.But it was the technical brilliance and ferocity of the orchestral performance that impressed even more: not only in the rasping brass and howling woodwind, but in the intensity of the string playing, whether raw-edged in the fierce second-movement scherzo, The Ninth of January, or plangently elegiac in the dialogue that opens the third, Eternal Memory.The 11th is hardly the subtlest of Shostakovich’s symphonies, but it is one of the most graphic, and Martín’s high-pressure, high-speed performance didn’t spare any of its vividness.The centrepiece of the programme was Britten’s Sinfonia da Requiem, but here Martín’s hell-for-leather approach wasn’t quite so successful, the ensemble not as tight and faultless as it was in the Shostakovich, and with a lot more depth to be found in the outer movements than was suggested here. But it still fitted perfectly into what was an extraordinarily stirring, uplifting concert.• At the Royal Concert Hall, Nottingham, on 6 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/870aed62ee56002143197f7d16b5315334518bc7/0_0_2972_1981/master/2972.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ffd422dd07ad0b5fd30e31b57c125363 1760w","title":"our readers reveal how theyll have their last fling with the eu","story":"As our rights in Europe are set to be curtailed, Britons tell of plans on the continent from Interrail trips to learning GermanBritish citizens will no longer be EU citizens from 31 January if the withdrawal agreement Boris Johnson sealed in October is ratified.But Brexit day will not be the full stop on almost three decades in which British people, like their counterparts across the EU, had the freedom to travel, work and retire in any other member states visa-free.Those rights are scheduled to end on 31 December, when the transition period expires, freedom of movement ends and Britain leaves the single market.We asked readers what they would like to do in the last 11 months in which these benefits of EU membership apply.Plan: Take as many trees as I can to the DordogneAfter Brexit, I’ll almost certainly need a phytosanitary certificate for each species of tree. Completely unaffordable at my scale of operation. So I’ll take as many trees as I can, and from next year on I’ll have to change the way I work, to try to propagate my trees in France, which will be tricky, as I’m not there all the time.I might have to dig a large pond and grow my tree seedlings on rafts, hydroponically, so they’ll be protected from slugs, mice, deer, boar and rabbits. For some of the people I’ve got to know in the business, Brexit will be a disaster, as some of them sell the great majority of their plants to the EU.Unemployed and disabledPlan: Get an electric wheelchair in the EUI will continue my discrimination claim against the government body that I worked for, using the fair laws from the EU that cover workers’ rights before they are rewritten and possibly withdrawn by the Tories to exclude holiday pay or disability support.I’d love to visit some more EU countries, but as my NHS wheelchair provider has been privatised, I need to fund £6,000 for the electric wheelchair suggested by said provider before I can leave the house independently or at least with minimal support. Please note that research has shown there to be other options at much lower price points, but they have not been considered by the provider.I think I will also invest some of my time investigating the possibility of remaining an EU dual national by descent as my mum’s family are Irish immigrants, but it’s OK because she voted Tory as she says, “We have too many immigrants in this country.”I might also look for a new, less xenophobic family.I am living and still working with metastatic lung cancer. I cannot get affordable travel insurance. After we leave the UK I will be unable to visit Europe again, which is especially bad because I plan to retire next year.I am devastated that within a year’s time I’ll cease to be an EU citizen, but I intend to make the most of it. Once I graduate I plan to embark on a few weeks interrailing through most of northern and central Europe I’m going to visit cities across Germany, Austria, Hungary and Switzerland and develop my German language skills. Other than that, I’ll try to visit as many of my EU friends whom are dotted across Europe whilst it is still practical to do so.IT finance and riskPlan: Move to an EU state with accelerated route to citizenship for skilled workersI am going to move to one of the smaller EU27 countries that has an accelerated route to citizenship for highly qualified or skilled workers. Several of the eastern EU countries have this – Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia, for example.I have enough in the bank to afford to support myself in such a move, to set up a start-up or work for a firm over there.Whichever country I settle in, I intend to have a sideline recruiting highly skilled finance \u0026amp IT workers who are also looking for a quick route to EU citizenship. I expect this brain drain to really accelerate in 2020 during the transition period. The UK will become a goldmine for talent for smaller EU countries.Make sure I obtain Irish citizenship and then a passport ASAP.I had an Irish grandmother who left the Republic because she didn’t fancy a life of drudgery on the family farm. She watched part of the 1916 Rising across the street from the GPO (General Post Office, centre of the battle) and got shot at.Most importantly, I’m going to spend the year telling my European friends and colleagues that I love them and that Scotland needs them to stay.I’ve always wanted the UK to stay together but that is over so I’ll be campaigning for Indyref2 and a Yes vote. Finally, I’ll be making a special effort to be kind to folks. This is so important at this time. P.s. I’d also like to take a train journey on to the continent in late Mayearly June. No more flying.Writer and activist for Syria UKMy first trip to Europe was in 1963 – my brother and I went with our parents to Austria by train and it was the most exciting thing. I’ve never looked back and will continue to visit Europe as long as my health allows it.I love this country but now it feels mean and I feel like I’m wandering in a wasteland.My partner and I are going off in our camper van in January, we aren’t sure where we are going but we are getting out of here for a while, probably down to Spain and Portugal.Later in the year I hope to visit my cousin in Italy – she is English but has been married to an Italian doctor and has lived in Italy for 35 years and she is very sad to see us leaving and I am heart-broken too.Become a German. Odd? Not really – I have come to know Germans quite well and know that they are very open and generous people who can not understand why the Brits have gone off the rails so radically. None here understands why people in the UK are so radically opposed to working with the “Continent”.Lucy (name changed for confidentiality)Stay at home mum, 43Plan: Get IVF again in the EU at the same price.I’ve been offered a job in Germany working in customer service for Microsoft. I had never intended to take up an office job (all my previous jobs have been in tourism and involved being active). However, my priority is now leaving Britain for good.I have been making the most of freedom of movement since the age of 18: I have Interrailed and travelled extensively, studied at a French university, worked in France as a tour guide, worked as a holiday representative in Spain, worked in a hostel in Budapest.I’m using my last year of freedom of movement, as a British citizen at least, to become a legal resident of Germany and then hopefully one day regain the rights I am about to loose due to Brexit.Thanks to Brexit, I won’t be able to easily keep doing the seasonal work I love doing, because the likelihood of receiving a work permit as a non EU national is slim to none. I think it’s a great shame because I have lived, worked and studied in three other countries already at the age of 21, all without hassle due to freedom of movement. Boris’ intentions for Britain scare me and I feel no option but to leave the UK to secure a better future for myself.Plan: Get Irish citizenship (even though I have no Irish family connection)I shall be applying for Irish citizenship so I can retain all my rights as a European that have been taken away without so much as a please by the nut Brexiteers.Having lived here for nearly 20 years, it shouldn’t be a problem but, as someone with no familial Irish connection, it’s going to cost over €4,000 for the four of us in my family.However, it will be well worth it not to have to be part of the dysfunctional UK. Showing a blue British passport as you queue with all the other non-Europeans would be the last straw. I shall have a small passport burning ceremony if I’m successful.Plan: move to FranceWe will sell our house and try to persuade the French to let us live there.Plan: considering a move to FranceI am seriously considering moving to live in France together with my wife to join our daughter and eldest son (and seven of our 10 grandchildren) – both of whom moved to France some 20 years ago. However, we have a dilemma – our youngest son and his wife with their three young children live close by to us in North Wales and it would be a tremendously difficult decision to make.I have lived and worked in mainland Europe all of my working life – in Germany, France, Netherlands, Belgium and Italy. I was devastated and dismayed by the results of the general election and feel Brexit is the wrong thing to do – a big mistake – no one has ever given me any convincing argument or advantage for leaving the EU – no one ever will.Plan: Travel in EUPlan: tie the UK to EuropeBuy 100,000 kilometres of premium steel cable, 5m thick and tie Europe to our nation so as we never lose our close ties to Europe, as we are all Europeans.Acquire Dutch citizenship, at all costs. I have not lived in the UK since May 2003 and to have to return would be a personal tragedy. My life is here, I have no connection with the UK. I will never go to Britain of my own volition.Apart from this, we hope to start a collective of musicians and artists to challenge the destructive myths of our society. We live in a society whose dominant narratives, of human centrality on the Earth, social and technological progress, endless growth,the primacy of the inidual … these stories no longer have any basis in reality, and no longer equip us to deal with the political and ecological challenges of the new century.Thus, the next challenge, the most pertinent and urgent, must be to reinvent our cultural narratives to reflect our new situation. In the Netherlands we still have some hope that we can avoid our government being taken over by corporate-sponsored ethnic nationalists.To my fellow British-Europeans: I’m sorry for how things worked out for you. Don’t give up, but reevaluate, because a narrative which claims our current economic and political institutions can continue with minor progressive-oriented adjustments is no longer convincing, and will become less so as ecological and social disasters occur with ever greater frequency.Plan: get funding for an Erasmus period of study elsewhere in the EUI would like to pursue a postgraduate degree abroad, somewhere that is cheaper than in the UK. After three years of my undergraduate degree in Scotland, a place where an English-registered student still has to pay £9,000 a year, with classes bountiful with European students who pay less than I have for the same teaching and degree classification, I am looking for a bargain.Plan: move to another EU country, probably PortugalI’ve worked as an outdoor grower and harvest manager of an organic farm in Cornwall, I also team led Erasmus projects in Europe.I’m obviously very sad about the nation I can no longer be a part of I’m English in birth only.You may not be able to change the direction your country is moving in, but you can change your future.

The very man whose idea it was in the first place, I wouldn’t argue with him as Im not qualified to do. He’s the professor of economics and recognised for it not me. I have carried out more reading on this one subject over the past four years than on any one single subject and therefore feel I take a balanced view. This whole circus pantomime played out right in front of our eyes and showed failings on all sides but was so intense it opened people’s eyes and I wasn’t surprised at the result of OUR general election.Plan: might move to NetherlandsI can’t stand to see the NHS fall apart under another Tory government, the stress of the job is too much even as a student and seeing my nursing colleagues struggle day after day unsafe staffing levels is too much.With leaving to Europe I need to get my skates on as my nursing degree may not be recognised and I will have to apply as a third country which involves a more complex, lengthy and expensive application process. Fingers crossed I can pass the Dutch language test and get on their nursing register before the Dec 2020 deadline."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/872e03f001de5e1c9a25f71e2237124c6d4a6cf8/823_627_853_512/master/853.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cefaab2b863b848324cef4b4a8ecf9c9","title":"peaks parks and a beautiful beach city running in edinburgh","story":"From an extinct volcano to the 187 steps at Castle Wynd, there are plenty of highs for runners in Edinburgh – but if you want something less strenuous but equally stunning, try the beautiful beaches and picturesque parksEdinburgh oozes beauty from every pore and its dazzling architecture, stunning landmarks and lush green spaces make it a superb city to run around. I’m lucky enough to call Edinburgh home and the splendour of the city never ceases to amaze me.As daylight hours shorten, many runners would happily hang up their trainers for the winter but the rush of endorphins I get while running is the best thing to stave off seasonal sadness. When anxiety hits, I find the rhythmic pounding of my feet on the pavement and focusing on my breath calms my mind. The city is full of terrific running spots – from punishing peaks, to parks, to the gentle beauty of the beach. The only real difficulty you’ll have is deciding which one to tackle first.City centre sightseeingRunning is a brilliant way to see Edinburgh’s main historical landmarks and a jog through the city centre’s hilly streets really works up a sweat. For a pavement-heavy run, start at Waverley station and run west along the city’s main shopping thoroughfare past the famous Scott Monument, through the picturesque Princes Street Gardens, crunching through fallen leaves as you head towards Lothian Road. Swing left on to Kings Stables Road, then feel the gradient increase sharply at Johnston Terrace, marvelling as Edinburgh Castle looms above you.The brave can scale the 187 steps at Castle Wynd in a sprint to the castle esplanade, home to the annual military tattoo. After the uphill effort, I like to take a moment to catch my breath as I soak up the view of my beautiful birthplace, before running from the castle down the Royal Mile to the Palace of Holyroodhouse passing St Giles’ Cathedral this is a welcome downhill jog after the castle ascent.Holyrood Park and Arthur’s SeatAdjacent to the Palace of Holyroodhouse and the Scottish Parliament building is one of Edinburgh’s most famous landmarks – Arthur’s Seat. The extinct volcano dominates Edinburgh’s skyline and if you scale the peak, which sits 251m above sea level, you’ll be rewarded with panoramic views of the city and neighbouring Fife. Arthur’s Seat sits at the centre of Holyrood Park and the whole area holds a special place in my heart – it was the scene of my first ever 5K race and where I really caught the running bug.Portobello beachJust 3 miles (5km) from the city centre lies Portobello, a popular seaside destination for Edinburgh residents since the 19th century. I’ve been coming here since I was a child and find there’s nothing quite like the invigorating power of sea air to boost your mood and a beach run is the perfect antidote to the bustle of the city centre. A popular destination with runners, particularly following its inclusion in the Edinburgh Marathon route, the section of the promenade towards Musselburgh gives you the stunning view of the Firth of Forth on one side and elegant Georgian and Victorian architecture on the other. I usually choose to sprint along the smooth Victorian boardwalk but in colder weather find myself drawn to runs along the beach which glistens with frost in the winter, enjoying the sensation of sand moving underfoot. Once I work up an appetite, I visit one of the great selection of independent bars and cafes on the promenade for post-run refuelling.Water of Leith walkwayA combination of paved path and gravel track, this 12-mile (19km) walkway snakes through the city from the foot of the Pentland Hills to the port of Leith and is great for runners who enjoy off-road, traffic-free running, as I do. The route takes you through some of Edinburgh’s most attractive neighbourhoods and my favourite stretch of the path runs from the Shore in Leith to the Gallery of Modern Art via the Royal Botanic Gardens, swanky Stockbridge and the delightful Dean village. The area around the Dean village is particularly charming and features a fast-flowing, roaring current, tree-lined paths and bridges across the water.The running trail can sometimes get a bit muddy, so an all-terrain shoe is very much needed, and the waterway is home to lush vegetation, an abundance of wildlife and six life-size humanoid sculptures by award-winning artist Antony Gormley. As well as being a popular path for runners, you’ll also find the route frequented by friendly dog walkers, cyclists and even the occasional horse rider.Inverleith ParkJust to the north of the New Town and Stockbridge, you’ll find Inverleith Park – a sanctuary of green space in the heart of the capital and one of Scotland’s largest urban parks at 22 hectares (54 acres). Inverleith boasts a wonderful view of Edinburgh Castle and is a favourite spot for locals to assemble to watch the various firework displays that take place towards the end of the year.I love Inverleith because it’s a park that’s got something for everyone, including sports pitches, allotments, a pond and a children’s play area. The tree-lined park splits into four near equal parts by a combination of concrete path and muddy trail – and my favourite running routes takes the form of a figure of eight circuit of the grounds. I always make a point of visiting the recently installed wet garden, which includes a range of plant species that will help reduce blue-green algae in the water. A wooden boardwalk provides access to the area to view the flora and fauna that now inhabit the pond."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0487dad9315f52306b77b49ddab55b17e14e1aae/0_142_3058_1835/master/3058.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df400887bcda8299f051a8908b4c6908","title":"rugby union talking points weekend premiership","story":"Willi Heinz is showing that Eddie Jones made the right call at the World Cup while there are encouraging signs at Welford RoadWilli Heinz was one of the more left-field selections in last year’s World Cup, called up by England at the age of 32 as one of two scrum-halves in their squad. The promotion of the New Zealander, who qualified through a grandmother, annoyed Danny Care, who for three years had appeared to be bound for Japan. Judging by the performances of the pair over the weekend, Eddie Jones not only made the right call but may be reluctant to jettison Heinz, who is now 33. The biggest single reason Gloucester came from behind to defeat Bath was Heinz’s ability to react to what he saw rather than read from a script. Gloucester are a curious mix of a side: on the one hand they make basic mistakes and creak in the set pieces but on the other they have the ability to make much from little, the likes of Heinz, Danny Cipriani and Mark Atkinson loading the gun for Ollie Thorley, Louis-Rees Zammit, Jason Woodward and Jake Polledri to fire. They are the Premiership’s wild cards. Paul ReesSuddenly Welford Road feels a more uplifting place. This was a second consecutive match at the grand old fortress of English rugby that might be accounted “good”. Better still, unlike the preceding example (a home defeat by Exeter), Leicester won it. It seems ridiculous, given their personnel, to note how well Leicester can play when the mood takes them. Whatever else happens, this will not be their last win of the season, even if the Six Nations looms into view to disrupt them, just as they find some form. Bristol, meanwhile, drop out of the top four to join a band of seven clubs frantically scrambling for the higher ground as the black tide rises angrily beneath them. None of them is safe – not even Leicester. Michael AylwinThe former Munster and Ireland coach Declan Kidney does not even want to hear the word relegation mentioned with his promoted side sitting third bottom of the Premiership table having picked up a solitary point in their three league games either side of Christmas. He favours a glass-half-full approach, suggesting attack remains the Exiles’ best form of defence as they seek to work their way up the table. Given they scored four tries against the league leaders he may have a point. If Irish can also get all their best players fit for the run-in, they will remain hopeful of recovering from their midwinter slump. “It’s the first half of games that we’re doing damage to ourselves,” suggested Kidney. That’s where we need to make ourselves better.” For the moment, though, Kidney must soldier on without his Irish internationals Paddy Jackson and Sean O’Brien, neither of whom is set to be available for several more weeks, and hope that the Wallaby lock Adam Coleman’s shoulder problem is not overly serious. Robert KitsonPaul Gustard’s arrival at Harlequins last season was meant to sort out their defence but the six-try thrashing at Sale took them to 12 conceded in the last three matches with strugglers Wasps and Leicester the first two opponents. Quins were narrow in Salford and bypassed all too often. The experience of Mike Brown is being missed at full-back and Sale have one of the strongest squads in the Premiership. Quins have a core of hardened international experience yet they have conceded at least 30 points in five league and Champions Cup matches this season. “We were not good enough and got beaten up,” said their director of rugby, Gustard, who took aim at his England prop Joe Marler for a loss of discipline at the start of the second half that cost him 10 minutes in the sin-bin. “It was ridiculous,” said Gustard about the prop putting his forearm in the face of an opponent. “There was no need for it.” It is not just Marler who needs to get a grip. PRThere was a lot to talk about for such a one-sided and eminently predictable match. First of all Michael Fatialofa. Rugby is familiar with the long pause in play while a stricken player is tended to, so we know the precautions need not mean serious injury. Alan Solomons’ openness afterwards, however, about how concerned he is gives us pause, as does the news that Fatialofa has been retained in hospital with his neck injury. Fingers remain crossed. Otherwise Saracens were content, in their bubble against an angry world, to celebrate the retirement of Nigel Wray in style. Ten tries – and it could have been more – is a statement in this league, whoever cops it. We now have the sight of a team with a points difference of plus 121 propping up the league. MAEvery point may well prove crucial in the bottom half of this season’s Premiership and Wasps will be gutted not to have clung on to victory against 13-man Northampton having taken the lead with 10 minutes remaining of a dramatic high-scoring game. Then again, they won right at the end in Bristol a week earlier and will also know that home improvement will be fundamental if they want to avoid being sucked down into the relegation morass in the coming months. Their next three away league games, against Worcester, Leicester and London Irish, will be equally telling: there are signs of improvement visible but two wins out of eight is clearly less than ideal. Saints, on the other hand, have won six out of eight and have scored more tries and points than any other side in the Premiership. They may have been found out by Leinster in Europe but team spirit is healthy and winning is becoming a habit. “We made it hard for ourselves but I’m massively proud of the boys,” said man of the match Teimana Harrison.

Do we want thrilling battles or processions?If you enjoy a thing, it’s only natural to want more of it, as those of us who have done extremely well at the trough in the past fortnight are keenly aware. How, then, do we explain the recent Twitter polls which have come out resoundingly against the idea of adding a fifth day to the Cheltenham Festival?This, in my view, goes a long way beyond mere resistance to change. People are concerned, rightly, about dilution of competition and its potential to kill off the Festival’s appeal.One of flat racing’s biggest problems is over-provision of top-class races, enabling the best horses to avoid each other for much of the summer. It’s not such a hot topic in jump racing because almost everyone wants to win at the Festival, so the best horses tend to turn up there if they’re fit and we find out who’s best.But, as extra races are added to the Festival, it becomes less The Place Where Champions Clash and more The Place Where Champions Duff Up Inferior Rivals At Short Odds. Contrary to what some may believe, 70,000 people will not pay top dollar for the pleasure of being close to really talented horses. What they want is to see them race against each other instead, we are in danger of creating a race for each high-quality animal, so they can all start at 1-5 and win easily.Those short-priced favourites are shorter than they used to be, too. In 2004, nothing went off shorter than 8-11. In the last three years, we’ve had favourites at 4-11, 4-6, 1-2, 4-7, 1-4 and 2-9. No, they didn’t all win but anticipation is a huge part of the Festival’s appeal and, in anticipation, those races were widely seen as foregone conclusions.If we add the necessary races to give the Festival a fifth day, I worry that we’ll end up with odds-on favourites in every fifth race. Unless we somehow increase the available pool of equine talent, the best horses will simply be more spaced out than ever before.Trainers and owners are bound to love the idea of more Festival races, because it increases their chance of enjoying that moment in the winner’s enclosure that everyone covets. But those who love the sport must tell them, politely but firmly, that it is a terrible idea.The Festival is a massively successful event which puts racing at the centre of the sporting world every March. But there is no law that it has to remain that way.Fortunately, there are lots of intelligent, sensible people running the racecourse and in senior positions at the Jockey Club. I have every hope that, despite the financial temptations, they will see a fifth day for the elephant trap it really is.Thomas saddles Mick Manhattan (4.00) in the closing handicap hurdle at Chepstow and I like his chance at 5-1, from the opening 8s. He showed promise on his handicap debut here in November, staying on into third, and was predictably outpaced on good ground next time. He will not meet good ground here.Exelerator Express (1.50) appeals for his hurdles debut at 6-1 in what looks a weak maiden contest. Second in two bumpers, Neil Mulholland’s charge is bred to make a hurdler. The favourite, Beaufort West, needs a wind operation to have made a significant difference.There might be a few spills in the 16-runner novice handicap chase and the market seems to be underestimating Tanrudy (2.25) at 9-1, given he is one of just two in the field to have won over fences. He’ll be on the front end from the off, meaning he will miss any trouble that happens in behind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5209b783db6006d5c6e2e5784b188a281fc1c050/0_393_2813_1687/master/2813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19bedf7a3acfa106086319b2b4e4e53a","title":"south africa v england second test day four live","story":"Tea South Africa have a chance of saving this match. England are still strong favourites, with four sessions remaining, but the pitch isn’t doing a lot and South Africa know their way round a fourth-innings rearguard. See you in 15 minutes for the final session.22nd over: South Africa 46-0 (Malan 23, Elgar 21) Joe Root brings himself on for the latest before tea. A lot goes on but nothing happens, and South Africa go to tea unscathed. Pieter Malan and Dean Elgar have played impressively.21st over: South Africa 44-0 (Malan 22, Elgar 20) Denly enquires politely for LBW when Malan pushes forward with bat and pad together. Even if it was pad first, he was outside off stump. Another encouraging over from Denly, who will hopefully continue after tea.“The StokesFlintoff debate is getting a tad tedious,” says Nacmac Bok. “The definitive answer to an allrounder debate is always Jacques Kallis.”Even when the question is about English allrounders?20th over: South Africa 43-0 (Malan 21, Elgar 20) Curran continues around the wicket to Malan. He leaves everything outside off stump, including a couple of deliveries that lift from a length. His judgement looks excellent.19th over: South Africa 41-0 (Malan 20, Elgar 20) Another imaginative bit of captaincy from Joe Root, who has brought on Joe Denly to replace Dom Bess. There’s a lot of rough outside the left-hander’s off stump, and we saw how dangerous the part-time legspin of Marcus Labuschagne could be during the Ashes.Malan overbalances and is fortunate that the ball hits the pad and deflects wide of Buttler for a leg bye. Had it done so, that would have been a stumping chance. The next ball bursts from the rough to Elgar, who gloves it in the air on the off side. The delivery after that rips through the gate to hit Elgar in the chest, and he ends the over by missing a slightly flustered sweep stroke. A superb, mood-changing first over from Denly.18th over: South Africa 39-0 (Malan 20, Elgar 19) Sam Curran comes on to replace Jimmy Anderson. I think he’ll be an important bowler today, with his variety, intelligence and golden arm. He goes straight around the wicket to the right-handed Malan, who offers no stroke to a ball that curves reasonably close to off stump. Another maiden, the fourth in five overs.“Interesting debate about the best all-rounder,” says Max in Germany, “but I think Stokes has the talent (and time) to be even more devastating than Kallis.”What Stokes doesn’t have, and probably never will, are Kallis’s ruthlessness and concentration. That’s why his career averages will be nowhere near as good. But you can’t really judge Stokes by statistics. It’s like trying to quantify love, or something.17th over: South Africa 39-0 (Malan 20, Elgar 19) Apologies, I’m all over the show here. To be honest, very little is happening. South Africa are plodding along comfortably, England are getting no help from the pitch or the Kookaburra ball. 16th over: South Africa 37-0 (Malan 20, Elgar 17) Malan does well to shoulder arms and allow a lifter from Anderson to whistle past his armpit. He looks an accomplished old-fashioned opener, an observation supported by his first-class record: 10,000 runs at an average of 45.“Re: Faf’s debut rearguard hundred... look at AB’s scoring rate in the second innings!” says Kevin Wilson. “For a guy with a reputation as a 360 degree player made for T20, he could bat out time when his side was under the cosh phenomenally well. Check this out against India in 2015. South Africa lost, but they batted 143 overs for 143 all out! De Villiers scored 43 from 297 balls!” That team was great at putting the shutters up. The thing I love most about de Villiers’ rearguard in Adelaide is that, six days later, he lashed 169 from 184 balls to win the series. Where do you even start with that level of brilliance? Headingley 2019, I suppose.15th over: South Africa 37-0 (Malan 20, Elgar 17) Another economical over from Bess. He’s not really threatening, though, and I’d like to see Sam Curran have a few overs from that end. 14th over: South Africa 37-0 (Malan 20, Elgar 17) Sorry, I keep missing the actual cricket to attend to emails. The lack of excitement in the TV commentary suggests you’re not missing much.“I’d agree re Freddie being a better bowler,” says Boris Starling. “You rarely get the sense that Stokes is capable of turning a game with the ball the way he is with the bat, or that he could bowl an over like Flintoff’s famous one at Edgbaston to get rid of Langer and Ponting in 2005. When it comes to discussing all-round play, we shouldn’t forget Stokes’ fielding, which is as good as anyone in the world right now and as any England player in history. If it came to picking one man to take a catch for my life, I’d probably still have Mark Waugh, but Stokes would definitely be in the mix.”Flintoff was an immense bowler. At his best, he was the most irresistible England bowler of my cricket-watching lifetime. Others did it for much longer, I realise.13th over: South Africa 37-0 (Malan 19, Elgar 17) Bess has a slip and short leg for Malan, who looks comfortable in coming down the track to the offspinner. Three from the over. No sign of any bite for Bess at the moment.“Based on this morning’s evidence, we might be forgiven for thinking that Stokes cares more about England winning this match than nurturing his career average,” says Brian Withington. “The man clearly has no future in the game - let’s make him captain soon.”He’d be a shoo-in for an all-time Selfless XI. One of the best things about this morning’s innings is that Stokes took two - one for the team one for Dom Sibley. In a parallel universe Stokes batted at a normal tempo, Sibley worried that he was holding the team back and got himself out for 93.12th over: South Africa 34-0 (Malan 17, Elgar 17) Anderson changes ends to replace Broad (5-1-13-0), and Malan drives him crisply through extra cover for three. He’s playing nicely. As is Elgar, who pings a boundary through mid-on off the next delivery. This is a test of England’s patience.“I’d be quite up for a rearguard action here,” says Pete Salmon. “Remember those? Mark Greatbatch or Andy Flower batting for seven sessions, jumpers for goalposts. Nowadays it’s all Ben Stokes and Kusal Perera sort of nonsense. Be nice to be applauding Elgar off at the end of the match on 158 not out in a total of 8360. Proper cricket.”If anyone can, South Africa can. Faf du Plessis famously did it on debut, and that great side of the early 2010s had a few such rearguards. That said, those who really know their Onions would rather South Africa ended nine rather than eight wickets down.11th over: South Africa 27-0 (Malan 14, Elgar 13) Malan uses his feet to drive Bess for a single, something South Africa didn’t really do in the first innings. That’s drinks, which comes at a decent time for England’s thinktank.“Not sure why commentators are in a funk about letting Broad have a few overs out in the middle,” says Tom Atkins. “There’s plenty of time, he could use the practice out in the middle and for me the psychological value of making bowlers toil pointlessly and the openers sweat out on the field shouldn’t be underestimated.”Most people are disproportionately angry about something these days. And if you don’t agree, I’ll fill you in.10th over: South Africa 26-0 (Malan 13, Elgar 13) There isn’t a huge amount happening for Broad. This could be a case for9th over: South Africa 23-0 (Malan 11, Elgar 12) Joe Root decides to play a bit of slap-bass, bringing Dom Bess on first change. Nothing to report in his first over, but a nice, attacking move from England.“Stokes versus Flintoff - hard to judge as Stokes still has a long way to go,” says David Murray. “But for me he’s far more talented. Flintoff isn’t even in the top 10 best bowlers for England, whereas if it wasn’t for his suspension I think we’d be already talking about Stokes as one of our best-ever batsmen. And he could almost be in the team as a specialist fielder. Flintoff also had the advantage of playing in a good team.”I think it’s closer than that, and I wouldn’t put Stokes in England’s top 50 batsmen. I also think Flintoff has become a little underrated since he retired. But I’d definitely put Stokes above him, mainly because he wins at Top Trumps in the Miracles category.8th over: South Africa 21-0 (Malan 10, Elgar 11) Elgar hooks Broad for a single. He had plenty of time to play that stroke, another indication that the pitch has lost some of its zing. The moment I type that, Malan does well to get on top of a much nastier lifter. That might have hit a crack.7th over: South Africa 20-0 (Malan 10, Elgar 10) Thanks Tanya, morning everyone. It looks like England are going to have to work pretty hard for these 10 wickets. At least they didn’t use up their second review on that appeal in Anderson’s previous over. Umpire Smyth, officiating from his office, thought it was out when he saw it live. And that’s it from me as I trot off to buy emergency school shoes and handover to Rob Smyth to take you through to stumps. Thanks for all the emails and tweets, sorry I wasn’t able to publish them all, an avalanche in my inbox this morning! What a bloody great day’s cricket.6th over: South Africa 18-0 (Malan 9, Elgar 9) A maiden for Broad, as the fielders shoo away the lurking Hadeda.In his office, John Robbins has a keen eye for literals. Following the OBO at work on a slow day at the office. So slow in fact that David Stocker’s Bulgarian winter reminded me of the winter I spent in Romania, in Galati. So cold, the Danube froze over and I could have taken a stroll across to the Ukraine.Everything worked – busses, trams, my Dacia Logan, and the heating in my flat was so good (powered by surplus energy from the local steel mill) I had to open the window… No no-balls, but a couple of superfluous apostrophes in David’s post. (I told you it was a slow day in the office).5th over: South Africa 18-0 (Malan 9, Elgar 9) Anderson carrying more of a threat at the moment. He seems to have Malan caught by a ing Buttler as the slips rise up. Behind the stumps, much discussion as to whether to appeal but Anderson is already walking back shaking his head. With a quick glance towards the back of his retreating fast bowler, Root decides not to press ahead with a review. Wise decision - the noise was pad on pad. More judicious leaving from Malan.4th over: South Africa 17-0 (Malan 9, Elgar 8) Elgar and Malan play out Broad’s over without much to get excited about.AH! A reference to this I assume?3rd over: South Africa 14-0 (Malan 9, Elgar 5) Ah, just been reminded that Malan is making his Test debut, which makes that leaving in the first over all the more impressivefoolhardy. He shoulders arms again to Anderson here, in between knocking a couple of twos. 2nd over: South Africa 10-0 (Malan 5, Elgar 5) Elgar gets in on the act, through the covers for a nice cuppa tea and four malted milks. Broad’s line improves and fourth ball he appears to thump Malan on the back pad. Broad’s arms pump up and down like a demented marionette and, with seconds to spare, Root reviews. The replay shows the ball squeezing between front pad and bat, just trimming the edge of bat before hitting Elgar high on the back pad. Genrous Joel Eley’s cup floweth over : Following from Kuala Lumpur, it seems that a recipe for success as an England all-rounder is not to be a perfect role model. All have had front page headlines. However all have provided life long memories, Botham 1981, Flintoff 2005, Stokes 2019. Plus many others. Comparing stats does not do any of them justice as they go from sublime to ridiculous. However most of the the posts have not also considered how good they all were  are (in Stokes case) in the field. Beefy standing in front of keeper at 2nd Slip, Freddie run outs and Stokes only 5 catches in the last innings!! My moment of the World Cup was Nasser commentating after the catch “No way, you cannot do that Ben Stokes”. Appreciate them all is what I say.1st over: South Africa 4-0 (Malan 4, Elgar 0) Malan flicks Anderson’s first rather ragged ball for four, then lets the third ball alone and the ball skims the side of off stump. Oooh and again, and again, four balls in a row. Either he knows this pitch very well or he’s about to come to a rather embarrassing end.While Mark Slater wonders why Joe Root exposed Broad to a potential broken finger, Romeo is feeling for Dom Sibley: Sibley needed to reach 135 (and not get out) to end the match with a Test batting average of 40.135 was also the score Little Marnus (Marnŵs bach to his real friends)needed to score in the first innings at Sydney to end the innings withan average of 60.Marnus managed it of course, but Root chopped Sibley off.Such riches from you lot as well. Derek Stocker in frosty eastern Europe:Hello Tanya from wintery Bulgaria. The snow is coming thick and fast.As a Zimbabwean I find winter in BG a tad challenging. Still my firstwinter here, staying in a caravan renovating our derelict cottage wasalmost the death of me. I sprung from my 7 sleeping bags woken fromtwo enormous explosions. Lucky I wasn’t dreaming of the Rhodesian bushwar.Oh no! Chunks of orange ice all over the place. I don’t know whattemperature soda freezes at. The gas heater chugging out about 2calories of heat and the interior like an industrial freezer. Twobottles of orange pop kerbam, kerbam.When I went out next morning the thermometer deserved a secondglance...minus 37 centigrade. Almost Siberianesque. Still I survivedwithout losing any digits and in 9 years I have not experienced coldlike that again. Minus 20c has been the lowest.Anyway ma’am to the sport of the Goddess...Extra’s in this England innings.22 extra’s not a single no ball. That is crazy. 660 balls not asingle no ball. Impossible.And Daniel Shepherd in hotter Dubai “also a good time zone for OBOing”A suitably fine discussion for a day like this when we can enjoy the greater moments of English cricket rather than wallow in the gloom.For me there are two things that haven’t really been touched on. As two sublimely and naturally gifted players, the teams they played in is relevant. Stokes has become a wonderful batsmen in a team bereft of wonderful batsmen, whereas Flintoff led the bowling in a team full of decent batters. Would they have stepped up in the other discipline if they’d swapped teams?And the acid test is which one would you pick? Obviously the team makeup, as mentioned, would affect it but, for me, Stokes gets the nod for his astonishing fielding.111th over: England 391-8 (Sibley 133, Broad 8) And that is that. England declare with abounding riches, South Africa need 438 to win or have a day and three quarters to bat out. England, inspired by guts and glory from Sibley and Stokes, and with the fast bowlers well-rested, and the odd glitch in the pitch, should have this in the bag by elevenses tomorrow.110th over: England 382-8 (Sibley 127, Broad 5) Slightly funny period of play this, just one off the over and Rabada slams a ball into Broad which he inexpertly defends off the splice.A couple of newbies - thanks so much for tuningloggingclicking in.Steve Crick: Welcome to my first ever em such as this and I cannot pretend to cricket geekdom, but this live coverage makes me glad it’s not on the telly, not R5 for that matter. Keep up the good work! Am I allowed a mention of The Bradford Bulls?But of course. And Kevin Tong: I just have a quick questionclarification, what do you mean by “South Africa will now have to make the highest score in Test history to win the game”? A quick google tells me there have been higher scores in test history. Sorry, I’m a pretty new and naive follower of the game, haha.Sorry, I meant the highest score batting last to win the game. 109th over: England 381-8 (Sibley 126, Broad 5) Broad sweeps Maharaj fine and gallops off for a single, but it whizzes for four. He, with waterlogged boots, plays and misses his way through the rest of the over. 108th over: England 377-8 (Sibley 126, Broad 1) Broad deals perfectly calmly with a short one from Rabada, knocking it into the covers for a single.I’m trying to find out when England last managed 150+ runs in a session. They managed it twice last time they were in Cape Town back in 2016, with 150 runs exactly in the third session on day one, and 196 runs (!!) in the first session of day two, writes Michael Avery. Has it been done in the intervening period? Does anyone remember? Can someone reading the OBO get statsguru to work in a way that I can’t (almost undoubtedly)?107th over: England 375-8 (Sibley 125, Broad 0) A little consolation for Maharaj, as England send Stuart Broad out for what will undoubtedly be some short stuff. Perhaps an unnecessary risk, if he were to break his finger avoiding a snorter. Steve Castle has some succour for those of you without Sky. Thanks Steve. The only highlights I can find which are free are on Sky Sports’ YouTube channel. They’re not exactly exhaustive though, with each day’s play squeezed into five minutes... Curran twonks the third ball of the day straight to midwicket.On Flintoff and Stokes, it is hard to ide the two, I think as some OBOers have said, Flintoff, like Botham before him, didn’t nurture his body as he might have, so his career peak was relatively short. But Stokes is of a different era, his body is not his problem, unless it crumbles from over-use.Bad news for Pat Brown who had been due to play in the Big Bash. He has a lower back stress fracture, so has been withdrawn from England’s ODI squad.This lovely tribute was sitting in my inbox, from Simon Darvill.Had the silly bugger not died a couple of weeks before Christmas, today would have been my dad’s 75th birthday. He was a long time club cricketeer who bowled a deceptive short run up right arm medium pace filler, competent with the bat and who actively chose to filed at silly mid offon in an age before helmets and protection. He was an avid Northantamptonshire (or just “The County” as they were known in our house) supporter and Test watcher. He was ambivalent to the allure of short form cricket (“I was playing 2020 years ago - all those evening games we played, what were they but 2020?”).Why do I tell you this? First because he would be absolutely loving this display of batting this morning and second to say thanks to him for giving me my love of cricket. For all the Sunday afternoons spent on the boundaries of cricket clubs around the Midlands, for all the hours watching Test matches and for taking me to see the County play Hampshire in the John Player League and getting to see Gordon Greenidge play in the flesh (even if his display was far from stellar that day). Cheers Dad.An unsuccessful lunch interval.  I lost a couple of games of magnetic darts to my eleven year old and also failed to find the answer to a question a couple of you have written in to ask. Are there any terrestrial highlights of this series? I’m spoilt by having Sky, but can’t find any evidence of them online. Can anyone help?What a session for England! A wonderful debut century for Sibley - Mike Atherton has just outstatted most by calling it the first Test hundred for an England opener at Newlands since Jack Hobbs in 1910. He compares Sibley’s powers of concentration with Alastair Cook - early days, but high praise. And Ben Stokes? An eye-popping, tongue-clicking, head-blowing cameo. Time for a quick stretch, back in a jiffy.106th over: England 375-7 (Sibley 125, Curran 13) Delight for England, and a broad smile from Stuart Broad on the balcony, as a ball from Pretorius spits off the pitch and hits Sam Curran’s top hand. Curran sends a four square and that is that. South Africa will now have to make the highest score in Test history to win the game. England lead 421, 157 runs in the session. Sibley is applauded off the pitch for the best lunch of his lifetime.105th over: England 368-7 (Sibley 125, Curran 6) I’m not sure how they measure this but Maharaj is getting more turn over the wicket than around. At least I think that’s right, they whipped the stat away very quickly. Anyway, Curran flays him through the covers for four. Time, with lunch approaching, to chew over a declaration? Lead 414.104th over: England 362-7 (Sibley 124, Curran 1) Nortje sends down four byes high and getting higher over a ducking Sam Curran and then over the head of a leaping de Kock. Not a happy bowler. Stokes v Flintoff, take 2: Dylan Pugh.I think although they’re both obviously the premier pace allrounders of the time for England, their skillsets are very different.It boils down to the fact that Stokes is a world class bat who is a useful change bowler, whereas Flintoff was a world-class bowler, and a more than useful bat.You could make the argument that Freddie was the more naturally gifted of the two, but stokes ha a bigger hunger for runs. I’m not convinced Freddie would have always made the team as a bat, and Stokes has played more and more tests as a pure batsman.And take three: Avitaj Mitra.On the whole, I agree with Chris. Stokes for me, is still a batsman who bowls while when I think of Freddie, it is as someone who was a very reliable third choice bowler capable of the odd brilliant innings.Similarities between the two of course being that both have played starring roles in one Ashes series each.When I am asked to recall Stokes’ memorable performances, 2 or 3 immediately come to mind while for Freddie it was just the 2005 Ashes. (To be fair, what a sensational series that was)One thing we will never know however, is whether Stokes would have had the same effect that Freddie did, against “that” Aussie team of bonafide legends. My personal view is no.To conclude:Average Stokes \u0026gt Average Flintoff (without a doubt)Peak Flintoff \u0026gt Peak Stokes (but only just)Buttler tries to scoop but it was too short and the ball falls into the gloves of de Kock. Short but glorious.103rd over: England 356-6 (Sibley 123, Buttler 23) Sibley fine-edges Rabada for four and with that the England lead passes a stately 400. 102nd over: England 350-6 (Sibley 119, Buttler 23) Just the 14 from Nortje’s over as Buttler practises his stand and swivel. The sweetest hook for six, some pulls interspersed with a couple of drives. Despite what he said the other day, Buttler looks in very good nick indeed.Ok Flintoff v Stokes, take one: Will Padmore.In regards to Chris Goater’s question the bowling stats are actually very close. Flintoff has a lower bowling average (32.78 v 33.13) and better economy (2.97 v 3.34) but Stokes has more 5 wicket hauls (4 v 3) and a better strike rate (59.4 v 66.1). I’m not sure anyone would argue that Flintoff was a better batsman, I suspect it was telling that there was no real thought of him continuing as a batsman when bowling became so problematic.  I would also agree with Gough on the fitness point, I always felt that the shape Flintoff got himself in for the boxing match that he fought post retirement showed that he could have made more of an effort to look after himself more whilst playing (was he trying to emulate Beefy off the pitch as well as on?). Having said all of that being too young to have seen Botham in action, both Flintoff and Stokes are two of my all time favourites and have brought me much joy! 101st over: England 338-6 (Sibley 119, Buttler 9) Hey Jos, watch this! Sibley hauls himself down on one knee and sweeps Maharaj for SIX with casual violence. Next ball Maharaj fights back with an arm ball to get Sibley in a tangle, before Sibley responds with another sweep, this time for four. 100th over: England 327-6 (Sibley 109, Buttler 8) Nortje comes into the attack for the first time today and Buttler off-drives him for six! Like you do. Casually, in his tracksuit bottoms, skulking round the corner shop for a morning pick-me-up lucozade.

But all Colman did was sit in a chair looking glum When it comes to television, the Golden Globes have a long history of getting it wrong. Last year it awarded best comedy to The Kominsky Method, for example. The year before that it went to The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. Two years before that the HFPA cast its gaze across the comedy landscape and inexplicably decided that nothing was better than Mozart in the Jungle.With this in mind, you’d be forgiven for thinking something went badly wrong at the Golden Globes last night because, well, its winners were our winners too. Best drama? Succession, which came first in the ’s best TV of 2019 poll. Best comedy? Fleabag, which came second. Best miniseries? Chernobyl, which came third. The acting awards lined up nicely with this, too Succession’s Brian Cox won best drama actor, Phoebe Waller-Bridge won best comedy actress and Stellan Skarsgård won best supporting actor.Even when our tastes erged, it was hard to disagree with the results. FosseVerdon was a flawed series, but it nevertheless hinged on Michelle Williams’ totally committed performance, and she was awarded appropriately. Only a handful of people watched Ramy, Ramy Youssef’s autobiographical Hulu comedy, but it was received so well that his win for best comedy actor came as a happy surprise. Even parts of Ricky Gervais’s monologue – the lines about Apple’s sweatshops in particular – were on point. What on Earth is going on?All this leaves me in something of a dilemma. This is supposed to be the piece where I pull the Golden Globes apart for their poor taste, and revel in all their bad decisions. But I broadly agreed with everything, which puts me in a sticky position. So – and I am truly sorry to do this – it falls to me to take the nuclear option. OK, deep breath.Olivia Colman should not have won her Golden Globe.I know. I know. It’s Olivia Colman. She is spectacular in everything, and she’s been spectacular for so long that we’ve come to expect a baseline of excellence from her. Everybody loves Olivia Colman. I love Olivia Colman. Last year was a triumph for her. She was excellent in BBC One’s Les Miserables. She was amazing in Fleabag. The woman won an Oscar last year, for god’s sake.But I don’t think she deserved to win for The Crown. First, let’s look at who she was up against. She beat Nicole Kidman, who held the second season of Big Little Lies together with her complex portrayal of a woman grieving a man she helped to murder. She beat Jodie Comer, who managed to be even more dazzling and confident in the second season of Killing Eve than she was in the first, which nobody thought possible. She beat Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston for their respective roles in The Morning Show, even though Aniston gave one of the performances of the year.Meanwhile, Colman sat in a chair. Yes, they were nice chairs. And yes, sometimes they were in different places. And, true, sometimes she did more than sit in a chair. Sometimes she looked out of windows. Sometimes, when something made her furious beyond all comprehension, she very infinitesimally flared her nostrils. But that’s all.This isn’t a failing of Colman. It’s a failing of The Crown for underusing her, and a failing of Queen Elizabeth II for not being more demonstrative. Had the material been there, Colman would have clearly given a world’s best performance. But it wasn’t, so she spent an entire series of television sitting on her thumb. What a waste of a brilliant performer.So Olivia Colman shouldn’t have won her Golden Globe, but it’s Olivia Colman so I’m glad she did. Hopefully next year the Golden Globes will go back to being terrible so I have something more substantial to write about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2be75dcdd7a1d5f554cd53da6f6fc7f540b27e77/0_220_5226_3134/master/5226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eb88282c186b2ee23b58362bc0b6d5e","title":"us citizens in iraq tell us about your situation","story":"We’d like to hear from US citizens in Iraq about their situation following embassy advice to leave the country. Share your stories The American Embassy in Baghdad is calling for all US citizens in Iraq to leave the country as soon as possible.In the early hours of 3 January, Iran’s most powerful general Qassem Suleimani was killed outside Baghdad airport in an airstrike sanctioned by the US President, Donald Trump. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, de-facto leader of the Iranian-backed Iraqi militia, the Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU), and close associate of Suleimani, also died in the attack.The killing represents a significant acceleration in the escalation of tensions between the US and Iran. It followed just hours after the conclusion of a two-day siege against the US embassy in Baghdad by PMU militants, which was prompted by a US airstrike camps belonging to a PMU-affiliated militia, itself a response to that group’s killing of a US contractor at an Iraqi army base.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has sworn revenge for Suleimani’s death.The embassy said in a statement that it “urges American Citizens to heed the January 2020 Travel Advisory and depart Iraq immediately.

The regional shellfish committee, the CRC, says almost half the oyster farms in the south Brittany region – 150 out of a total of 330 – are affected by the bans.Philippe Le Gal, the president of the regional CRC said: “The gastroenteritis phenomenon has been around since Christmas. The sewage isn’t always properly treated by the purification plants and the virus ends up in the sea, especially after the rains we have had.” He called for the local authorities to investigate the cause of the contamination.“This is a real economic and human disaster imposed on us by a state that is incapable of protecting our magnificent coastline,” it wrote.Le Gal told Ouest-France newspaper: “The (fishing and farming) zones at potential risk have been closed. Suspect oyster batches have been withdrawn from sale. Those that remain don’t pose a risk. Now we have to understand what’s going on.”The producers have blamed local officials who “boast of welcoming more and more residents and tourists, signing building permits with a vengeance while forgetting to take care of the management of human waste and sanitation.“Astronomical quantities of polluted water are poured into the sea without raising the eyebrows of the authorities and are poisoning our coasts and oysters, which are now laden with the human gastroenteritis virus, norovirus. The water of the Morbihan coast is now unhealthy. Oyster farmers and their coastline are dying in total indifference,” they wrote.The local police prefect said it was a temporary crisis caused by an unusual combination of low temperatures and heavy rains, which had caused sewage overflows into local rivers.Patrice Faure told Agence France-Presse he would be meeting the agriculture minister to call for a speeding up of research to find a “rapid decontamination process” for the oyster farms and to discuss compensation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3843d11f3b6db8a1773c12a2bcaef5bee881364/0_146_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e1504b1c808d4282005bf5f898dcefc","title":"croatia elects leftist zoran milanovic to be next president","story":"Zoran Milanović wins runoff against conservative incumbent after election trail marked by rightward shift Croatia’s newly elected centre-left president has pledged to make the country a more tolerant place after denying a second term to the rightwing incumbent, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović.“If this narrow but fair and clear victory brought a little faith and a little spirit into this society of ours and among these people, I am a happy man, and let us rejoice together!” Milanović told a crowd at his campaign headquarters in Zagreb on Sunday evening.A former prime minister from the Social Democrat party, Milanović has promised to turn the page on the country’s wartime past, and advocated for Croatia becoming a “normal country” during his campaign.“Let’s be united in (our) differences,” the 53-year-old told his supporters on Sunday. “Four million of us … are looking for our place in Europe which is, despite all the problems, the nicest place to live, the most peaceful project in which Croatia must find its place and interest,” he said.On Sunday evening, Grabar-Kitarović conceded defeat and promised a “civilised transfer” of power to Milanović. The Croatian presidency is a largely symbolic role, but analysts said the shift to the right during the campaign had threatened to poison public debate.Grabar-Kitarović, who rose to international prominence during Croatia’s run to the World Cup final in Russia in 2018, had initially been favourite to win the race, but ran an uncertain campaign marred by gaffes. Her campaign veered into hard-right territory in order to see off the first-round challenge of a nationalist singer, Miroslav Škoro, but in the end failed to unite the country’s right wing.She had based her campaign around patriotism and pride in Croatian history, and made references to the 1990s wars during her campaign. She also received a controversial endorsement from Julienne Busić, who was jailed together with her husband after hijacking a passenger flight from New York to Chicago in 1976 to draw attention to Croatian demands for independence from Yugoslavia. Grabar-Kitarović’s HDZ party ran videos of the endorsement, drawing criticism.The HDZ is split between centre-right and hard-right elements, and analysts said it was possible that Grabar-Kitarović’s defeat could lead the party to move back towards the centre ahead of parliamentary elections later this year. Such a move is favoured by Andrej Plenković, the HDZ prime minister. Speaking on Monday, Plenković said his party would analyse the result to understand why it lost.Milanović was prime minister from 2011 to 2016, and overcame a reputation as an out-of-touch elitist to win the presidential vote. Analysts attributed his victory as much to a protest vote against Grabar-Kitarović as an endorsement of his candidacy.He will take charge of the country during Croatia’s EU presidency, a period in which the bloc’s agenda is likely to be dominated by the post-Brexit fallout and debate over whether the EU should press ahead with enlargement plans and take in Croatia’s fellow western Balkan states.Croatia was the last country to join the EU, in 2013, and this is the first time it has held the presidency."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11d83851f3eac62c431bc58c2147403798802d49/0_714_1670_1001/master/1670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6ce9dc1268c19153a8783181604df2e","title":"no 10 uk would not back us bombing of iranian cultural sites","story":"Downing Street says such military action would break international treaties in implicit rebuke to TrumpDowning Street has said targeting cultural sites in Iran would breach international warfare conventions in an implicit rebuke to Donald Trump for threatening to bomb protected heritage sites.Boris Johnson’s official spokesman refused to criticise Trump directly but made clear the UK government would not support such a course of action, after the US president said he could target 52 Iranian sites if Iran retaliated over the assassination of Qassem Suleimani – “some at a very high level and important to Iran and the Iranian culture”.Trump’s comments amount to threatening a war crime because such action would violate international treaties, but he repeated the threat on Sunday, saying: “They’re allowed to kill our people, they’re allowed to torture and maim our people, they’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people, and we’re not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It doesn’t work that way.”Responding to Trump’s latest comments, Johnson’s spokesman said there were “international conventions in place that prevent the destruction of cultural heritage”, implying the UK does not believe such threats would be carried out.“You can read the international conventions for yourself. It is the 1954 Hague convention for the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict,” he added.However, Downing Street was careful not to criticise Trump directly, insisting that Britain’s security partnership with the US remains “very close” despite Johnson not having been informed of America’s assassination of Suleimani in advance.The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “We have a very close security partnership with the United States, we are in regular dialogue at every level.”Asked if Johnson was convinced the US drone strike was legal, the spokesman said: “States have a right to take action such as this in self defence and the US have been clear that Suleimani was plotting imminent attacks on American diplomats and military personnel.”The spokesman also defended Johnson’s failure to make any sort of statement on the assassination for 68 hours while he was holidaying with his partner on the Caribbean island of Mustique.“The PM was in contact with senior officials and senior ministers throughout the course of Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The government’s position was set out by the foreign secretary,” he said.The prime minister spoke to Trump, as well as Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, on Sunday. The UK, Germany and France issued a joint statement urging deescalation and restraint by all parties late on Sunday night.Johnson also spoke to the Iraqi prime minister on Monday morning, and urged him to allow foreign troops to remain in the country to fight against the threat posed by Islamic State.“The foreign secretary spoke to the Iraqi president and prime minister this weekend.

The scale and enormity of your offending confirms this as an accurate description.The judge continued: Rarely, if ever, have the courts seen such a campaign of rape as this, covering so many victims over a prolonged period.She said the true scale of Sinaga\u0027s offending may never be known but that police appeared to have established 195 men were filmed by the defendant while unconscious.Reynhard Sinaga carried out most of the rapes in the bedroom of his Manchester flatSinaga, the son of a wealthy banker who moved to Britain in 2007, carried out the rapes in his luxury flat in the heart of Manchester’s vibrant city centre.Targeting students and other young men, he would leave his apartment late at night, homing in on those who looked drunk or vulnerable.After striking up conversation, he would invite them back to his nearby flat, with offers of drinks or the opportunity to charge their phones.Reynhard Sinaga has been jailed for a minimum of 30-yearsOnce there he would spike them with the class C party drug GHB, which would quickly render them unconscious.He would then rape or sexually assault them, often numerous times, filming the attacks on his mobile phone for his own perverted posterity.The vast majority of his victims said they had no recollection of what had happened and believed they had simply passed out in the flat after drinking too much.Reynhard Sinaga lived in Montana House win central ManchesterHis youngest victim was 17 and the oldest 36, and all but three of the 48 victims identified by police, were straight.For two and a half years, barely a week went by when he did not carry out a fresh attack, sometimes raping two different victims in the same weekend.Such was the success of his technique, that he once picked up a victim, just 60 seconds after leaving his apartment.In April 2017 one of his victims went to police after waking up in an unknown room feeling ill and extremely disorientated.He told detectives he had a vague recollection of being sexually assaulted but was unable to recall where he had woken up believing it may have been in a hotel.Police carried out an investigation but after focusing on the Ibis and Pendulum Hotels, failed to make any progress.The attacks took place in Sinaga\u0026#39s apartmentSinaga was eventually caught in June 2017 when his final victim came round during the rape and managed to fight Sinaga off before reporting him to the police.When officers examined his mobile phone and other digital devices they found a vast cache of horrendous footage showing him in the act of raping his victims.Detectives were able to trace many of the victims because Sinaga used social media to look them up after the attacks, sometimes boasting to his friends that the liaisons had been consensual.He only used a condom once, but miraculously he tested negative for HIV or any sexually transmitted diseases.Police believe there could be scores more victims who have not yet been identified and are now appealing for any young men who believe they were targeted by Sinaga to come forward in complete confidence.Sinaga was born in Jambi in Indonesia in 1983 into a wealthy middle class and devoutly Catholic family.Reynhard Sinaga moved to the UK in 2007His father was a banker who later moved into the palm oil business.Sinaga came to the UK on a student visa in 2007, enrolling on an MA in sociology at the University of Manchester.In 2012 he began a PhD in human geography at Leeds University, but remained living in Manchester.The rape investigation is the largest in British legal history and it is the first time prosecutors have split charges across four separate trials.Sinaga prowled the bars and clubs of Manchester\u0026#39s Gay Village Jurors were forced to watch extremely graphic videos showing the attacks, and it was thought the impact of being faced with the full scale of his offending would be too much for one jury to cope with.Sinaga only gave evidence in two of the four trials, but claimed all of the sex had been consensual, despite the fact some of his victims could be heard snoring in the footage.In total Sinaga has been convicted of a 159 charges involving 48 men, including 136 rapes, eight attempted rapes, two assault by penetration and 13 sexual assaults.Assistant Chief Constable Mabs Hussain, of Greater Manchester Police, said: “Reynhard Sinaga is a depraved inidual, who targeted potentially vulnerable men that he had spotted walking on their own after a night out.“To the rest of the world he came across as an engaged member of society who was studying for a PHD qualification and had a small circle of law-abiding friends that he would socialise with.However beneath that façade was a serial sex offender, who we now believe to be Britain’s most prolific rapist. The fact that he was able to cover-up his true nature for so long, just serves as further evidence of his calculating criminal nature.Reynhard Sinaga showed no remorse during any of his four trialsIan Rushton, North West Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor, said: “Reynhard Sinaga is the most prolific rapist in British legal history.“His extreme sense of sexual entitlement almost defies belief and he would no doubt still be adding to his staggering tally had he not been caught. “Sinaga’s unthreatening demeanour duped these young men – many of whom thanked him for his kindness in offering them a place to stay – into thinking this monster was a Good Samaritan.“But once back at his flat he used victims as objects purely for his own gratification – then appears to have derived further twisted pleasure from re-watching his films in court and putting victims through the trauma of giving evidence.”:: Anyone wishing to make a report to the police relating to Sinaga is asked to contact: 0800 092 0410 (calls made from within the UK)  0207158 0124 (international calls).Reports relating to Reyhard Sinaga can also be made online via the Major Incident Public Portal: https:mipp.police.uk operation06GMP19V24-PO2Details of Sinaga\u0026#039s 48 victimsRift develops between UK and US over Iran crisis after No 10 makes clear Donald Trump would commit war crime if he attacks cultural sitesLabour leadership: Tom Watson attacks Rebecca Long-Bailey as \u0026#39continuity candidate\u0026#39 - latest news15-year-old girl pleads guilty to mugging opera singer Katherine JenkinsUkrainian Orthodox Church compares Russia\u0026#39s treatment of believers in Crimea to Stalin-era repressionsComment: Remain\u0026#39s death has left the EU too toxic to embrace, as Jess Phillips has foundIslamic State warning as report reveals jihadists slaughtered 250 civilians in Burkina Faso terror campaignAustralia is burning - but why are the bushfires so bad and is climate change to blame?Chinese New Year 2020: Rats, luck and why you should avoid medicine, laundry and crying childrenAliens exist but we may simply not see them, says first British astronaut into space Qassim Soleimani\u0026#39s daughter warns Trump of \u0026#39dark day\u0026#39 to come as Iranians gather for funeralRussia will do everything it can to exploit withdrawal of US forces amid deepening ties with TehranHarvey Weinstein rape trial set to begin in New YorkThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayMonday morning news briefing: Do not retaliate, Iran warnedIsraelis to protest in support of British teenager as she faces sentencing in Cyprus gang rape caseBinge watching TV addicts treated by Harley Street therapists in first cases of their kind in UKComment: Why living with your mum might not be such a bad ideaNext Labour leader: who are the candidates vying to replace Jeremy Corbyn?Boris Johnson calls for de-escalation from both sides as Trump warns Iran of \u0026#39major retaliation\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/12/30/22/plastic-waste-ocean.jpg","title":"20 pledges 2020 climate change","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.None of us is perfect, so there’s no use virtue-signalling or preachingHow much can any one of us do to make a difference in the climate crisis? We all know the fatalistic logic: the real power lies with the governments of countries such as China, or with the banks that fund the oil industry. What can you or I really achieve with our reusable coffee cups and vegan sausage rolls, other than occupying a rather smug patch of moral high ground, or worse still, creating a comforting illusion that masks the real problem?But there is another point of view. If we take the climate crisis seriously, how can we not want to try, even in some small way, to be part of the solution? Can we really expect the countries and companies that produce the most carbon to change if we don’t show willing to make some small sacrifice in our own lives? And if we all do something, won’t governments and corporations be encouraged to reflect the wishes of the people, even if they are motivated just by winning our votes and taking our money?I’ve sensed this urge to do something while speaking to colleagues recently. And it’s the desire to contribute that has prompted us to create this series of blogs, under the banner “20 Pledges for 2020”. It started on the Lifestyle desk. Did I know, asked one of our staff, that our deputy travel editor was going flight-free for a year? For someone who must receive more invitations for all-expenses-paid trips to the sun than anyone I can name, this was no casual commitment. Then I heard there was a colleague who’s going vegan, and another determined to switch to an electric car. And so the list went on.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe’re not immune to the bigger challenges and responsibilities of the media. During our recent coverage of the UK general election, we set out to make climate the most important theme for our coverage. Looking back, we led our site and our Daily Edition app on climate issues more than any other major British publisher over the same period – no small achievement – but I can’t say we managed to make it our number-one subject it was perhaps inevitable that the NHS and Brexit dominated the political agenda even on our pages. So one of the blogs you’ll see starting over the next few weeks will be from our politics team, pledging to hold politicians to account over the climate.As for me, I’ll be blogging about how The Independent can use its reach and influence to help fight the climate crisis. This was a challenge set for me directly by our environment columnist Donnachadh McCarthy, who is also part of the media team of Extinction Rebellion. I had always been confident that The Independent was not part of the problem. I’m proud to have worked here at the time when Michael McCarthy, our former environment editor, and the late Steve Connor, our science editor, helped to blaze a trail with their reporting and analysis. The natural world was not always such a fashionable cause back then, but you knew they were on to something from the level of pushback we received – even if sometimes it was impossible not to chuckle along.Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

It’s not like we’re The Independent, we can’t just stick a headline saying ‘Cruelty’ and then stick a picture of a dolphin or a whale underneath it. I mean, that’s just cheating, that’s rubbish.” (With apologies to real fans, I’ve filtered out the fruitier adjectives.) It’s amazing to think how recently such large parts of the media were sceptical towards “climate zealots”, and still are.But Donnachadh put a challenge to me a few months ago: when you look at the Indy, is it really clear that we’re living through a crisis? Couldn’t we be doing more? He was right, of course, and we will do more, so I’ll be blogging to keep you up to date with the changes we’re making.There are three phases to climate journalism as far as I can see. First, journalists had a job to do to convince sceptics that the science is right: mankind’s use of fossil fuels is heating our planet. Then there was the second phase: how fast was the world warming, can we limit the rise to 1.5 degrees, 3 degrees, or more? That’s still a crucial debate, and a subject we will continue to track. But the 20 Pledges blogs belong to a third phase: what exactly are we going to do about it – from government policy, financial regulation and international treaties to our own compromises and choices?Before someone helpfully points out the obvious, I realise that none of us writing these blogs is perfect. I’ll start by holding my hand up: for one thing, I fly from our London office to see our US-based staff, just as our reporters often take flights to report on stories around the world, so I’ll be writing more about that in a future blog post.But this project is not about pretending to be perfect, or virtue-signalling, or being diabolically hypocritical, and we certainly aren’t setting out to preach (there’s enough climate puritanism online already). If, or when, we slip up along the way – when the trip to review a new hotel is too tempting, if the smell of a bacon sandwich catches us at a moment of weakness – we’ll write about those times too. So what are we hoping for? We hope it gives us a richer perspective on some of the more important climate stories we cover in 2020, and that by sharing our own experiences we might encourage others to share theirs too. We’ll try to use our voice to encourage change from governments too.You may want to make a pledge yourself and write a blog through the year about it with us, in which case please do get in touch. You can email all of us writing these blogs at 20pledges@, and you’ll find all the blogs, running through the year, appearing at www.news20-pledges.Your pledge may not exactly change the world by itself, but if you share your story, you never know whose mind you might change along the way.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s almost one a week. Let that sink in for a moment.It wasn’t done intentionally – but, perhaps even worse, completely obliviously. Every other weekend, off I trotted, to Moscow, Doha, Rome and the rest, usually for no more than a weekend at a time. I could say that I excused my high flying lifestyle – pun very much intended – by arguing that it was all for work. With the best will in the world, being a travel journalist was always going to involve a certain amount of travel.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut, sadly, that would be giving me way too much credit. The truth is, I didn’t excuse it at all. It never even crossed my mind that I needed to.\u0026nbspUntil, of course, a previously unimaginable and unprecedented shift in the public perception of flying started to emerge. The first time I really realised that a sea change was coming was Emma Thompson’s much-publicised fall from grace, when she flew 5,400 miles from LA to London in the spring to participate in the Extinction Rebellion demonstrations that were bringing the capital to a standstill. The actor and activist was pilloried by the Right and Left in equal measure (the former labelling her a hypocrite, the latter asserting they didn’t need her carbon-tainted help, thank you very much).Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

Extreme downpours in Carlisle in the winter of 2015 saw the previous record flood level being eclipsed by two feetHebden Bridge in West Yorkshire has flooded repeatedly in the past decade, with the worst coming on Christmas Day 2015. Toby Smith of Climate Visuals, an organisation focused on improving how climate change is depicted in the media, says: Extreme weather and flooding, has and will become more frequent due to climate change. An increase in the severity and distribution of press images, reports and media coverage across the nation has localised the issue. It has raised our emotions, perception and personalised the effects and hazards of climate change.Out west in Somerset, floods in 2013 led to entire villages being cut off and isolated for weeksIn summer 2012, intense rain flooded over 8000 properties. In 2013, storms and coastal surges combined catastrophically with elevated sea levels whilst December 2015, was the wettest month ever recorded. Major flooding events continued through the decade with the UK government declaring flooding as one of the nation\u0027s major threats in 2017,  says Mr Smith of Climate VisualsWeather has been more extreme in Britain in recent years. The \u0027Beast from the East\u0027 which arrived in February 2018 brought extraordinarily cold temperatures and high snowfall. Central London (pictured), where the city bustle tends to mean that snow doesn\u0027t even settle, was covered in inches of snow for dayMonths after the cold snap, a heatwave struck Britain, rendering the normally plush green of England\u0027s parks in Summer a parched brown for weeksWorsening droughts in many countries have been disastrous for crop yields and have threatened livestock. In Australia, where a brutal drought persisted for months last year, farmers have suffered from mental health problems because of the threat to their livelihoodEven dedicated climate skeptic Jeremy Clarkson has come to recognise the threat of climate change after visiting the Tonle Sap lake system in Cambodia. Over a million people rely on the water of Tonle Sap for work and sustinence but, as Mr Clarkson witnessed, a drought has severley depleted the water levelIn reaction to these harbingers of climate obliteration, some humans have taken measures to counter the impending disaster. Ethiopia recently planted a reported 350 million trees in a single day Morocco has undertaken the most ambitious solar power scheme in the world, recently completing a solar plant the size of San FranciscoElectric cars are taking off as a viable alternative to fossil fuel burning vehicles and major cities across the world are adding charging points to accomodateCities around the world are embracing cycling too, as a clean (and healthy) mode of transport. The Netherlands continues to lead the way with bikes far outnumbering peopleCycling infrastructure is taking over cities the world over, in the hope of reducing society\u0027s dependency on polluting vehiclesDespite positive steps being taken, humans continue to have a wildly adverse effect on the climate. There have been numerous major oil spills this decade, the most notable being the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010More recently, large swathes of the Amazon rainforest were set alight by people to clear land for agricultureThis decade may have seen horrors but it has led to an understanding that the next decade must see change if human life is to continueI remember feeling nonplussed by the whole thing. What was the big deal? She was using her platform to add clout to a much-needed protest demanding action on the coming climate crisis. Surely that was a good thing?It wasn’t long afterwards that I heard of the flygskam (flight shame) and tågskryt (train brag) movements for the first time. Originating in Sweden and publicised by high-profile figures including Olympic athlete Bjorn Ferry and opera singer Malena Ernman, mother of teenage activist Greta Thunberg, the idea was to make the notion of flying something a little unsavoury – something you might not want to admit to doing in polite company. On the flip side, the “train brag” movement is all about celebrating rail travel, with participants posting pictures and videos of their beauty-filled overland journeys on social media.Meet the people who’ve given up flyingThe concept has even made its way over the North Sea, as I discovered when I came across the Flight Free UK movement. Founder Anna Hughes’ original aim was to get 100,000 people to sign up and pledge to stay grounded for a whole year.\u0026nbsp“I haven’t flown for about 10 years,” she said, “but given the situation we’re now in, I felt like it wasn’t enough to reduce my own carbon footprint – I needed to open it up and do more. And it took over my life!”I didn’t really expect to be joining the swelling ranks of do-gooders, to be perfectly honest. As journalists, we can easily become accomplished fantasists, convincing ourselves that we are somehow set apart from reality – here to observe and report, rather than participate.But something changed in me after I spoke to Anna, along with a number of other committed non-flyers. They were, to a fault, impassioned and persuasive yet polite and non-judgemental. They were happy to take on huge personal expense and inconvenience, all in the hopes that it might help save the only habitable planet we’ve got. A seed was planted in my brain which grew – slowly but unstoppably – day by day, and has already led to me significantly cutting down on the number\u0026nbspof flights I took in the latter half of 2019.Now, it’s time to take the next step: a year of keeping both feet on the ground. Far from being some po-faced exercise in restraint, more than anything I hope this experience will prove that travel, in all its adventurous, erse and mind-opening glory, is not only possible with clipped wings, but can even be enhanced by taking it slow.I produced somewhere in the region of 6,000kg of CO2 from flying in 2019. Here’s to it being 0kg in 2020.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s time to start asking what the sporting world can do to prevent global warmingIn 2020 The Independent will be doing more than ever before to try and make the world a better place. When it comes to sport, that’s easier said than done.Sport is our escape, a way to block out the realities of everyday life for 90 minutes, or a few hours, maybe even an entire day. It is supposed to be enjoyed even in defeat, and yet not even sport is exempt from the greatest threat to humankind today: global warming and the negative impact of climate change.But not even sport can continue to ignore the perils that will come to threaten its very existence unless something is done to change the path it is on. After all, how will our children and grandchildren play football, rugby or cricket if there are no parks left, or will the next Lewis Hamilton be uncovered if we can’t find a sustainable way to maintain motorsport without the use of oil, petrol and even electricity?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis year we will be delving into how sport affects the surrounding environment, exposing the shocking truths of how it is damaging the world as we know it and highlighting the ways people are trying to bring change for the better.Why will we be doing this? Whether your outlook on global warming is akin to Greta Thunberg or Donald Trump, the truth is that sport has one of the biggest impacts on climate change. Whether it’s the Arsenal squad using a private jet to fly to Norwich, or single-use plastic being used at just about every stadium across the globe, there are endless examples of ignorance when it comes to helping the environment.There will be positives, too. What is Formula E doing to inspire change not just in motorsport but in our everyday commute? What inspired Forest Green Rovers to become the world’s first 100 per cent vegan football club? And are extreme adrenaline sports the answer – they tend to go hand in hand with being at one with the world around us in an effort not to damage it.And if we are to cover all areas of this subject, we will have to take a close look at ourselves too: the media. Is it right that journalists travel all year round aboard the most environmentally damaging transport available in automotive vehicles and aeroplanes, throwing away countless notebooks instead of recycling? If we are to ask the difficult questions, we have to be prepared to answer them too.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The demographic\u0026nbsptimebomb is well known — even if no one has adequately dealt with it — and the vast global debt burden of $188 trillion (£143 trillion) is unlikely to be an issue this year as low as interest rates remain low, as most forecasters expect.But deglobalisation is proving to be a major threat to the global economy. Societe\u0026nbspGenerale\u0026nbsp(Soc Gen) has warned that financial globalisation is at a “tipping point”, highlighting the possibility of stagnation and even a slow decline in production links between economies.‘Alarm bells ring’ as factory output falls at fastest rate in 7 yearsSoc Gen, which forecasts global growth slowing from 3.2 per cent to 3.1 per cent between 2020 and 2021, says financial globalisation has slowed significantly. Annual cross-border capital flows have decreased by more than 60 per cent compared to the peak in 2007.There is a similar problem with the trade in goods.

Searches for a number of other related terms threw up similar results.Carolyn Harris, a Labour MP and chair of a cross-party group on gambling-related harm, said the adverts were immoral.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Gambling companies pay referral fees to intermediaries who can find new customers that may turn into lucrative regular players.Online gambling group 888 takes £15m punt on BetBrightTom Watson labels problem gambling as a ‘public health emergency’Will bookies millions to address problem gambling buy off critics?This week, the extent to which gambling companies’ multibillion-pound profits rely on problem gamblers was revealed in a report obtained , which showed that one firm collected 83 per cent of its deposits from just 2 per cent of its customers.A Google spokesperson said: “We support responsible gambling advertising and it’s important to us that people see useful and relevant ads in this area.\u0026nbsp“As such, we have strict policies around gambling ads, which we enforce rigorously. We have suspended the accounts in question.”The company says it uses a combination of humans and algorithms to vet adverts and enforce its rules.But on Friday, after Google provided a statement, at least one gambling advert was still showing close to the top of search results for Gamstop“Don’t miss the chance to have fun again,” the advert read.\u0026nbsp”Find the best sites not on Gamstop\u0026nbsphere.”Gambling adverts have been inappropriately placed on Google searches before. In October, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned an ad for a casino app which targeted customers who googled “How to unsubscribe from all gambling”.Trade body the Betting and Gaming Council called on Google and other search engines to update their gambling blacklists to prevent similar problems emerging again in future.Anyone who sees gambling adverts targeting search results for help with addiction is advised to contact industry regulator the Gambling Commission.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Undergraduates aged between 18 and 19 are 25 per cent less likely to be in work than they were in the early 2000s.\u0026nbspMs Gardiner added: “With young people today expected to end their working lives at a later age than previous generations, it\u0027s understandable that they want to start their working lives at a later age too.“But this lack of work experience can create longer-term problems, particularly if they hit other life milestones like motherhood or ill-health before their careers have got off the ground.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Searches for a number of other related terms threw up similar results.Carolyn Harris, a Labour MP and chair of a cross-party group on gambling-related harm, said the adverts were immoral.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Gambling companies pay referral fees to intermediaries who can find new customers that may turn into lucrative regular players.Online gambling group 888 takes £15m punt on BetBrightTom Watson labels problem gambling as a ‘public health emergency’Will bookies millions to address problem gambling buy off critics?This week, the extent to which gambling companies’ multibillion-pound profits rely on problem gamblers was revealed in a report obtained , which showed that one firm collected 83 per cent of its deposits from just 2 per cent of its customers.A Google spokesperson said: “We support responsible gambling advertising and it’s important to us that people see useful and relevant ads in this area.\u0026nbsp“As such, we have strict policies around gambling ads, which we enforce rigorously. We have suspended the accounts in question.”The company says it uses a combination of humans and algorithms to vet adverts and enforce its rules.But on Friday, after Google provided a statement, at least one gambling advert was still showing close to the top of search results for Gamstop“Don’t miss the chance to have fun again,” the advert read.\u0026nbsp”Find the best sites not on Gamstop\u0026nbsphere.”Gambling adverts have been inappropriately placed on Google searches before. In October, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned an ad for a casino app which targeted customers who googled “How to unsubscribe from all gambling”.Trade body the Betting and Gaming Council called on Google and other search engines to update their gambling blacklists to prevent similar problems emerging again in future.Anyone who sees gambling adverts targeting search results for help with addiction is advised to contact industry regulator the Gambling Commission.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In doing so, they claim to have created the world\u0027s most efficient lithium-sulfur battery.“The world needs radical new\u0026nbspenergy storage technologies to fight climate change,” Dr Mahdokht\u0026nbspShaibani\u0026nbspfrom Monash University’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, who led the research, told\u0026nbspThe Independent. “Lithium-sulfur batteries, which use extremely high-capacity sulfur, can store five-times as much capacity as traditional lithium-ion batteries, and are made from cheap materials that are available worldwide.”Associate Professor Matthew Hill added: “This approach not only favours high performance metrics and long life cycle... it is also can lead to significant reductions in environmentally hazardous waste.”Battery breakthrough revolutionises recharge times for electric carsThe research, which is published in\u0026nbspScience Advances, could be a major milestone for the battery industry and could impact everything from consumer electronics to solar grids.Dr Shaibani\u0026nbspsaid the commercialisation of the batteries may be between two to four years away, and a\u0026nbsppatent for the manufacturing process has already been approved.Prototype cells have been developed in Germany and further testing in cars and solar grids is set to take place in Australia this year.“Cost projections and performance metrics of our technology predicts for outperforming today’s lithium-ion batteries at high competitive price points,” said Dr Shaibani.\u0026nbsp“Altogether, this means that solar power could be much more easily stored, or an electric vehicle go a lot further, but more importantly, the battery is safe, simple and ethical.”​Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s nothing more than a teachers’ tax.“It is shocking that the Tories want to give the cold shoulder to EU staff after Brexit when we are in the middle of a teacher recruitment crisis.”The “tax” – adding up to £4,345 over five years\u0026nbsp– will be imposed because of two separate changes planned by Mr Johnson’s government, the Lib Dems have calculated.From next year, EU citizens are set to require visas to come to work in the UK. Teachers from outside the EU need a Tier 2\u0026nbspvisa, which costs £1,220 if it is for more than 3 years.Created with Sketch.General election 2019: How the night unfolded Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.227 11.28pm - First result to be announcedLabour holds Newcastle Central, albeit with a reduced majority, in the first result to be announced in the 2019 General ElectionThe Conservatives gain Blyth Valley, in the North East, from Labour in the first big upset of the night.

No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle.

(RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. Another verse includes the lyrics: “You never cared about grime, you just used it  Worse than Ed with your watered down music.”Stormzy is yet to respond to the diss track, but in a recent interview he likened Wiley to a “drunk uncle” who should “get back to bed”.Wiley, hailed by many as the “godfather of grime”, has taken aim at a number of fellow rappers over the years, including AJ Tracey who he recently mocked for his hit “Ladbroke Grove”, which is a nod to old-school garage music.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He designed it, built it then realised it was far too savage and bitey to live in, say, Milton Keynes.Or the poisonous redback spider which likes to hide under lavatory seats so it can bite a man’s penis when he sits down to do his number twos. No way could God have that living in Europe or the US.He also made a lot of snakes. Some are very pretty and some are very impressive.But occasionally it all went wrong and he ended up with something that could kill a fully-grown man with one small bite. And again, these could not live in populated areas.He needed a home for all these things, so he made Australia.And to make sure people didn’t go there, he put a huge coral reef on the approaches and filled the interior with a sea of sand that goes on for ever.He even used this remote outpost to house some of his more ridiculous ideas. Stuff he came up with when he was drunk.Like those birds that can’t fly and that otter with a beak.Then you have the kangaroo, which gets about by bouncing, and the koala, which is permanently stoned and catches chlamydiaanyone ever picks it up.For millions of years, this big, sandy cupboard under the stairs went unnoticed.But then along came Captain Cook and now the world knows all about Oz and its stupid, dangerous creatures.Plainly, God is embarrassed. Because he’s decided to set fire to it.It’s been argued the fires raging across the country were caused by global warming or out-of-control barbies.But when you look at the footage, you know something biblical is going on.Those things are huge.Skies have been turned red by the flames. Choking smoke is blanketing millions of acres.Thousands of homes have been obliterated. And people are dying.This has happened before in recent years and there’s no doubt it will happen again.Which means people must accept that Australia isn’t meant for human habitation.Soyou’re reading this down there, please come home.You’ll like it. It never stops raining. And we are better at sport.DURING World War Two, General de Gaulle used London as a base and to say a belated thank you, current president Emmanuel Macron is thinking of giving the city France’s highest award for honour.Needless to say, lots of people are now jumping up and down in Paris saying the Legion d’Honneur cannot possibly be given to London as England and France are “hereditary enemies”.No we aren’t. Germany is our hereditary enemy and not just on the football pitch.France, meanwhile, is just some place we visit to buy cheese and wine.We have no idea what it’s like to fight France because it always surrenders before the battle’s got going.ALL of us begin a new decade with hope in our hearts that it’ll be better than the past one.Not me. This is thanks to two things.Firstly, there’s Libya. Since they shoved a scaffolding pole up Colonel Gaddafi’s bottom, it has been a lawless haven for terrorists and lunatics.Today it’s run by factions of the Judean People’s Front and the Popular Front For Judea, with one backed by Turkey and Qatar and the other backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.There’s going to be a bloodbath. And this is a country less than  miles from mainland Europe.Which means we are going to have to get involved. Becausewe don’t, Russia will.That’s one reason, then, that I fear for the coming decade.The other is that at some point in the next ten years, statistically speaking, I am likely to die.TWENTY years ago, Britain created the perfect argument for not allowing anything to be nationalised or run by the Government.It was called The Dome.Created to mark the end of a millennium, it cost £million and was filled by right-on frizzy haired vegans with things no one wanted to see.There was a plastic human you could walk through, a multi-faith zone and lots of global warming malarkey.Unsurprisingly, it was a spectacular flop.So after a year, it was given away to a property company which turned it into the O, a music venue that now rakes in £million a year. Led Zeppelin had their reunion there.As I’ve always said, governments should put up park benches and run the nuclear submarines.And that’s it. Everything  should be run by the private sector.AS we all trudge back to work, with the fog making our hair frizzy and the puddles reminding us we need some new shoes, we will develop a teeth-rattling hatred for all those celebrities on Instagram who are frolicking in the Caribbean or sipping green juices on a beach in the Males.Amanda Holden. Pippa Middleton. Myleene Klass. Grrrr.Except,you think about it, you and I don’t have to find someone to put sun cream on our back five times a day.We aren’t being eaten alive by mosquitoes. And while a wet pavement isn’t very romantic, it’s better than hopping about, yelping, on a superheated white beach.Also, we will not have dicky tummies from the weird food, bad heads from the cocktails, puffy eyes from the jet lag and the constant worry we’ve been papped while bending over.And what’s more, we didn’t have to spend half an hour at an airport waiting for someone in a high-visibility jacket to take an X-ray photograph of our genitals.TECHNICALLY speaking, the fabulous goal scored by Wolves against Liverpool last weekend was not a goal at all.Because careful examination of the footage showed one of the players involved in the build-up was offside by .mm.It may have been three in the morning. The road may have been empty and the skies clear. And there’s no way you should have to waste a day on a speed awareness course as a result.But technology means we live in a time when there is no grey area. Pity.Many of the kids were explaining how they’d given up meat to save the planet and that Greta Thunberg may be Mrs Jesus.But then, instead of actually going walking, they stayed in the car, running its V diesel engine to keep warm.I WAS asked the other dayI’d be starting the year by doing Veganuary.FINALLY, may I wish everyone a very happy New Year.And extend a big thank you to Jeremy Corbyn and Diane Abbott for making such a thing likely.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it had to act rapidly.Iranian reprisals may be inevitable.But standing back hasn’t done the West much good.The mullahs at least now need to factor in a US President who’s more ruthless than the last.Three days ago Ayatollah Khamenei taunted him over the storming of the US embassy in Baghdad. “You can’t do anything,” he sneered.Trump’s put him straight there.  WHAT is this spell Labour’s Jess Phillips casts over Blairites and media pundits  We don’t get it.We do not doubt her hard work, nor that her heart is in the right place.Many naively believe her Brummie accent makes her the true voice of the working-class — this middle-class, grammar-schooled daughter of an NHS executive and a teacher.But that’s not our real beef. It’s the toe-curling, overwrought Commons monologues designed for social media.And the needlessly vitriolic and hysterical Twitter rants.Consider this gem: “The greatest lie ever told is that Boris is likeable, with cut-through outside ­London.” That aged well, as they say.Phillips may yet be Labour’s best hope as leader, God help them.But to be seen as a serious politician, she should start acting like one. IT is obvious the teenager convicted of lying about her gang-rape in Cyprus signed a bogus dictated confession under duress.Its dodgy English smacks of a foreign cop, not an articulate young Brit.The Foreign Office must act.

If she’s really troubled about racism in the Labour Party, why did she spend the past three years campaigning to get anti-Semitic Jeremy Corbyn into Number  Andshe’s a serious contender for the leadership, why does she spend half her time doing interviews about herself for glossy magazines Yes, personal brand is important. Butthe country is really in the state Jess claims, shouldn’t she be busy fixing it The Labour leadership contender is determined to paint herself as “likeable” and “relatable” but, right now, she’s coming across as a vacuous narcissist. And a slippery one at that.The race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn has so far involved the candidates hamming up their northern accents, trying to out-working class each other, or desperately bigging up their woke credentials to the Press.No one has yet adopted a whippet or done a Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP and potential leadership hopeful who this week described herself out as “pansexual” — attracted to people regardless of sex — but it won’t be long now.For the casual bystander, it all makes for a good laugh. Emily Thornberry’s hysterical claim that her family was once so poor they had to put down a cat sounded so ridiculous in her cut-glass accent, it distracted commentators fromAngela Rayner’s far more legitimate tales of hardship — much to the comical irritation of the latter.For anyone serious about rebuilding the opposition, though, this farcical leadership race is no joke.While Labour contorts itself into a web of wokeness, the Conservatives are quietly cementing their new blue wall in the North.Why  Because outside leftie London and a few university towns, no one cares about tick-box ersity or even the le stories of politicians.Yes, having a “powerful backstory” is usefulyou want to make self-indulgent MPs weepy in the Commons, but it won’t persuade voters that you’re capable of getting things done.And as Boris Johnson proved so decisively last month, getting things done is what counts.The Eton and Oxford-educated Prime Minister looks and sounds nothing like most of the voters in Bishop Auckland or Redcar, but he persuaded them that he was serious about pulling Britain out of a rut.That, it turned out, was enough for an -seat majority.DOMINIC CUMMINGS is spot on: What this country needs is some more nerds.Stuffing the Civil Service full of people who meet gender and ersity quotas is all very well, butyou want employees who bring a fresh perspective, you need recruits who actually think dferently.A tech-obsessed -year-old who skipped university to pursue a career in coding could teach Whitehall’s swarms of humanities graduates a thing or two. And anyone prepared to give up a social le to work for the Government would likely do a far better job than the current civil servants who knock off at pm on a Friday.Bring on the geeks.The Opposition should now take a leaf out of his book.The last election was calamitous, yes, but with  per cent of the vote, Labour is still the second-largest party in British politics.That’s a powerful base for a recoveryit picks the right leader.The challenge is finding that person. As things stand, the field isn’t inspiring.Rebecca Long-Bailey — though a box-ticking superstar — doesn’t have the demonstrable competence that voters are yearning for from Labour.And poisonous Thornberry, who once tweeted a sneering comment about a Rochester home decorated with English flags, will repel patriotic voters.Butthe party is prepared to ditch the ersity nonsense and ignore pious pundits shrieking that the new leader “must be a woman”, the picture is rosier.The unbearably smug Keir Starmer — key player in the doomed People’s Vote campaign — would go down like a ton of bricks in Leave-voting areas.But someone like Dan Jarvis, who has called for Labour to make a “clean break” with the Corbyn era, may just have what it takes.Under Corbyn, Labour proved once and for all that wokeness doesn’t win elections.With the exception of naive students and hipster Londoners, voters don’t much care whether their politicians wear flat caps, headscarves or top hats. They just want politicians who are unafraid to act.So now MPs have a choice.Either they nominate duds with tear-jerking back- stories and shore up their majority in Putney — the right-on London seat which provided the only cause for celebration last time.Or they change tack, abandon wokery, and unearth a strong, competent leader, who might be up to the mammoth task of rebuilding the broken party.It really couldn’t be simpler.PO-FACED leftie commentators must stop laying in to journalists who call Boris “Boris” .They’ve been fighting a losing battle for years. And rightly so.Given Johnson is the third most common surname in the UK, it’s practical – not chummy – to call the Prime Minister by his much rarer Christian name.But, more importantly, the fact our PM is known by his first name on the world stage should be a source of pride to Brits.After three dreary years of Theresa May, Boris’s gravitas and quirky iniduality could hardly be more refreshing.It’s time to embrace it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Our coalition, the foundation of our party, is broken.   “This crisis has been a long time coming and we’ve kept avoiding it. It is the biggest challenge in our history.” Ms Rayner will go on to say that the next five years will be “the fight of our lives” but one that the entire Labour movement must tackle head on. She will say: “The quick fix of a new leader will not be enough.We must rethink and renew our purpose and how we convince the people to share it.Either we face up to these new times or we become irrelevant.The next five years will be the fight of our lives and I’m standing here today because I don’t run away from a fight.” The Shadow Education Secretary was expected to go for the top job but stood aside to help Rebecca Long-Bailey -  her close friend and flatmate.The deputy leader post has been vacant since before the general election , when Tom Watson announced he was quitting Parliament.Ms Rayner, who is widely considered the frontrunner, is expecting to be challenged by Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon and shadow sports minister Rosena Allin-Khan.The deputy leadership race has so far been overshadowed by the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn who announced he was standing down  in the wake of Labouraposs crushing defeat, when the party won just  seats - its worst election performance in more than  years.He will stay on in the post until the end of March, while a new leader and deputy and are chosen.

We are leaving. We will have left the EU.” The shadow Brexit Secretary said that Labour’s election defeat “blew away” the argument for a second referendum and that the debate would now move on to Britain’s future relationship with Brussels.  As he confirmed he was entering the race to replace Jeremy Corbyn, he said: “We need to focus on what comes next. Picking over the last manesto is not the job in hand. The job in hand is to write and start writing that  manesto.” Labour’s ruling National Executive Committee will meet in London on Monday to set the timetable for the contest, which is expected to formally start on Tuesday. The NEC will also set the deadline for those signing up to vote in the contest as well as the cost of becoming a registered supporter - non-party members who can vote in the race. Five candidates have already announced their leadership bids - Mr Starmer, Jess Phillips, Lisa Nandy, Emily Thornberry and Clive Lewis.  Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey, seen as the continuity Corbyn candidate, is expected to confirm she is running later this week. She will stand for leader on a joint ticket with her close friend Angela Rayner as deputy, with the flatmates understood to be sharing a policy .     Ms Rayner, the favourite to take over from Tom Watson as deputy, will launch her campaign on Monday on the council estate in Stockport where she grew up.  The new leader is expected to be in place by the end of March. Ms Phillips opened up a Brexit ide with Mr Starmer, who a poll of members suggested was the early favourite, suggesting she was prepared to push to rejoin the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"labour calls democratic reform news","story":"NewsLabour calls for democratic reform of news broadcasters over bias claimsEXCLUSIVE Labours Andy McDonald said broadcasters dubbing the race the Brexit Election played into Boris Johnsons campaign strategy - and \"biased\" media coverage \"undermines our democratic process.\"ShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsAndy McDonald says media coverage played a part in Labours defeat \" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - politicsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Mr McDonald claimed: “It was a political choice for broadcasters to use ‘the Brexit election’ rather than, say, ‘the NHS election’, and it gave the Tories a clear advantage over Labour.” The Tories have also attacked the media with Mr Johnson refusing to appear on leadersapos debates on Sky and Channel  during the election campaign, ministers boycotting BBC Radio aposs Today programme and the Mirror being banned from the Tory election bus. This week newspaper bosses hit out a Downing Street for trying to seize control of crucial daily press briefings.  The briefings, usually held in the House of Commons, where journalists are based, will be moved to Number  Downing Street - where the Government have more control on which journalists can attend. Jeremy Corbyn has previously called for a broad discussion on democratisation of the media.Among his suggestions, outlined in a  speech, were the election of some BBC board members by staff and licence fee payers, and the reduction or removal of the government’s powers of appointment. And he suggested placing the BBC on a permanent statutory footing to end government control through charter renewal.

They have destroyed and demonised Labour leaders from time immemorial. But they pulled out all the stops with Jeremy, turning a kind, principled man who cares passionately about ending inequality and injustice, into the devil incarnate. I’ve never seen an inidual so vilied and, given this, it’s astonishing that more people actually voted for Jeremy, both in this election and in , than Ed Miliband in , Gordon Brown in , or Tony Blair in . But while the Tory-backing press barons aren’t new, what’s changed in this election is the way TV and radio have joined in with that battle. On Radio , I argued that the BBC did not conduct themselves in an impartial manner during this election but I failed to mention the other broadcasters, who are equally guilty. The morning after the election, one of my Shadow Cabinet colleagues, Dan Carden, was accused by a Sky News anchor of “blaming Brexit” for Labour’s defeat. Dan laughed and pointed to the coffee table they were sitting at, which had “the Brexit election” stamped on it in huge letters. For six weeks the broadcasters dubbed this “the Brexit election”, consciously playing into Boris Johnson’s core campaign message that this election was about Brexit and that only he could “get Brexit done”. Then, after the results, the very same broadcast journalists claimed the election wasn’t about Brexit. You couldn’t make it up.The reality is, on TV Brexit was reported on twice as much as the economy and they covered the NHS even less. And on other crucial issues from climate change, education and public services, to my area, transport, there was a fraction of the airtime , despite these issues affecting the vast majority of people in our country as well as, you know, the future of our planet and all humankind.It was a political choice for broadcasters to use ‘the Brexit election’ rather than, say, ‘the NHS election’, and it gave the Tories a clear advantage over Labour. There were countless other examples of bias from broadcasters. Remember the moment when the Conservatives’ spokesperson told the press he had been punched by a pro-Labour activist  Broadcast journalists reported it without bothering to check with Labour, and were forced to delete their tweets and apologise when the footage emerged proving it was a Tory lie to distract from Boris Johnson’s refusal to look at an image of a sick child on a hospital floor. On polling day one TV journalist predicted that Johnson would win the majority “he so deserves”, and another said that postal votes were looking “grim” for Labour ten hours before the close of polls, which the Electoral Commission has warned may be a breach of the law. They painted the Tories as the ones to be taken seriously, and Labour as flighty and unreliable, even though Labour’s comprehensive and detailed plans are fully costed, while the Tories’ manesto presented no solutions to the deep social, economic and environmental problems facing our country.  According to one broadcast journalist, while the Conservatives proposed a “shopping list of promises”, Labour’s plans were merely “an encyclopedia of ambitions”. Such distortions in favour of the Conservatives included the BBC replacing footage of Johnson laying his wreath upside down on Remembrance Sunday with old footage of him correctly laying a wreath a previous year. If Jeremy had done this it would have been headline news, not airbrushed out of history. The newspapersapos agenda largely drives that of the broadcasters. These news values are outdated when most people donapost get their news from print papers, and, more signicantly, this overwhelmingly privileges the interests of billionaires and the Conservative Party they support. So is it any wonder that whatever ridiculous attack the Sun was peddling on Jeremy or the Labour Party on a particular day it was reported prominently on TV and radio, whereas revelations about Boris Johnson’s previously unreported sexist, homophobic, racist, Islamophobic, antisemitic comments and his attacks on single mothers and working class people, were generally deemed insufficiently newsworthy.  Panels and paper reviews were also largely full of anti-socialist pundits, when there are plenty who offer an alternative view. The Muslim Council of Britain also formally complained about the lack of coverage of Islamophobia in the Conservative Party, which was played down by broadcast correspondents as merely involving “some instances”, despite polling showing the majority of Conservative members hold Islamophobic views. One broadcast journalist even said antisemitism in Labour is “of a dferent order” to Islamophobia in the Conservatives, suggesting that the former is more signicant than the latter. Both are despicable and both should be scrutinised and fought across the political spectrum and across our society. Analysis shows that push notications sent out by the press were overwhelmingly anti-Labour, and softer on the Tories.This isn’t just the case for the newspaper’s apps, but for BBC and Sky’s too.And when a former Labour MP and Conservative government appointee , who probably over % of the country have never heard of was the th most prominent figure in media coverage during the election, you know the world has gone topsy turvy.While his attacks on Jeremy and Labour received copious airtime, John Major and Michael Heseltine, former Tory Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, who criticised their party, were covered far less.

A study of , UK adults, whoaposve holidayed in the last year, found they spend  hours over a seven-day holiday - the equivalent of am until :pm - wasting time. The average holiday-goer spends nearly an hour a day venturing between their accommodation and sights,  minutes choosing what to do and researching places to eat, and nearly a quarter of an hour worrying about work. However, they still manage to squeeze in a -minute nap, nearly an hour and  minutes is dedicated to activities and sightseeing, and just over an hour a day is spent properly relaxing.  you donapost plan ahead, you might find yourself wasting your time away and not truly enjoying your break  Graham Donoghue, chief executive of Sykes Holiday Cottages, which commissioned the study, said: Thereaposs now so much choice when it comes to accommodation and activities that,you donapost plan ahead, you might find yourself wasting your time away and not truly enjoying your break. A little time spent researching restaurants in advance and deciding what to do can make a big dference to your holiday. Itaposs really worth it when you think about how easy it is to find recommendations and make bookings online. The study also found that, despite spending more than an hour a day going for walks,  per cent of travellers would like to enjoy more of this during a break away. And regardless of a similar amount of time spent eating out, two-fths would like to devote more of their vacation hours indulging in delicious restaurant dishes.  A quarter of holidaymakers think they squander too much time deciding what to do, and the same amount reckon they spend more time doing what others want - than what theyaposd prefer themselves. As a result,  per cent have argued with people theyaposve holidayed with over plans for the trip ahead. In fact, before the break has even begun, adults say they spend two and half hours planning their break, with a third thinking planning is key to having a successful holiday. However, working long hours, looking after children and getting chores done at home are among the barriers to holiday-goers being able to plan in advance. More than one in  will even expect someone  to take the reins, while nearly a fth leave things to the last minute when itaposs often too late to make any advance plans.

The plant-based Rebel Whopper, which is coming to UK restaurants on Monday, is cooked on the same grill as beefburgers making it completely unsuitable for non-meat eaters. Instead it is targeting flexitarians who want to cut down on their meat consumption, with Burger King marketing director Katie Evans describing the new menu addition as a game changer  just in time for Veganuary. This really is a game changer - we wanted our first plant-based Whopper to replicate the indulgence and flame-grilled taste of the real thing as closely as possible, and weaposre thrilled with the result, she said.Weaposre delighted to satisfy the demand for this highly-anticipated product and finally bring the Rebel to the UK.

Toni Vernelli, international head of communications and marketing at Veganuary, said: For all of the important issues that Veganuary - and most vegans - are trying to address through their food choices it makes absolutely no dference whether the plant-based patty is cooked separately or on the same grill as the meat. What does make a big dference to animals and the planet is when non-vegans choose a plant-based menu option, enjoy it and then order it again.

MasterChef host Marcus Wareing, who runs Michelin-starred restaurant Marcus, has shared his mash method in his new book Marcus Everyday. Mashed potato, a British dinner staple, are usually served as a side dish to meat or vegetables and can be made using peeled or unpeeled potatoes. Milk, butter, salt and pepper are frequently used in preparation to add flavour to the mash. But itaposs not easy to perfect. In his recipe compilation, the cook urges readers to follow three steps. “Cut evenly, cook evenly and don’t rush”, he advises. The TV chef adds that many make the mistake of cutting their potatoes to dferent sizes, the Daily Star reports. Other common errors people make are boiling them too quickly and failing to leave them to rest. Here are some of the cookaposs tips for a perfect mash... . Cut the potatoes evenly  Marcus Wareing says it is important to peel the potatoes cleanly, then wash them and make sure they are cut into evenly sized piece. This is because,they are dferent sizes, the smaller pieces will overcook and they will absorb water, which can make your mash tasteless. . Boil them slowly The potatoes need to be cooked in salted water at a slow boil. If boiled fast, the outside will be overcooked before the middle of the potato chunks is cooked through. This will create dferent consistency in your mash and make it unpleasant. . Leave them to rest  Once the potatoes are cooked, you should drain and leave them for a good five minutes. After shaking them around, you can put them back in the pan, off the heat. Once they have rested, the potatoes are ready to be mashed to your liking, adding butter, cheese or herbs. A potato ricer helps in the process of making mashed potato. Most people use Russets for mashed potatoes because of their high starch and low water content, according to Simply Recipes . Yukon Golds, which are a little more expensive than Russets, are another popular alternative as they are naturally creamy when mashed and have a slightly buttery flavour of their own. Marcus explains: “First, peel the potatoes cleanly, then wash them and cut them all into evenly sized pieces, otherwise the smaller potato pieces will overcook, and before they break they will absorb water, which will make your mash watery and tasteless.  “Boil them in salted water at a slow boil – a fast boil will overcook the outside before the middle of the potato chunks are cooked through you don’t want lumps of overcooked potato in your mash. “Once the potatoes are cooked all the way through, but not quite falling apart, drain and leave them for a good five minutes, then shake them around and put them back in the pan, off the heat. “The potatoes should then be hot enough to take the butter on board.

Soleimani, commonly thought of as the second most powerful man in Iran, was killed in Iraq in a US drone strike at a convoy at Baghdad airport on Friday. The military commander was killed alongside Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of Iran-backed militias in Iraq known as the PMF. Now a video has been shared on Twitter by Babak Taghvae, who describes himself as defence analyst, showing five coffins placed on seats of a plane - allegedly including the bodies of Soleimaniaposs and al-Muhandis. While Mr Taghvae shared the clip, which also shows two men sat in the row in front of the coffins, it isnapost clear who recorded it. He wrote with his post: A Mahan Air Airbus A carried coffins of Qasem Soleimani  Abu-Mahdi Al-Muhandis to Tehran right on the passenger seats instead of being loaded in cargo hold. Commonly bodies are shipped via cargo  planes but it appears Iranian authorities may have decided to put the men on seats as a mark of respect. It comes after Soleimaniaposs body was transported through the Iranian city of Mashhad earlier today as part of a grand funeral procession across the Islamic Republic.  Mourners crowded around military personnel in Mashad unloading Soleimaniaposs casket covered with an Iranian flag from a plane at Ahvaz International Airport in Tehran. A tide of mourners chanted furiously as his coffin was driven through tens of thousands in the streets of the southwestern city Ahvaz where funeral processions began. Live footage aired on state TV showed mourners wearing black and beating their chests as they walked through the streets. Crowds furiously chanted aposDeath to Americaapos as they paraded the slain military commander.  Iranian leaders have vowed to avenge the death of the -year-old, who was esteemed as the countryaposs second most powerful figure after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The drone strike has been widely condemned by international leaders who fear that diplomatic tensions could escalate into a war with the US. The US regarded Soleimani as a terrorist. Iranaposs Ali Khamenei warned that a harsh retaliation is waiting for the superpower "},{"url":null,"title":"toby carvery staff share eight","story":"NewsToby Carvery staff share eight things they want to tell you - but arent allowedAs with all jobs, there are a number of things Toby Carvery employees would love to tell customersonly they could.

The hard-hitting show documented the daily lives of people living in James Turner Street in Winson Green, an inner-city working class area in Birmingham - warts and all. Residents in the bustling street were seen trying to make ends meet evenmeant breaking the law by shoplting, committing benefit fraud and growing cannabis. The nation was hooked and tuned in to watch the ins and outs of people living in the Victorian terraced houses including Deidre Kelly , Samora Roberts , Smoggy , James Clarkeand Lee Nutley.Six years on and the street is a a quieter place with new families residing in the properties which were once home to those who stared in the documentary, Birmingham Live reports.However, the street still has its issues with litter scattered across the pavements, fly-tipping and homes plighted with mice infestations. One mum-of-two was moved to James Turner Street by Birmingham Council after she was deemed homeless and in need of temporary accommodation. She said: I said I didnapost care where I lived, I just wanted a roof over my head, until I came here. Every time I step out my door, thereaposs litter everywhere. Iaposve only been here since July, Iaposm trying to get out.  I was homeless and living in a Travelodge. At least it was nice and clean in there. We had a mice infestation here, but we got a cat so thataposs sorted it.  Many of the residents are in a similar situation and said they had been moved to the street by housing associations or the council. A dad-of-five said his family were moved to the road from Richmond, south west London, because he couldnapost afford the capitalaposs prices. The move meant leaving family members behind, but he has made new friends on the street - which he says still retains its community feel, despite its problems.  He said: I was terried at first, all Iaposd ever heard about Birmingham is itaposs a s*** hole, donapost go there.  Iaposve been through so much. Iaposm just happy to have a roof over my head, evenitaposs a s*** one. But the people are nice. The other night they all come out, everyone was out watching the fireworks. Itaposs a nice community, itaposs not like London,you dropped on the floor, theyaposd walk past you, here theyaposd stop and help. Everyone says hello, youaposve got the odd couple, but it is nice. I do like the people. He has lived in the street for three years and has noted a number of disturbing incidents, including a-year-old girl forced to move with her family after being sexually harassed, a delivery driver being carjacked and a family unable to wash their  kids for more than a year.  I wish Iaposd come here [Birmingham] earlier, just not this street, he said. Iaposve seen a gentleman get out of his car bringing a food delivery, and as he got out, one of these lads jumped in it and drove off. He also said one family who lived across the street survived with no running water and no electricity for a year-and-a-half. The people, they donapost deserve to live in the s*** theyaposre living in. Because they are living in filth, he said.  There was a family up the end there, there was a lot of them. The landlord done f*** all. Not a f***** thing. They must have had  kids and they never had a wash as long as they were here. You would see and smell them walk past, it would break my heart. Some of these people, I can see in their face they are just depressed. Some of the people are the closest to animals I have ever seen people be. One -year-old girl, the boys would not leave her alone. In the end the police had to get involved, they had to move them.  Speaking about illegal dumping on his street, he said: It seems like itaposs just left, once it gets in a mess, they leave it a mess. You canapost leave nothing out,I left my buggy there, went in for half an hour, Iaposd come back and guarantee itaposs gone. His partner added: Theyaposd rob the eyes out of your f***** head. Basoz Ali moved into the street with her family after their landlord in Perry Barr asked for their property back.  The young family, who have two children, are living in temporary accommodation with the council. The -year-old said: Itaposs so dficult, we feel like weaposre ignored. We feel neglected.

The billionaire paedophileaposs death was officially ruled as suicide by hanging at Manhattan politan Correctional Center, despite speculation and conspiracy theories he was murdered. The graphic photos show the deep bloodied cut to the -year-oldaposs neck and the severed neck bone, as well as strips of orange sheet fashioned into nooses, with one looped through a bed post inside his cell. Obtained by  Minutes and broadcast for the first time in America on Sunday, the images were captured last August with Epstein having taken his own le while awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges. They also show other bed sheets strewn across the floor, fragments of material dangling from a window, his body on a trolley and a handwritten note complaining about conditions.  Almost three months on from the disgraced financieraposs death, Dr Michael Baden, who was hired by the paedophileaposs brother, Mark, to observe the post-mortem, suggested Epstein could have been strangled by someone in his cell.  In an interview with Fox News, Dr Baden - a former coroner in New York - rejected the official findings and claimed Epsteinaposs body bore telltale signs of homicide. The -year-old said Epstein had two fractures on the left and right sides of his larynx, specically the Adam’s apple, and a broken left hyoid bone above the Adam’s apple. Dr Baden, who has probed cases involving OJ Simpson, President John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jnr, said: “I think that the evidence points toward homicide rather than suicide.  “Those three fractures are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation. In his -year career he has not seen a suicidal hanging case where those injuries have occurred, he said, adding: “Hanging does not cause these broken bones. Homicide does.” There were also haemorrhages in Epstein’s eyes that were common in homicidal strangulation and uncommon in suicidal hangings, he added.  Dr Baden, a Fox News contributor, claimed there were signs of “unusual” activity “from day one” of the autopsy. New Yorkaposs medical examiner has not yet responded to his claims. He called for a fresh investigation into Epsteinaposs death, saying a number of people would have to be involvedit was a homicide. Evidence on the ligature could help to prove whether someone was involved in Epsteinaposs death.  The expert also cited a “total breakdown in security” around Epsteinaposs cell and rejected claims that the guards had fallen asleep as two CCTV cameras maled. Dr Baden said his own investigation is not complete. He has examined more than , bodies during his career and hosted the HBO programme Autopsy.  Just weeks before his death, Epstein was found on the floor of his cell with marks around his neck in what was thought to be a possible suicide attempt at the time. He was put on suicide watch but removed a week later. He was not sharing a cell with another prisoner at the time of his death. The guards responsible for keeping an eye on Epstein the night he killed himself have been charged with falsying records and conspiracy.

They have these massive eyes, bunched up noses - the condition is called brachycephalism. We have, through human selection, bred them to look more like a human baby because we find that cute, but unfortunately that cute look is not very good for the animal.

The -year-old snapper said: Long-tailed macaques are the most commonly found monkey for sale in Indonesiaaposs markets. They are cute looking and easily attainable in the wild relatively close to cities. The demand is mixed. Some people buy the monkeys as babies, thinking they will stay cute forever, only to find them turn aggressive once they hit adulthood. Others buy them to train as dancing monkeys. The animals are being sold for as little as and largely live in misery. These monkeys are often tortured to learn to stand on their feet like humans, being hung just so their toes touch the ground for hours, beaten and starved so that they ride a bicycle or stilts on demand. Once trained they are paraded at traffic lights and busy areas, where their owners ask for money after each performance, Mr Massey added. He added: Youngsters are left in small cages or chained up once they reach adulthood. Some lucky monkeys are bought by well-meaning tourists to be released or given to organisations but, despite being well meaning, this usually just fuels the trade. Seeing a monkey in the wild is a fantastic experience. Seeing them in captivity in the markets is a horrible feeling, seeing their sadness in their eyes, while feeling completely helpless as theyaposre chained up is awful. Also knowing they are group animals and they are often kept on their own.

General Soleimani, head of Iranaposs elite Quds Force, was seen smiling as he embraced Hezbollahaposs Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah during a meeting in Beirut. The military chief is also seen praying in the images - understood to have been taken last week - which were released by Iranian media on Sunday. Secretary-General Nasrallah has vowed to avenge his friendaposs death, saying US forces would pay the price for the drone strike that killed General Soleimani near Baghdadaposs airport last Friday. He said in a televised speech: The American army killed them and it will pay the price. The only just punishment isAmerican military presence in the region: US military bases, US warships, each and every officer and soldier in the region. He said US civilians, including businessmen, engineers, journalists and doctors, should be spared.  He added: When the coffins of American soldiers and officers... start toto the United States,Trump and his administration will realise they have lost the region. The Hezbollah leader also called on Iraq to free itself of the American occupation. Hezbollah has been deemed a terrorist organisation by the US, UK and the Arab League.  General Soleimani was killed in a strike on his convoy after landing at Baghdadaposs airport, sending the Iran-US conflict into unprecedented territory amid a spiralling crisis. Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was also killed. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, meanwhile, has finally broken his silence on the strike and the growing crisis in the Middle East following his Caribbean holiday.  The PM had faced criticism over his silence and his refusal to cut short his trip to Mustique. In a statement released on Sunday evening, Mr Johnson did not condemn Mr Trumpaposs actions, saying: Today I have spoken with President Macron, President Trump and Chancellor Merkel, and will be speaking with other leaders in the coming days. General Qassem Soleimani posed a threat to all our interests and was responsible for a pattern of disruptive, destabilising behaviour in the region. Given the leading role he has played in actions that have led to the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians and western personnel, we will not lament his death.  It is clear however that all calls for retaliation or reprisals will simply lead to more violence in the region and they are in no-oneaposs interest.

In the clip, she sports a iety of dferent coloured wigs and skin tones, from light to dark. But some have taken offence at this, suggesting Ghadeer has shown disrespect to cultures.This is the most offensive thing I’ve seen. You can portray togetherness without disrespecting an entire culture. So uneducated, this is beyond unnecessary and unacceptable, wrote one Instagram user.This is just a straight up black face, which is very offensive and as an educated makeup artist you should know better about that, you want to show your abilities or talent on black skin USE A BLACK MODEL !!! Period, another added. Others have urged the beauty influencer to delete the post. PLEASE DELETE THIS. Darkening your face, regardless of the context or the circumstances, is always unacceptable because of the racist history of blackface, reads a comment.  But Ghadeer, from Kuwait, defended herself online. She wrote: I am not racist.. I hate racism. What I’ve done is only to show what I am capable of… I love you all.

That was a dficult time.“We’ve had loads of ups and downs but the past year is certainly one, for the first half of it anyway, we want to put behind us as quickly as possible.“With the recent bit of form and positivity, we take that into  and kick on.”Dundee start the year with three home matches on the bounce, firstly against potential play-off rivals Caley Thistle and Ayr United before they welcome high-flying Premiership side Motherwell to Dens Park for a Scottish Cup tie.“We have dficult games coming up.

That’s not being arrogant or cocky but what Dundee should be aiming for.“There needs to be a realisation of how good this squad can be.”And Kerr says the second half against league leaders United last Friday gives everyone associated with the club belief they can start looking upwards.“There was a wee realisation after the game we could have taken three points.“The boys have spoken since and we’re starting to realise how well we can do as a team.“After we got the goal at Tannadice, there was a belief on the pitch and I think the fans felt that.“Even when the board went up for how long was left, the fans still thought we could win it.“Hopefully, that is a wee turning point for us – it needs to be going forward.“There has been a lot of disappointment, a lot of games where we have huffed and puffed throughout the season.“Last Friday, the fans came again in their numbers and I didn’t expect there to be so many, to be honest.“United had three of the stands but our fans were so loud again and when we scored it was great to go and celebrate with them.“Our fans have had to endure a dficult year, especially with United being on top since day one.“We are happy with how it went but, at the same time, we need to make sure we don’t rest on a draw – we need to remember we didn’t win – but use it to kick us on.”Dundee have faced the Caley Jags three times this season, winning -, drawing - and losing - last time in Inverness.Dundee United - Dundee: Dorrans# first goal earns Dee derby point\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united---dundee-dorrans-first-goal-earns-dee-derby-point embed # secretynOUlpvmC\" data-secret\"ynOUlpvmC\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Kerr added: “We are under no illusions how tough it will be tomorrow.

win for his side and the second a late leveller at Tannadice.He may only have made  appearances for the club before injury ended his career early but McPake’s leadership on the pitch earns him a place in this team.Andrew RobertsonVery little has to be said about this choice – Robertson was a star in the making at Tannadice.Arriving as an unknown -year-old from Queen’s Park, Robertson swtly made the left-back place his own and became well-known for rampaging runs down the flank.Just a year later, he was off to Hull City for £. million and has since become a European Cup winner with Liverpool and Scotland captain.His  games for United brought five goals.Midfielders:Gary Mackay-StevenThe wing wizard edged out Dundee favourite Gary Harkins for the right-wing berth in our team.‘GMS’ was an entertainer with an array of tricks and flicks and was a major part of the free-flowing football that made the Tangerines a regular top-six outfit under Jackie McNamara.Stuart ArmstrongArmstrong and ‘GMS’ were inseparable at the top end of Scottish football for years before the former moved down south to Southampton.Armstrong’s athleticism and ability on the ball made him the focal point of United’s attack during six years at the club from  to .Kevin ThomsonHe may only have played  times for the Dens Park club.However, Thomson’s ability and nous in the middle of the park played a huge role in Dundee’s top-six finish in -.Craig ConwayA man scoring two goals in a Scottish Cup Final win is a must for a team like this.A compact, tricky attacker, Conway went on to enjoy a fine career for himself down south after making his name at Tannadice.Strikers: Greg StewartPlucked from Cowdenbeath, Stewart was arguably Dundee’s Player of the Decade.Shortlisted for the -

draw at Tannadice showed exactly why Dundee United are where they are.The Dark Blues probably were the better team in the end and they’ll take plenty of positives out of it but it was a good result for the Tangerines, too.I agree with manager Robbie Neilson saying his side didn’t play as well as they could have.For some reason, they looked a bit anxious and nervy in the second half which is completely unlike them.United had done so well in the previous derbies and been so assured it was a surprise to see them just lump the ball forward as the game wore on.However, the sign of a title-winning team is they can still take a point despite not playing well against one of the better sides in the ision.And they even extended their lead at the top as, once more, the other sides failed to take advantage of United dropping points.For James and his side, they were far better than previous derby showings, that much is obvious.It was a step forward for them and will give their fans a positive jolt heading into the new year.I still think they have problems creating chances.They had lots of good play in the second half but still can’t convert that into clear-cut opportunities.Look at the stats and, though Dundee about edged the game for me, United still had more shots on goal.I do think the way the Dens gaffer has set up his team recently suits them better and that showed on Friday night.There’s more balance in the midfield with Fin Robertson and Graham Dorrans taking turns to control things in the middle.It’s taken a while, which is understandable given the big changes in the summer, but James is starting to find a good formation and his best starting XI.These things always take time but it seems like the Dee are getting there.The key is they kick on from here.For United, it’s about ticking over and keeping themselves well clear of any trouble at the top.Sounds like there were a fair few interested parties at the derby, no doubt taking a look at Lawrence Shankland after his goalscoring exploits this season.It wouldn’t surprise methose English clubs were keeping an eye on Robertson and Dorrans either, the way those two are performing."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united right to call out racism","story":"Watching the derby on TV there were a few times I thought things might spill over from the stands.I wasn’t expecting any alleged racism to come out from the any part of the support, however, as appears to be the case from a video that has emerged.I think Dundee United have handled it in the right way, calling it out strongly.There’s no place for any sort of racism at football – or anywhere  for that matter."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e0dc754df9892.73393200.jpg ","title":"things starting to click for dee says skip josh","story":"Josh Meekings says things are starting to click for Dundee as they head into the new year but knows better than most how tough a task they face this weekend.The Dens Park skipper reckons the second-half performance at Tannadice last Friday night showed the Dark Blues have learned lessons from the first half of the campaign.And he plans, along with his team-mates, to continue to put those lessons into practice against Inverness at Dens on Saturday.The central defender, who lted the Scottish Cup as Caley Thistle captain in , said: “Saturday is another tough one against Inverness at home.“We know what Inverness are like. They have been very good this season, picking up points and had been on a little run up until last Saturday.“I keep repeating myself to everybody but it is only about us and what we do because we can’t affect anybody ’s results, we need to keep plugging away ourselves like we have been doing.“Last Friday was a bit more positive compared with the previous two derbies – I think we learned from those games.“As a group we are all learning together and getting better. I think that is starting to show on the pitch.“Looking back over the past few weeks, at the time you want three points at Arbroath but, in hindsight, it was a decent point in hard conditions.“They are no mugs and showed that at the weekend again.“We went into Dunfermline and Partick and picked up two positive results but we are taking it a game at a time, maintaining our focus and working hard.“That’s all we can do, trust the management and then trust what we can do on the pitch.“We had so many bodies coming in during the summer, a massive turnover and that always takes a little while.“The manager has changed things, formations, tactics, and I do feel we are starting to click a bit better.“It’s only positive right now for us and we need to keep our head down. We can only do our job and not bother about other teams in the league.”Skipper Meekings and his team-mates took a lot out of the - draw at leaders Dundee United, particularly after going behind so early.“We showed a lot of character and dug in last Friday,” he added.“We’d been behind before in derbies and obviously suffered after that but this time we showed a bit of character and got back into it in the second half.“I think the last  minutes we gave it our all but couldn’t quite get that second goal.“It’s a good point on the road after a good period where we have picked up some points.“We had a sticky period and we’ve got out of it.“It was dficult at Tannadice the previous time so it is a bit more positive.”The -year-old, however, admits he feared the Dark Blues could have been in for another long night at Tannadice after Nicky Clark nipped in front of him to score after five minutes.A few choice words at half-time, though, brought out much better from Dundee in the second period.“When you are a centre-half and an early goal goes in against you, you think ‘we’ve got it all to do now’.“The boys dug deep, we all got stuck in – there was a bit said at half-time between the players and we needed that.“Moving forward, we need that drive and energy because it is a long season still – we are only halfway done and there is plenty to play for.”Meekings was also pleased to be able to give the club’s fans a cheerier festive period after a pretty gloomy .He added: “Hopefully, we gave our fans a decent Christmas and they could enjoy the New Year a bit more.“We would have loved to have given them three points but I think we showed passion and did everything we could last Friday.“We couldn’t quite get that second goal but it is a positive result.“If you show energy and passion like that, the fans will respond.“We wanted the three points but the derby was a positive point and the fans kept backing us.“We’ll keep fighting for them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-fell-love-marlene","story":"MAGNETIC, marvellous Marlene Dietrich made the front page of the Evening Times - of course - when she came to Glasgow on November , ."},{"url":null,"title":"greatest-gift-glasgow---burrell-collection-marks-75-years","story":"WHEN Sir William Burrell gave his collection to Glasgow  years ago it was described as ldquoone of the greatest gts ever made to any city in the world."},{"url":null,"title":"back-day-glasgows-first-boom---12th-century","story":"THIS week we travel back to the late th and early th century to see how Glasgow went from a small settlement of Christians to a growing presence in Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"dedicated-fans-britain-away-day-glasgow-clan","story":"For years, it has been seen as a badge of honour amongst sports fans, especially football fans in Scotland, with away attendances seen as a source of pride or embarrassment."},{"url":null,"title":"five-fitness-alternatives-joining-gym-glasgow-new-year","story":"ON TUESDAY evening, millions of people across the world celebrated the end of a decade and the beginning of a new one."},{"url":null,"title":"food-rationing-glasgow---80th-anniversary","story":"JANUARY is traditionally a lean month. as families recover from the excesses of the festive season by choosing to diet, drink less and live more economically."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-science-centre-ai-can-us","story":"ARTIFICIAL Intelligence is a modern phrase that often instils fear in the hearts of the general public.

The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in . At the time, the club#s office was aboard her.Closer to home, Ardrishaig man Billy Paterson called into the Advertiser offices to say his father, Ardrishaig Primary School headmaster Gilbert Paterson, had crewed the yacht Fulmar.Mr Paterson still has mementoes from his father#s trips in the form of gts from Commander Mowat, including a paperweight from , a copper and brass barrel ashtray dated  and a brass model yacht with #Fulmar # engraved on it.Thanks to everyone who contacted the Advertiser with their memories.We now know a little more about Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , owner of the Fulmar.Details about the crew of #Tanky#, #Bosun# and #Pilot# remain, however, sketchy, soanyone out there knows any more#"},{"url":null,"title":"my new year resolution is","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards"},{"url":null,"title":"plenty of christmas room at the inn","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens committee hosted its annual Christmas lunch in the Inveraray Inn.The event, on Sunday December  for senior citizens of Inveraray, was well attended with everyone enjoying a delicious meal and musical entertainment provided by Lochgilphead#s Easy Club.During the festivities, the committee presented flowers to Diane MacDonald, who is retiring from the committee after nine years."},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

Caroline and Duncan were parents to Calum, who sadly passed away aged  after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.Knowing he and his family lived in a beautul part of the world, Calum wanted children suffering from cancer to come to Bute for special getaways where the entire family could cherish quality time together and recharge their batteries for what may lie ahead.The charity now runs several holiday homes on Bute and private flats in Glasgow for families travelling to the city for treatments at the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Care and Royal Hospital for Children.Dumfries House Lodge is a -room, five-star country guest house with two self-catering cottages, all staffed round the clock.Eight families have been referred through the children#s charity so far to enjoy a four-night stay free of charge.Caroline said: #To allow Calum#s Cabin families to be helped in such a special way is an absolute honour. For many of the families who have had this opportunity, their conditions would have been too severe to get away on holiday, or to come to Bute, so Dumfries House is perfect. Sadly for some, it has been their final holiday together.#The families have been blown away by their stays at Dumfries House.

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users to ensure the wellbeing and successful future of the eagles in the south of Scotland and to secure its place for the future.Those who have participated in the initiative, ranging from four-years-old up to , come from a range of backgrounds and organisations, including the UKrsquos first ever Golden Eagle Scout Champions at the Scottish Borders Scouts, over  pupils from primary schools across the south of Scotland and one in the Scottish Highlands, Borders College, the Scottish Raptor Study Group, Kielder Bird of Prey Centre, HMP Dumfries, and local businesses like Wild Tree Adventures.Earlier this year, the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk also announced that it plans to open a Golden Eagle Centre which will support the projectrsquos conservation and community engagement work.Francesca Osowska, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos chief executive, said: ldquoThis is a fantastic milestone.\"Golden eagles are such an amazing part of Scotlandrsquos bioersity, and an integral part of building a nature-rich country for us all.\"Wersquore passionate about ing golden eagles to places where they used to be plentul ndash and it looks like we have thousands of people on our side!\"A huge thank you to all the wonderful volunteers and project participants.The first four birds which were moved to the area have settled into their new habitats and are now fending for themselves.Support from volunteers and participants plays a pivotal role in helping the iconic species continue to grow and thrive in the area.One volunteer was shortlisted as Student of the Year by the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who farmed commercially yet with great respect for wildle, I was very excited by the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos aims.\"I badgered the project team to let me volunteer and have since been helping at public engagement events, which I thoroughly enjoy.As well as colleges, the outreach team have also visited many schools across the Borders.Michelle Hoppeacute, principal teacher for Yarrow  Kirkhope Primary Schools, said: ldquoWe were really excited to be one of the first schools to take part in the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos Eagle Schools initiative.\"It really brought our community together and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.\"The children have had the most amazing experience.\"We are incredibly proud of the interest our pupils have shown in protecting this majestic and important bird. We look forward to supporting the project to make sure that Golden Eagles flourish in the south of Scotland.Project partners include RSPB Scotland, Scottish Land  Estates, Scottish Forestry, Scottish Natural Heritage, and the Southern Uplands Partnership.Funded by The National Lottery Heritage Fund, project partners, Scottish Power Renewables, the Scottish Government and local LEADER Programmes, the initiative is a key project under the Scottish Governmentrsquos  Challenge for Scottish Bioersity."},{"url":null,"title":"melrose-sevens-bosses-make-u-turn-road-closure","story":"BOSSES at Melrose Rugby have made a U-turn on their plans to close off St Marys Road during next years sevens.As previously reported, the stretch was due to be shut for two weeks ndash to allow for a temporary stand to be erected.But following discussions with the towns community council, chiefs running the four-day tournament have changed their minds.Now St Marys road will only be partially closed on game days, with a traffic light system in place.Philip Morris, sevens tournament director at Melrose Rugby, said: ldquoAn event like this one will of course come with an element of disruption to the usual routine.\"The Melrose community has embraced the sevens every year, however, concerns around an expanded event are of course completely understandable.\"For the avoidance of doubt, wersquore working really hard to support local businesses as suppliers to the event.\"And wersquoll also be consulting with local residents to address any specic concerns they have too.\"We are confident the economic boost to Melrose and the surrounding Borders towns during the expanded sevens event will be huge.\"News of the U-turn has been welcomed by members of Melrose Community Council.Chairman William Windram said: \"I still think the plans are a bit fluid at the moment, and I think there is still a lot of work going on behind the scenes.\"There are, however, still some issues like late night noise that have not been considered yet, but we have asked them [the club] to come back to our meeting in February to give us an update.\"Some amelioration has certainly taken place and we should be pleased.\"One of the concerns raised by Melrose Community Council at its November meeting was the impact the tournament would have on churchgoers ndash with the event taking place over the Easter weekend.In response, Mr Morris said: \"We are working hard to ensure the important Easter Sunday church service is not impacted and people will be able to get to and from the church without signicant disruption.\"Now the traffic situation on St Marys Road is becoming clearer, we have a plan that we feel will satisfy our local residents.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the

had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

An adult female acted as a sentry. Scanning the nearby mountain ridge for danger she was possibly distracted by her offspring, barely two months old, grazing with the herd. By the time she spotted the puma it was too late.Exploding from her hiding place the cat raced towards its prey gathering up the distance at an astonishing rate. The guanacos sprinted for their lives. When they cut right to avoid running over a clf the puma also altered course running past us aswe were invisible.A chulengostumbled. Although he got to his feet his misfortune meant he had become the principal target. A few seconds later the puma had closed the gap and sunk its retractable claws into the chulengorsquos hind quarters bringing him down. In nature some perish so others live. The chulengo would provide food for a week.Witnessing a successful hunt is such a rare event that my guide, Rex Bryngelson, an American with  years of Andes Mountains guiding experience, had only seen it once before. While the puma dragged off her prey behind some tall grass we checked our images and high-fived.Pumas are native to the mountains of both North and South America but Patagonia is reputed to be the best place to see them. The rocky surface and relative absence of people provide them with a suitable habitat to live even though, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, their numbers are in decline.I had found Rex through an advertisement in a photography magazine and he had taken care of all the arrangements including accommodation, ground transportation and most signicantly acquiring the services of Roberto Donas, an expert tracker.Roberto had driven us five hours from Punta Arenas, the southernmost city in Chile, to Estancia Laguna Amarga, a ranch catering to hikers, outdoor enthusiasts and photographers. Many of the private ranches in Patagonia participate in nature conservation. We slept in bunk beds, shared the toilets and showers and ate in a dining room which looked out at the famous towers: Torres Del Paine. Rex described it as rustic but it was more than adequate.December is summer in the southern hemisphere so the sun rose at am and gave us  hours of daylight. Each morning around .am we silently loaded our gear into Robertorsquos Mitsubishi SUV before setting off for five or six hours of puma tracking. Roberto made us coffee once we stopped and that jolted us alive. We also ate sandwiches prepared by the Estancia staff. Then it was back to the hunt for Patagoniarsquos apex predator.We ed to the ranch late morning when the pumas normally enjoy a siesta to take a brief nap ourselves. I also used the quiet time to edit photos, recharge camera batteries and make notes. The staff prepared a hot lunch before we headed out for a second photography session in the late afternoon.Of the nine sessions we experienced puma sightings during eight of them which became a source of amusement. Rex, I suppose, had been hedging his bets when, in his sales pitch, hersquod emailed me to say, ldquoWe are almost guaranteed to see pumas.From the first day onwards we were in position to get images any of which would have satisfied me before the trip. Roberto it must be said deserves the credit for our success. He has been a professional tracker for ten years and has earned the respect of his peers. ldquoI call him the Professor, one told me. ldquoHe is a satellite of information. His services are sought out by such esteemed media as National Geographic and BBC Planet Earth.Using high-powered binoculars he would search the nearby mountains looking for signs of pumas. The guanacos offered clues. If he saw them staring in one direction for an extended period of time he would look for the object of their focus. The top of the head or the flick of a tail confirmed the location of a puma. His perception was staggering. But I lost count of the number of times he pointed to a cat and said, ldquoThere, do you see it  My response was typically ldquoNo, where Two other trackers were also out in the hills. The trio communicated by VHF radio to give each otherrsquos clients the best opportunity to see the pumas. After all, the more success the better for business.ldquoIf nature is safe we will have jobs forever, Roberto explained.Each day we rotated the locations so as not to stress the pumas repeatedly. Some cats they described as shy while others were more tolerant of humans. And, when Jorge who has been compiling a catalogue of pumas in the area ndash and giving them names ndash realised we had spooked a mother and cub sitting on a hill one hundred metres away, he abruptly ended the session and we ed to our vehicles.One morning as we drove across the bumpy terrain Roberto announced we were going to look for a mother with four cubs. A normal litter is two or three. Again we hiked uphill for quite a distance and approached the location. We were in luck. The mother was lying down while her cubs played next to her.Roberto signalled for us to remain in a spot  metres away. All five pumas looked at us but since we kept our distance they relaxed. Hours passed. We watched the cubs playing while their mother slept. Then Jorge, who had wandered away from us reported on the radio, ldquoHermanita is coming! The approach of this enormous female puma caused panic among the cubs and they ran uphill away from their mother.Everyone lost sight of Hermanita until suddenly her head appeared above the mountaintop. This frightened the cubs again and they ran downhill past their mother and towards us. Because I was so focused on the impending confrontation of the two adult females I had lost track of the two cubs once they passed. Rex said, ldquoPaul, look to your left.The two cubs were sitting less than ten feet away. Remarkably, they were comfortable enough with us to seek our protection. Meanwhile, Hermanita walked around urinating and scratching the ground marking her territory. The mother rolled over on her back in a subservient position. Once Hermanita had established the hierarchy and left the scene the mother went looking for her cubs.Although it was summer the weather changed frequently. My backpack contained extra layers, a puff jacket, waterproof jacket and trousers and gloves. Many times the infamous Patagonia winds picked up and the temperature dropped substantially for a short period. At moments like these we would sit down on rocks or on the ground itself, careful to avoid the painful sting of golden barrel cactus which grows everywhere in Patagonia. The locals call it \"mother-in-law cushion. But with a view of the Torres Del Paine and other Andean monuments who could complain While the pumas were our primary objective we also encountered grey foxes, European hares and an assortment of birds native to the Andes. A few times we looked up to see Andean Condors soaring past us through the valley, their massive wingspans approaching ten feet. For the relatively short time I was in Patagonia the compilation of wildle experiences was mind blowing and I could not imagine having a better run of luck.Rex runs puma photography trips in the Autumnand spring . When he is not busy providing such wonderful opportunities he runs a fly fishing lodge . Stumbling upon his advertisement certainly paid idends."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Scottish independence won t be won or lost over finance - Brexit showed that it s not the economy","story":"Since itrsquos a new year, let me pay due respect to the prolic statistically-literate Unionist businessman, Kevin Hague. He must be the most patient man alive, almost a social media saint. Watch him calmly respond to vilication and abuse every time he points out that taxes raised in Scotland could not sustain public spending, were Scotland to become independent tomorrow.Scotland has a nominal deficit of several billions of pounds which could cause immediate fiscal belt-tighteningthe Barnett taps were turned off. I say nominal because there is much controversy over Haguersquos figures.However, he won a signicant victory last year when the Scottish Government largely accepted, in the Sustainable Growth Commission, his arguments about Scotlandrsquos fiscal position, based as they are on the GERS calculations of Government spending and revenues.Nicola Sturgeon now accepts that independence will involve short-term spending restraint. Thatrsquos better than long-term decline under Westminster rule, she says. Yoursquod think that this admission would have damaged the SNPrsquos electoral standing, but the reverse is true. Last month they enjoyed another landslide victory.So herersquos the puzzle: why have Scottish voters not punished the SNP for agreeing that independence could mean, at the very least, a period of economic dislocation and public spending cuts  The Growth Commission numbers suggest that SNP promises of more cash for the NHS and social care, a costly new benefits system, compensation for Waspi women, electrication of transport and many other spending commitments would be hard to achieve.At the very least taxes would have to rise. But Scottish voters donrsquot seem particularly worried. This is because they are bothered about something more important than deficits. Brexit shows that when it comes to issues of sovereignty and identity, it isnrsquot ldquothe economy, stupid. Rarely has a political axiom been so comprehensively disproved. It clearly isnrsquot the economy that has been driving events in the UK.Looking back over the past three turbulent years, itrsquos obvious that Remainers had the best arguments. If you regard Brexit, as Hague would, as a purely economic exercise in cost-benefit analysis, it stinks. Leaving the largest and wealthiest free trade area on the planet is almost impossible to justy on narrow economic terms.There will almost certainly be a quick and dirty free trade deal negotiated in  that will remove tarfs on goods. But % of UK trade is in non-physical services. There is bound to be an increase in non-tarf barriers to British trade with the single market which will affect UK businesses. That is why so many financial companies have already been setting up shop in Dublin to operate within the rules of the EU single market.Supply chains will be disrupted, which is why car manufacturers were so opposed to Brexit. There have been problems on the high street this Christmas with the shortage of casual labour. The departure of EU citizens is likely to damage education, agriculture manufacturing and services, especially care services.Left-wing Remainers tried to claim that in some way it was billionaires who were behind Brexit, but this was never the case. Remain was, is, a thoroughly pro-capitalist, pro-business case, vigorously pursued and financed by the largest corporate interests, from car manufacturers to banks.Gina Miller is no socialist. Nor is the governor of the Bank of England, the head of Goldman Sachs, or the bosses of Jaguar Land Rover and Honda. It was a handful of pub-chain capitalists, such as Tim Martin of Wetherspoon, who backed Brexit. They are essentially English nationalists who think that Brexit is in some way a declaration of independence.Brexit, as they saw it, was about winning freedom from unelected Brussels bureaucrats and letting Britain stand strong in the world. Irsquod say thatrsquos nonsense, of course. It was never clear that membership of the single market involved a diminution of British sovereignty, even though much trade legislation had been ceded to Brussels. But economic rationality is really not the point.Brexit was essentially an argument about democracy and nationalism. As the General Election has shown, for millions of voters the economy, finance and fiscal policy had very little to do with their political priorities. Remainers were comprehensively defeated because they appeared to do down Britain and ignored the will of the people. Brexit had won the referendum, and no amount of economic reality was going to change votersrsquo minds.The Scottish Government loathes Brexit, and for very good reasons. Scots did not vote to leave the European Union for a start. But in the longer term, Brexit is very good news for the SNP. No matter what arguments unionists such as Hague deploy in future about Scotlandrsquos deficit, it will surely not determine whether or not Scotland leaves the UK.There are three immediate reasons why the Scottish deficit does not, at present, deter people from voting SNP. The Scottish Government has managed the finances of Holyrood reasonably competently over the past decade. There is great scepticism about spending arguments, which voters tend to dismiss as Project Fear.Thirdly, departure from the UK would not happen overnight, and there would be complex financial and trading negotiations before the Union was dissolved.But forget all that, because the urge for freedom trumps any argument over a few billions in tax revenues. Scottish voters know, intuitively, that Scotland is a relatively wealthy country, better off than most regions of England. Labour productivity is comparable to the UK average. Scotland has prodigious natural resources and a highly educated workforce. Scotland has the national income of Portugal and the population of Slovakia.Thatrsquos all they need to know. Indeed, were I advising the SNP, Irsquod say they should stop agonising about currency, fiscal transfers and deficits. What will defeat those arguments is not more numbers, but the emotional appeal to national identity that won Boris Johnson his election victory.Scots did not vote to leave the European Union.

Factors would move in as soon as the crofts were empty and tear down their roofs or burn them, to prevent them from being re-occupied.In one notorious case the Sutherland Estatersquos man on the ground, Patrick Seller, was charged with culpable homicide after an old woman, who had to be carried out of her home as it was destroyed, died in the days after her eviction.Sellar, who was dismissed from his job during the trial, was acquitted of all charges.

Situated in Bettyhill on the North Coast  Strathnaver Museum is a popular visitor attraction attracting over , visitors in .The refurbishment project will enhance the visitor experience with the creation of an annex building to the north of the church, which will explore the agricultural story of the area.Improvements to the internal layout of the church will also be carried out to open up access to the collection and create dedicated research spaces where people can study some of the records held by the museum.As well as the vital building work, Strathnaver Museum will also run a three-year community programme of activities to help share and gather knowledge about the heritage of Mackay Country. The main theme will be the Highland Clearances and explore topics such as land use, culture, migration, industry and politics.In  internal alterations saw the removal of the two galleries and the insertion of some party walls. The refurbishment plans have been drawn up by Bonar Bridge based CH Architecture and will see the removal of some of these party walls and install a bridge link which will give visitors an idea of the view from the galleries of the pulpit and lower gallery.Tommy Mackay Strathnaver Museum Chairman said ldquoWe are delighted to have been awarded funding by the Natural and Cultural Heritage Fund towards our refurbishment project. The funding will allow us to enhance the visitor experience, sustain jobs and the services we deliver and enable us to continue to promote the natural and cultural heritage of our area and the Highlands more widely.Francesca Osowska, SNH Chief Executive, added: ldquoA key priority for SNH is to help ensure tourism and other sectors benefit from, and invest in, Scotlandrsquos high quality environment.ldquoNature and culture are closely linked in the Highlands  Islands, and in many places they are central to the local economy, maintaining rural populations, jobs and skills.

But not because supporting indyref would leave the party worse off. It just wouldn’t be enough to tackle the big, central, yawning problem tugging away at the soul of the People’s Party north of the Border since managerialism first gripped New Labour under Tony Blair. What is Scottish Labour’s raison d’etre  What are its core beliefs  In a country where the SNP speaks the language of social democracy and Conservatives have stolen the clothes of unionism– literally what’s left The answer seems is currently a torn-looking lucky bag of assorted and often contradictory policies.For example, Scottish Labour wants a public sector bid to run the Scotrail franchise, but opposes devolving powers so Holyrood can scrap the hopeless franchising process and set up a publicly-owned Scottish railway instead. The party does wants to scrap franchising across the whole UK, except that won’t happen for another five years at least. So, what’s good for British voters , is not good for Scottish voters . Go figure. In a similar guddle, Scottish Labour voted to scrap the UK’s Trident nuclear missile system on the Clyde in , but meekly deferred to UK party policy that supports renewal in their  and  manestos. The party wants a living wage that’s a bit higher than the SNP, a Green Deal that’s a lot less radical than the Scottish Greens’ and a policy on Europe – well let’s tiptoe swtly past that mess. Yip, the absence of a coherent line on independence really is the least of Scottish Labour’s problems. Put simply, the party has no soul. No guiding star by which to steer the rough waters of political dissent. No overriding conviction or analysis to compel attention, drive direction and dictate logical positions on thorny issues like independence. Instead Scottish Labour is engaged in a very public and very naked cost benefit analysis of whether to change position on Scotland’s continuing membership of the union. No matter which way it goes, the grubby process will hardly create instant throngs of admiring converts. The truth is that Scottish Labour is stuck opposing independence for all the wrong reasons – in all circumstances, in any weather and no matter what socialist outcomes might be possible north of the Border. All because independence is the sole objective of the party that stole Labour’s birthright in  and – in the eyes of many – will never, ever be forgiven.Hating the SNP bends Scottish Labour further out of shape than any position on independence, because it defies logic, it overwhelms rival motivations , it consumes integrity and reduces politics to the boring business of automatically contradicting the SNP.Argument, to paraphrase Monty Python, is an intellectual process – a connected series of statements intended to establish a proposition. Contradiction is just the automatic gainsaying of any statement the other person makes.But that’s what Scottish Labour is reduced to – automatically gainsaying the party that usurped its place, policies, heartlands and voters  years ago.This enduring grudge match fuels nonsensical soundbites like Richard Leonard’s tweet on New Year’s Day: “Johnson’s hard-right Brexit makes me fear for Scotland’s future, but it’s no reason to accept austerity in a separate Scotland as the least worst option.” Whit Or Monica Lennon’s proposal for a separate Scottish Labour party – apparently prompted by John McDonnell’s acceptance of the case for indyref last summer, when he overrode Richard Leonard. But a second vote is now what Ms Lennon wants too. So why the need for a separate party then  Unless it’s because Scotland has a distinct political culture. But accepting that means accepting quite a lot of the case for independence too.So, it’s perfectly true – aping the SNP’s pro-independence  will get Scottish Labour no further than hysterically avoiding it. Any change must be driven by some demonstrable logic – by a conviction that the important, distinctive things Scottish Labour believes in cannot now be delivered within a pan-British context. That’s the big, dficult, public debate the party must now have to create direction and win some respect.Is it worth hanging on within the union, in the vain hope that a new Labour leader can somehow win over English voters  If it isn’t, then Scottish Labour has the reason it needs to make a bold change of direction on independence. Changing tack for any less coherent reason will simply lack credibility. Independence for the sake of independence is kinda taken. Indeed, independence for the sake of dignity, equality and workers’ rights is kinda taken too. So, Scottish Labour should copy its much-reviled political nemesis in one regard only – it must find a shared transformational core belief and use it as the template around which all other policies must fit – including independence.It’s too late for a cynical rebranding exercise. The only options left for Scottish Labour are to vacate the political space they currently inhabit in favour of a new left party or to completely repurpose Scottish Labour. That could be done without reference to any other party, by revisiting the legacy of Tom Johnston – the inspiring wartime Labour Scottish Secretary whose portrait hung in Bute House during Alex Salmond’s years as First Minister. Johnston’s dislike of landed privilege was so great that all copies of his incendiary  book Our Noble Families had to be found and destroyed before he could persuade landowners to accept hydro-electric schemes on their land in the s. His instinct for a small-scale, decentralised, municipal state led him to set up a Building Society in his native Kirkintilloch so that local people’s savings could also finance council services.Johnston might have led Labour and Scotland towards the same kind of decentralised state Norway and Sweden have become,his instincts had prevailed. A modern, re-worked, vision of Johnston’s, empowered, decentralised society is practically the only unoccupied political space in Scotland. Will Scottish Labour dare to explore it or just keep grafting on policies, trying hard not to bang into the SNP, Tories or Greens along the way ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

He compares what he describes as “the dream” of cultural empowerment and “the grind” of electoral strategy, with pragmatic political gain often being a motivating factor among parties when it came to supporting devolution.The book traces the influence of magazines such as Scottish International, Radical Scotland and Edinburgh Review, as well as the fiction of William McIlvanney, James Kelman, Irvine Welsh, AL Kennedy and James Robertson.“Novels and poems are not what made the Scottish Parliament happen,” Hames said in an interview with Scotland on Sunday.“But literary culture did play an important role in re-branding devolution as a creative feat of imagination in ways that appealed to the public and flattered the political parties – who had been grinding away at ious thwarted proposals for decades.“Viewed in political and electoral terms, devolution is not a very uplting story. “Re-cast as a cultural cause and project it becomes much more stirring and vivid. “However, the resulting myth of cultural devolution tends to mask the limits, compromises and Britishness of devolution.”He continued: “By the time of the Scottish Constitutional Convention, devolution can be viewed as an elite project, supported by almost every powerful institution in Scotland. “Within that coalition, the role of writers and critics was to give a kind of cultural imprimatur to a devolutionary establishment-in-waiting. Its oppositional clout dwindled considerably, and today Scottish literary culture is fairly cosy with the aims and ethos of devolved government.”Ahead of the  referendum on Scottish independence much was made of the number of writers who publicly endorsed a Yes vote.Hames believes the unormity of opinion among artists was exaggerated, but added that many would still back independencean indyref was to take place.“I would imagine ious prominent Scottish writers will take up quite dferent positions, from radical critique to pragmatic support of the Yes prospectus, with a small number of vocal unionists,” he continued.“Whether writers on the same side, constitutionally, are willing to argue in public is another matter. “The boosterism of Scottish culture was greatly and regrettably enhanced by the first indyref, and while a counter-reaction is long overdue, the salience of Scottishness in electoral politics encourages a great deal of caution and self-censorship.”Jenner Robertson, who served as the head of PR for the Yes Scotland campaign before the  vote, said: “Artists have been a prominent part of the campaign for Scottish independence for as long as I can remember. “That intensied during the  referendum with many playing a leading role in the public campaign. “Where culture leads politics follows and I expect even more artists will campaign vocerously for Yes in indyref in a Boris and Brexit era.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"disruption looms as northlink issues ferries update ","story":"Sailings on the NorthLink ferries are not expected toto normal until at least this Saturday as weather conditions deteriorate.NorthLink have warned that due to the weather forecast disruptions are likely to affect Friday#s sailings as well as the previously announced delays to services on Thursday nd January.will now depart Lerwick for Aberdeen at its normal scheduled time of pm on Thursday evening, as opposed to the previously announced time of pm. will sail from Aberdeen at pm, and will still only travel as far as Kirkwall. southbound sailing from Aberdeen to Lerwick, which is scheduled to depart at pm.

But away from Stormont it’s clear that the PSNI and its still relatively new Chief Constable have a lot of work to do in order to undo the damage done in what’s been a year of reversals and missteps for an organisation that appears to have lost its direction and purpose. Not to put too fine a point on it, it’s been a disaster for the PSNI vis a vis its relationship with the nationalist community. The support the new policing arrangements were given to allow devolution to forge ahead was contingent on a number of factors, most of which have either fallen by the wayside or are being flagrantly disregarded. At the most basic level, the urgent requirement for the policing service to reflect the community it serves has never been met –on the contrary, it now appears to be in reverse with calls growing for ato - recruitment. Coming two decades after the formation of the PSNI, this is desperately disappointing and places a question mark over the very concept of fair and balanced policing. But to make things immeasurably worse, the performance of Simon Byrne in the top job has led many to question the wisdom of his appointment. Any casual observation of recent history will reveal that there is no appetite within the nationalist political family for knee-jerk targeting of new PSNI Chief Constables. But when the PSNI needs to be held to account it is held to account in a robust and positive manner – the legacy issue being a recurring source of contention. But in the seven months since Mr Byrne took on the role, we’ve seen an extraordinary series of what we might charitably call unfortunate events – some cynical and deliberate acts, some common or garden incompetence – which have been incredibly debilitating to law and order in the north and which mean that the coming year is one in which his ability to see out his contract is going to be put under very serious scrutiny. First and most worrying is Mr Byrne’s increasing determination to use the PSNI as a bulwark against progress on the aforementioned legacy issue. His decision to go the Supreme Court to appeal adverse rulings on legacy investigations has seen him park the PSNI tank on the lawn of victims and survivors. His extraordinarily brutish threat to take children away from their parents quite frankly left some experienced observers here open-mouthed in astonishment. And his handling of summer bonfire issues – in particular the Avoniel and New Lodge stand-offs – underlined concerns around whether he’s possessed of the necessary insight and tactical nous to lead the PSNI forward. And to put the tin hat on an annus horribilis for policing here, Mr Byrne decided to pose for a Christmas pic with heavily armed officers at Crossmaglen barracks, to the consternation of nationalist politicians. Entirely unsurprising entirely unacceptable.

Foreigners will take time to digest the following Gaelic names: Caoimhe, Oisín, Siobhán, Niamh and a host of others. There is a historical context to this and this could just be the colonial remnants that were left in Africa as official languages! But that’s not an excuse, we must spell your names correctly and we hope you compliment migrants likewise. Udhi nade jo Belfast  . Its dholuo language spoken by people of the Luo community.

Most Africans are in many cases authoritatively bilingual, spoken and written, no supernatural powers there, just a fact of le and that’s before you include the colonial language English, French etc, so effectively trilingual. In many encounters Africans residing in Ireland are often politely teased with the query, can you speak African please  Honestly, we don’t get offended by that question, generally the interlocutor would probably have assumed that “Africa” is a Pan-African language.

The population of perhaps the total sum of  African countries as represented in Belfast could be in the thousands – although being hypothetical is not my cup of tea.

Mr Caraher had been the victim of systemic harassment by the RUC in the lead-in to the Royal Marines shooting him dead. The harassing RUC were based at Crossmaglen Barracks. Sited beside Crossmaglen Rangers GAA club, RUC officers and British army soldiers had to be flown in via helicopter in military operations. All while the people who actually lived in the place trained, played and socialised in the GAA grounds on its doorstep. It was a physical epitome of occupation. Social media at Christmas is usually the pretty standard fare of hope and goodwill to all. Sadly, the PSNI’s Chief Constable social media was a wholly dferent offering, echoing Christmases Past in South Armagh. His pictures came from Crossmaglen , a strange choice of venue given the PSNI barracks in Crossmaglen has transformed from the days of conflict and is only open a few hours a week. Tuesday and Thursday from am-pm and on a Saturday from pm-pm. Not Wednesdays, not Christmas Day . But it was not the out-of-hours visit that caused people to stop in their tracks. It was the picture of Mr Byrne with four of his colleagues, two of them posing with heavy-duty rles. It was reminiscent of the heavy, dark days of conflict when the RUC would stand posing in their militarised version of disgraced policing. And all of the resulting echoes of the RUC, militarisation, shoot-to-kill and disgrace evoked by those photographs were heard loud and clear on Christmas Day as we read the tweet in disbelief. The response was unanimous from the population of Crossmaglen and the politicians that represent it: that it was ill-judged at best, and in no way reflected the contextual reality for modern policing. The wider response from commentators, journalists and others on social media was equally swt. This was an unwarranted, unhelpful and bizarre tweet and another misstep from a tone-deaf Chief Constable. This was in further evidence on St Stephen’s Day when he refused to withdraw the tweet and issued a statement justying the display of heavy weaponry as reflecting the terrorist threat his officers operate with. Presumably on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and Saturday evenings. It insulted the intelligence of anyone with half a genuine concern. His response displays the signs of a a weak man trying to act hard and when called out refuses to accept responsibility and blames the “bad boys”. The six counties have never had acceptable policing. Policing has always operated at dferent stages of history to reinforce British occupation: the Protestant State for a Protestant People since partition British military policy during the conflict and extremely sinister policies of shoot to kill and collusion. The PSNI is meant to be the new beginning we deserve and need. Human rights-compliant, accountable, community-based, responsive and supported policing that meets our needs as a community in its entirety. Many of us have tried to make that potential a reality. This Chief Constable doesn’t get it and, most worryingly of all, he appears to be too arrogant in his approach to learn. If policing was in crisis under George Hamilton for its defence of the RUC, which it was, then things have worsened under the clueless Mr Byrne."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers.

Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"forget bridge tunnel best way to link northern ireland and great britain say experts","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Instead, they favour the construction of a tunnel under the Irish Sea. In fact, the plan is for two tunnels - one from England to the Isle of Man, and a second from the Isle of Man to Co Down.They say their proposal would be better than a bridge, as a rail tunnel would not be at the mercy of bad weather, and would avoid the problems in spanning Beaufort Dyke, a deep sea trench in the North Channel containing a million tonnes of dumped wartime munitions.The plan is part of a broader list of tunnel projects put forward by the society. They include a tunnel from Hampshire to the Isle of Wight, another under the Bristol Channel between the West Country and Wales, and a new tunnel under the Thames.Bill Grose, lead author of the ICE report, told the Sunday Times: \"A tunnel starting north of Liverpool that surfaced in the Isle of Man and then went back under to reach Belfast would solve all the problems\" he said.\"Tunnels are less prone to bad weather, and construction is getting faster and cheaper every year.\"The distance from England to the Isle of Man is around  miles, and from the Isle of Man to Northern Ireland is just over  miles.Mr Grose, a former chairman of the British Tunnelling Society, added: \"As prices continue to fall, tunnels will become increasingly attractive as a way of connecting the United Kingdom.\"It cost about £m per kilometre for a twin rail tunnel, but costs are falling. When we reduce them by another %, tunnelling will become popular and very long tunnels become feasible.\"Tunnels and bridges cost much the same - but tunnels are not prone to bad weather.\"The ambitious proposals are surfacing as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is known to be interested in major construction projects to unite the UK in the post-Brexit era.In September last year it was learned that Mr Johnson had asked Government officials for advice on the costs and risks of building a bridge from Scotland to Northern Ireland.Initial estimates put the cost at around £bn. The worlds longest railway tunnel is the -mile St Gotthard Base tunnel under the Swiss Alps, which opened in ."},{"url":null,"title":"full list of northern ireland new years honours","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Gregory Campbell said - deal or no deal - ato the ballot box would be \"pointless\".The East Londonderry MP said an election would see parties harden their positions making any deal after a vote much more dficult to achieve. \"I struggle to see the sense or rationale in the Secretary of State calling an electiona deal is not agreed,\" he said.\"The vast majority of people will be asking what are we voting for. The big issues would remain and we would have four or five weeks campaigning with parties digging into previously stated positions and not moving from them. How does that help \"And although no one should second guess the result, maybe other than a few seats ups or down, the DUP and Sinn Fein would be ed as the two biggest parties.\"He saidthere was a deal the current mandate should be allowed to run its course to allow the people judge how successful a deal,any, was. \"The best thing to do is to get a deal everyone can live with, stop ponticating. An Election would make matters worse.\"Read MoreSmith to give PM progress report on Stormont talksNorthern Ireland has been without a devolved administration for the past three years. Sinn Fein collapsed the institutions in January  in the wake of the ongoing RHI scandal and what the party called a series of broken promises on an Irish language act and legacy matters.Talks resumed last week after the Christmas break. Ahead of the festive period the process was paused with Secretary of State Julian Smith saying the DUP was not on board, meaning a text of a potential agreement could not be published. There have been growing calls for an election ahead of any resumption of power sharing. The former MLA Eamonn McCann, who lost his seat in the snap poll in  following the collapse of the institutions, said the people should be allowed to speak.The People Before Profit Derry Strabane District Councillor said: \"There should be noto Stormont without an Assembly election. Parties which did nothing but manoeuvre for advantage for three wasted years should not automatically be handed back seats. \"If Stormont were reanimated under present circumstances, Arlene Foster would be First Minister, Michelle ONeill DFM, the RHI report unpublished, party strengths on the Hill frozen at  levels. Anybody cheering for that outcome  We need an election. Let the people speak.\"Our Friday, we asked readers on our Facebook pagethey thought an election should be held before MLAs again take their seats.Just over , votes were cast with % saying there should be ato the polls. DUP MP Gregory Campbell was one of the  - or % - to vote against.VOTE: Indications suggest power sharing at Stormont could be restored in the coming days. But there have been calls for an election to be held ahead of anyof our MLAs. What do you think Posted by Belfast  on Friday, January , Mr Campbell saidthe parties did reach agreement they should be allowed to complete the mandate which runs out in  months to allow the people to \"cast judgment\" on the work done during that period. He added: \"It would be wrong to convene an election when there is no Assembly or Executive up and running. \"Likewise it would be intolerable to let the mandate run its course and have nothing reconstituted. It would be as unacceptable then as it is now, it would be counterproductive.\"He added: \"We should get a deal. Let the mandate run its course and then the people can decide onit was a good or bad deal.\"Gregory Campbell of the DUPThere has been a legal obligation to hold an Assembly election since the parties failed to form an Executive after the March  election.The law currently states an assembly election must be called should there be no agreement between the parties by Monday, January . Similar deadlines over the past three years have been put back through a series of law changes. Secretary of State Julian Smith has hinted an election could be called.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith Mr Campbell saidthere was no agreement by Monday all eyes would be on the Secretary of States next move. He said the DUP was prepared \"financially and physically\" for anyto the ballot box.\"Any analysis I have seen says Sinn Fein is due to suffer a much bigger loss of seats than the DUP. AndSinn Fein are up for that, that is their business.\"An election would make matters worse... but the DUP is ready for an election next month - should it come.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Business leaders said no-deal would have proved disastrous. The farming community was facing devastation with the loss of EU subsidies coupled with new trade tarfs between north and south. Experts warned that farmers would be left facing bankruptcy.A real issue for all was the lack of clarity about what any potential Brexit would mean for Northern Ireland. Everyone had an opinion on what Brexit would mean. When Mr Johnson ed with his new deal from the EU, it became known as the Betrayal Act by loyalists who saw it as a threat to the Union. They claimed it put an economic border in the Irish Sea and meant Northern Ireland would be treated dferently to the rest of the UK.Disagreements about what it all means for Northern Ireland will continue in the next  months.July: Lowry wins at PortrushJuly saw the worlds best golfers and thousands of golf fans flock to the north coast as Royal Portrush hosted The Open for the first time in almost  years.The championship generated more than £ million of economic benefit for Northern Ireland, according to a study commissioned by organisers and proved a real boost to the tourist industry with hotels sold out and fans flocking to the scenic location from across the world - , fans arrived on the north coast with more than half coming from outside Northern Ireland.Shane LowryThe figures helped boost predictions that  will be a record breaking year for tourism in Northern Ireland with .m people expecting to have visited in the year.Irish winner Shane Lowry lted the coveted Claret Jug at the end of the event, six shots clear of nearest challenger, Englands Tommy Fleetwood.

The DUP suffered a third blow in North Down where the Alliance Partys Stephen Farry claimed the seat vacated by independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon.Nigel DoddsWhile the DUP finished the election down from  seats to eight, Sinn Fein saw their majorities slashed across Northern Ireland - Mr Finucanes win tempered by a crushing defeat for Elisha McCallion in Foyle.

He said issues that were being consistently raised included the availability of ambulances and a dearth of staff working in health clinics and hospitals.“Traditionally, at this time of year the demand on health services starts to build, but what is dferent this time is that we have seen an increase in the number of constituents who are coming to us over hospital admissions.“People waiting for surgery, for a consultant appointment- I even had someone with me recently waiting on cancer treatment.“There is no doubt about it, the health system is under pressure, both locally and further afield. It is a resource issue- we need more staff, more consultants, more doctors and more nurses. Those working in our health care system are left coping with the huge demand and are feeling the pressure. We need to invest in staff and we need to do it now,” he said. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last year the Christmas Tree Recycling Scheme raised around pound, and it is hoped that with the support of locals a similar total,not more, can be gathered this time round.Foyle Hospice will accept a suggested donation of pound and once collected the trees will be shredded for use in its Culmore Road gardens. Money raised will be directed towards the palliative care of patients with cancer and other le-limiting illnesses such as Multiple Sclerosis, Motor Neurone Disease, Parkinsons Disease and COPD.The scheme provides a simple, environmentally friendly and the most charitable way to dispose of your Christmas tree.A Hospice spokesperson said: “We all “joyfully choose our Christmas tree and transport it home ready to dress for the festive period.“However, after “th night” when its needles are dropping the thought of taking it to the household recycling centre or chopping it up to fit into your bin is less appealing.“So, Foyle Hospice and our wonderful team of volunteers will collect your tree on Monday th to Wednesday th January  for a small donation.“We are delighted this year to have received sponsorship for this initiative from Seagate Ltd, who are also providing volunteers to help with the mammoth task of the collection of the trees.“Once collected. We work with our own volunteers and our corporate partners at Elagh Tree Surgery, who give up their time to chip and shred trees and these chips, are recycled for use within the Hospice grounds.”You can book your collection today by registering on the following link: https:register.primoevents ps event ChristmasTreeRecyclingSchemeIf you have any questions please e-mail: fundraising @foylehospice or telephone   googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ebenezer Scrooge wasnt the first fictional character to see ghosts at this time of year. In fact the tradition probably goes back further than Christmas itself. As the nights grow long and the year creeps towards its close its a natural instinct that people gather together. Its also natural that this time makes us think of people and places that are no longer here. These thoughts have often morphed into tales based on what we encounter at this time of year - winter, death and the eventual rebirth experienced in spring. googletag.cmd.push In Europe this was usually connected to the pagan rituals surrounding the winter solstice known as Yule. The shortest and darkest day of the year was viewed as a time when the dead would have access to the living. The telling of tales at Yuletide began to decline as TV took over as the main form of household entertainment, but it must also be remembered that when Dickens published A Christmas Carol in  the tradition of Christmas itself was also in decline. In fact, for most people in that era Christmas was a working day because the Industrial Revolution meant fewer days off for everyone. As a result, Christmas was considered relatively unimportant and no one really complained. googletag.cmd.push The beginning of disregarding Christmas had come courtesy of Oliver Cromwell around  years earlier. The puritanical Lord Protector of England who in the th Century was “on a mission to cleanse the nation of its most decadent excesses.” These excesses unfortunately included banning Christmas celebrations, its ghostly tales and traditions with even carols making his draconian hit list. Oliver Cromwell is of course remembered in Ireland for his other exploits including the deaths of thousands of people as the result of his orders. But despite his best efforts he failed to quell the traditions of folklore carried over from pre-Christian Ireland. In the Irish tradition, ghosts are called taidhbhse or tais and live in a place halfway between this le and the next. The spirits are held here by some earthly affection or unfulfilled duty or anger against the living. Those who die suddenly, more commonly than others, are believed to become haunting Ghosts. They go about moving the furniture, and in every way trying to attract attention. It was also believed that when the soul has left the body, it is drawn away, sometimes, by the fairies. Such souls are considered lost. If a soul eludes the fairies, it may be snapped up by the evil spirits. The weak souls of young children were especially in danger. In western Ireland for example, people sprinkled the threshold with the blood of a chicken when a very young child died so that the spirits may be drawn away to the blood. A ghost was also compelled to obey the commands of the living. One old tale said, the stable-boy up met the master going round the yards after he had been two days dead, and told him to be away with him to the lighthouse, and haunt that and there he is far out to sea still. Oscar Wildes mother who studied and wrote about the supernatural thought it was only spirits who were too bad for heaven, and too good for hell, who were caught halfway between paradise and damnation. It was also thought that the souls of the dead sometimes took the shapes of animals. They will sometimes take the forms of insects, especially butterflies. If you see one fluttering near a corpse, that is the soul, and is a sign of its having entered upon immortal happiness. The author of the Parochial Survey of Ireland, , heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly, How do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather. Spirits who remain inside houses can also take on many shapes, including that of the elf and sometimes also of a rat, cat, or black dog. In their natural state they are invisible to people, but they can become visible in these forms. They make a lot of noise in the house at night and live between the walls, in the attic or in the cellar, in the stable, in the shed, sometimes even in a large tree beside the house. These ghosts are not considered particularly intelligent, and remain friendly as long as they are treated well. They like to tease lazy people by pulling the blankets off their beds and sending icy drafts through the room. They also delight in knocking over milk pails and keeping people awake by constantly tapping on the walls. When made very angry, they become malevolent. Their noise making becomes unbearable they throw stones, the cattle become sick, drought or cold weather or continuous storms occur. They leave the house or farm only when it has been totally overwhelmed by disaster and is lost. And, there is a well-known local wintry ghostly tale which refers to The Lady in the Snow which is said to have happened on the outskirts of Derry. The story is of two children, a brother and sister who were playing in the snow near a small stream near Enagh Lough. They were making a snowman and gradually they moved closer and closer to the water until they were standing on the ice. A woman dressed in a grey coat and a fur muff approached them, warning them of the danger. She coaxed them back to the bank just as the ice began to crack. She asked where they lived and she advised them to go home. The little girl askedshe could walk home with them andshe could put her hands in the muff to make them warm. The woman put the muff on the little girl and they chatted as they walked. She told them that she had a little girl who went into the water through the ice and warned them to be careful. At the gate she took her muff back and watched them being greeted at the door by their mother. They were both pointing at the lady and gesticulating but the mother saw no one. However she went to the gate because the children were so convinced that a lady had walked home with them. On the snow there were only the footprints of her children. When the snow melted a muff was found near the lake. The little girl knew it was the one that the lady wore.

For decade upon decade, especially in rural Ireland, New Years Eve was about exactly that - staying in. New Year was never truly a big thing in Ireland - especially for farming communities for who the fortunes of the crops were all important. Irish New Year traditions in agricultural areas, such as they are, are all about the coming twelve months. One belief was that no water could be drawn from the well after the sun went down on New Years Eve. All the water required needed to be inside the house before that and none of it could leave the house until the next day. Defying this belief meant that the family would be faced with a drought in the new year. googletag.cmd.push There was also a tradition that no money could be spent on New Years Day. Nothing could be brought out of a home and anyone visiting should make sure they came bearing a gt. Giving something away meant giving your money away and surely no sensible person would do that. The stroke of midnight on December  carried traditions of its own. Being the first visitor to a house on New Years Day was a popular custom but the warmth of your welcome was largely dependent on the colour of your hair. Unless he arrived empty handed, a dark haired man would be greeted gladly because it was believed that he would bring plenty of good luck. However, a red headed womans arrival meant ill fortune evenher arms were weighed down with all the tokens of what was known as first footing - bread and coal. Red haired females apparently tended to stay at home on New Years Eve. googletag.cmd.push In fact to prevent bad luck, families sometimes sent out a dark haired member of the family immediately after midnight and had them walk back in though the door. All dark haired boys in the area would visit the houses and be welcomed with gts of sweets or money. Anything bad that happened on New Years Eve was considered more signicant the closer it was to midnight. It was believed that there was only a certain amount of luck in the world and everything that could be done to claim a share of it had to be done. It was also important to begin the New Year with a spotlessly clean house signying a fresh start to the New Year. New Years Eve was also known as “Oiacuteche na Coda Moacuteire,”- ‘the night of the big portion’ since people would eat a larger than normal meal to ensure food in plenty for the coming year. Another way of ensuring plenty was to make a cake which was then pounded against the door of the house three times while a prayer was said by the housewe. This would chase the bad luck out of the house and invite the good spirits in. In other areas the man of the house would take three bites out of the cake and then throw it against the front door, in the name of the Trinity and banish hunger from the house. After this the family would then gather up the fragments of the cake and eat it. Many farmers repeated this ceremony at the door of the byre to ensure plentul fodder for the cows. People tried to ensure that no food was taken away from the house on New Years Eve and beggars knew better than to approach a house looking for food. Another New Years Eve Irish tradition was that young girls put mistletoe under their pillows on New Year’s Eve, in hopes of dreaming about their future husband. On New Year’s Eve night, families would remember those who has passed away that year before by setting a place for them at the dinner table and leaving the door unlatched. Anyone entering the house after midnight by the front door would leave by the back door for good luck. Well into the evening on New Years Eve in Ireland there would always be a small group gathered around the fireplace, laughing and joking. Sooner or later, the conversation would turn to reminiscing about Ireland. The old ones, well on their way with a few glasses of the hard stuff, would get all misty-eyed as they remembered times past and the stories would begin in the light of just the fire and candles burning in the windowsill. There was also an Irish tradition of predicting the political future of the country by checking which way the wind blows at midnight on New Year’s Eve. If the wind is from the west, there is a chance that good fortune will reign that year. If the wind is from the east, however, the British will prevail. And,after the stroke of midnight the man of the house would recite the following verse: “May your nets always be full, Your pockets never empty, Your horse not cast a shoe, Nor the devil look at you In the coming year.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Meanwhile, EU leaders drown migrants in the Mediterranean, provide arms and political cover for dictatorships infor contracts with European companies, collude in Zionist assaults on Palestinian rights, etc.But everywhere, too, there is revolt. Chile, Hong Kong, France, Catalonia, Iraq, Sudan, etc, have all seen millions in the streets against the rule of the rich over the poor. In Lebanon, a by-word for communal hostility, Sunni, Shia, Christians and Druze have come together in angry array against the elites.Young people in unprecedented numbers have swamped cities demanding radical action to save the planet.Long struggle has finally won abortion rights for Irish women, North and South, and equal marriage in the North.There’s evidence everywhere that the isions which keep the working class enchained can begin to melt in the heat of struggle.In Ireland, the battle lines are drawn between those who want unity of the oppressed in pursuit of a better world and defenders of the riven status quo.The battle is unequal. The forces of the Right seem in the ascendant. But  has also shown the depth of resilience and the fighting capacity of plain people. The magnitude of the masses shouting out across continents has had the character of a global uprising.It is in this that socialists find hope for the future, across all Ireland as throughout the world.Orange and Green politics are useless when it comes to defending the NHS, resisting job losses, opposing welfare “reform,” fighting for civil rights for all, etc.What’s needed is to drive forward and expand the emerging struggle all around us. The same perspective lights the way to Irish unity.Homeless deaths on the streets, hospital patients stacked in corridors, teachers run ragged in over-crowded class-rooms, workers denied union rights, State corruption, a suicide epidemic - all these apply in equal measure North and South. It is by bringing these struggles together that we can transcend the borders within and between us.We in People Before Profit put all our trust in the indomitability of the working class of the world.Pessimism is a weapon to be used against us. We don’t believe we won’t win. Here and everywhere, the vanquished of today will be the victors of tomorrow.These are the perspectives which guide us in our work in trades unions, civil rights campaigns, the environmental movement, and in all .We urge all who sympathise with this approach to join us in struggle in the year to come. googletag.cmd.push Eamonn McCann googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A video introducing Brooke Scullion revealed that she works in a petting zoo but is allergic to animals - its okayI just dont breathe in, she joked. She was joined by her two biggest fans, grannies Peggy and Sheila. They described her as a very lively and bubbly wee girl adding singing is her dream. Before taking to the stage Brooke said: Theres nothing  in the world that gives me the feeling that performing does. To go through would be amazing. This is the biggest opportunity that Ive ever had. googletag.cmd.push The -year-olds version of Lewis Capaldis Bruises prompted Will.I.Am and Meghan Trainor to turn instantly. They were quickly followed by Olly Murs and Tom Jones. As the performance unfolded Sir Toms eyes were visibly bulging as he digested her vocal range.   Each of the judges implored the -year-old to join their team. Will.I.Am told her he had to turn after three words, Meghan said she was obsessed already and believes Brooke can be a superstar. Tom added that her voice is tremendous, shes wonderful and Olly lauded her as fantastic. After telling Tom Jones that both of her grannies were single and Olly Murs that one of them fancied a toy boy, Brooke eventually settled on American singer songwriter Meghan Trainor. googletag.cmd.push Meghan said she felt the competition was won already so impressed was she with Brookes talent. Each coach needs  acts for the next stages - the battle rounds - and will be seen fighting over the best acts. As always, the coaches had their backs to the stage so they can only base their decision to pick an act on the voice alone. Each of the contestants who step out on stage must hold their nerve as they perform in the hope of seeing at least one chair spins round. Butno coaches turn then the contestant leaves the stage immediately as the coaches remain with their backs to the stage, never seeing who performed. After the auditions comes the Battles where the Coaches reduce their teams by half but, with the opportunity to steal one act each from another coach, they will take six through per team to the Knockouts. If Brooke successfully negotiates the Knockouts she will earn a place in the live shows where the public will ultimately crown the winner of The Voice .

Waterworth promptly stepped up and fired Linfield into the lead.That lead was doubled within minutes as Stute caved in completely. Brogans initial effort was tipped over by Brown, but from the corner, Waterworth flicked on and Haughey turned the bal home from close range to make it -. It should have been - by the half time break, but again Brown came to the rescue, denying Cooper who should ahve scored, but regardless, Linfield were comfortable at the break, whilst Stute had a huge mountain to climb. googletag.cmd.push Half Time -The chances just kept coming for Linfield as Lavery broke clear on goal but with just Brown to beat he shot wide. Stute then had the woodwork to thank for keeping the score down as Millars delivery was met by Haughey but his weffort bounced back off the post into Browns arms.There was little sign of any come back from Stute and the chances con tinued to come for the home side who were proving wasteful in front of goal, as Waterworth went one on one with Brown only for the Stute goalkeeper to come out on top again. The third goal eventually did come and the superb Cooper created it as he raced away from his marker before cutting the ball back to substitute Jordan Stewart, whose close range strike was outstandingly kept out by Brown, but Lavery was on hand to turn home the loose ball in from close range. Institute take a break from league action when they host Dungannon Swts at the Brandywell in the Irish Cup this weekend. The teams palayed out an entertaining - draw when Swts lasted visited Stute last month.

His close friends and running colleagues tried every trick in the book to ascertain the route for the annual Castlewellan Christmas Cracker, but uncharacteristically lsquoThe Prophetrsquo remained tight-lipped and taciturn. The usual platitudes and prosaicisms were thrown out by way of appeasement, but they threw no light on the course that has been in the planning since January .Phrases like, lsquothere is something for everyonersquo, lsquothere will be a few good climbsrsquo, lsquowe will go through a field or tworsquo and lsquoI still have a few ditches to clearrsquo served only to add intrigue and mystique to the potential route.From am, parking spaces were snaffled up as the growing crowds made their way to collect their numbers, totally unaware of what lay ahead, another unique characteristic of this now iconic event.When we go to races we usually know what lies ahead as it will be the same as the previous year mdash not so with this one.This led to great speculation at registration and the passing of spurious rumours, lsquoIrsquove heard it is Foxes green firstrsquo, lsquoBunkerrsquos Hill is the first climbrsquo, lsquothe gates at Niall Kingrsquos place are open and that can only mean one thing!rsquoThose unwise enough to listen were tormented, while the more sanguine took it all in their stride realising that what would be would be.The atmosphere in the GAA club was electric and filled with excitement as every little corner became a changing space and in the middle of all of this Stevie Rice had set up a stall and had created a monopoly on udderrmint ndash an essential for the discerning runner.With space at a premium, one team had pre-booked the VIP changing facilities in Ned McCartanrsquos front room. Here the gracious, ebullient and effervescent host provided valet parking, bespoke carb-rich pre-race food, handed out warm fluffy towels and proffered words of wisdom and encouragement. The * package was completed with optional dog therapy ndash petting Socks.The  entries were snapped up in a few weeks, such is the popularity of this event among the NI running fraternity.Running in pairs is far from commonplace in what is largely an inidual sport and this certainly brings a welcome new dimension in that you are only as good as your partner and an ill-conceived or sentimental choice could see you standing waiting at the top of a hill, the bottom of a hill or at the finish.The secret lies in getting the right partner, one you know you can work with and whose running skills complement your own ndash a lesson that has still to be learned by a number of this yearrsquos participants.While the event is a great opportunity to dress up, socialise and enjoy the wonderful scenery that Castlewellan has to offer, the racing at the sharp end of the field is seriously fierce.From the moment they were set on their way at the bottom of the Circular Road, the cream rose to the top as the leading teams thundered their way through the town at breakneck speed.Getting good road position at the front is essential for the leading men and women.In , Newcastlersquos Lynch and Hanna were clear winners with a minute and a half to spare over Johnston and Scott of Mourne Runners, with McMullan and Stephens, from the host club, a further  seconds back in third.These three teams were paired once again, but had to settle for second, third and fth respectively. With Hanna in the form of his le and regularly representing Ireland in the hills and Lynch coming off a superb  minute k at the Seeley, they were the in-form team and pre-race favourites.However, favourites do not always win and on this occasion it was Aaron McGrady from East Down and his partner Andrew Barrington, originally from Oban in Scotlandwho emerged victorious.The pair, who run and race together for Victoria Park Harriers in London, were among a group of leaders along the Crow Road.As the course rose steeply after the Moorish Tower, the pair was second behind Lynch and Hanna as they hurtled through the fields towards the Bannanstown Road.As was the case in , the climb over the Playrock Hill would prove decisive and the eventual winners managed to pull away and open a winning lead.However, McGrady admits that once they hit the front, they had to work very hard over the last three miles as they knew the quality of the team chasing them.When asked about the course, the winner said that it was very dferent to previous years, was far less muddy than anticipated and despite the steep hills offered great opportunities for hard fast running.Overall, he considered it to be a well-planned and carefully balanced route. McKinstry was always in contention, but his partner suffered terribly and put paid to their chances of the win ndash they would finish fourth overall.Beechmount Harriers claimed the ladiesrsquo team prize with Sarah Laverty and Catherine Diver finishing in an excellent th place overall ndash all that training up the hill in Falls Park paid off.They were joined on the podium by Hannah Somani and Georgina Wileyand Amanda Perry and Denise Logue .In the mixed category there was a great win for Shalene McMurray and David McNeilly who were th overall and comfortably clear of their nearest challengers and club mates Mari Troeng and Frank Cunningham. Karen Wilton and Andrew Wills of Jog Lisburn completed the mixed team podium.There were male, female and mixed category winners dotted throughout the field and these are highlighted in the results file available on the Newcastle AC website . Well done to everyone who won a prize.Some of the fancy dress was simply amazing and added greatly to the sense of fun that is central to this race. Special mention to the Power family who once again dressed to impress and the three sheep bleated their way around the course under the ever-watchful eye of Bo Peep, the Newry AC crew who were came as the cast of lsquoIrsquom a Celebrityrsquo, but regrettably failed to get out of there and had to complete all nine miles and the Grant family and their friends who looked lsquoCrackingrsquo for the Cracker.Costumes came in all shapes and sizes with superheroes galore and even the odd beach ball shoved up a T-shirt for maximum effect.Before we draw the curtain on this event there are some necessary closing remarks.Firstly, we have to mention some of those who were lsquopale facedrsquo as they crossed the finish line.Among this number were Connaire McVeigh, his brother Brian McVeigh, Noel lsquoWonderwallrsquo Gallagher , Dee Murrayand Patrick Higgins who it would seem invented a new shade of grey.While all of these are notable and honourable mentions, there can only be on winner of such a prestigious accolade.The worthy recipient is none other than Dominic lsquoMad Dogrsquo McGreevy, who by his own admission was lsquoclean burstedrsquo by evergreen Jim Brown before they even left the show field.Whilst cogitating the next day with McVeigh, he noted that there was a distinct lack of climbing in the opening mile which considerably reduced his chances of the overall win.Of course, all of this is pure conjecture, passed on to me by others who were better placed to judge. As these pale faced warriors finished, I was probably getting a drink at Stephen McMullanrsquos pop-up tavern in Leitrim.The day was a great success due to the hard work and planning that took place. Course designer McCrickard would like to thank his incredible team that spent the best park of two days marking ndash Francie McAlinden, Audey McVeigh , Aidan Brownand Donal Ward.Thanks also to the entry management and registration team who did so much work in creating and continually updating and modying the team ndash no small task, the marshals from our own club and neighbouring clubs, the lead cyclists from Shimna Wheelers and Kilmegan CC, the motorbike riders, Robert and Paddy, the finish team and the presentation party ndash too many to name inidually, but you all know who you are.In conclusion, the feedback from the , that completed the course was amazingly positive and a great time was had by all.

Health unions agreed a .% three-year pay rise for NHS staff, excluding doctors, in  but the deal did not apply to Northern Northern because of the absence of devolved government.Nurses based at the Downpatrick hospitals were among an estimated , from the Royal College who went on strike for the first time in the unionrsquos -year history the week before Christmas.The one-day stoppage marked a serious escalation after weeks of industrial action by other healthcareworkers. RCN nurses were joined by their Unison colleagues on the picket line in poor weather, buffeted by wind and rain.Northern Ireland has the worst hospital waiting lists in the UK, according to figures from the Department of Health with some , people waiting for appointments. On average, there is a four-year wait for knee and hip operations.The December  strike mdash which placed pressure on a range of hospital services and resulted in planned out-patient procedures and appointments being cancelled mdash placed increasing pressure on politicians restore the power-sharing assembly and executive at Stormont.During the industrial action, nurses did provide cover to ensure chemotherapy, intensive care and palliative care services at hospitals remained in place, while district nurses only attended emergency calls. A small number of domiciliary home calls were also cancelled.According to the South Eastern Trust,  outpatient appointments were cancelled and , others were not scheduled due to the recent industrial action.Ms Cullen said the local health service could not survive another winter, without improved pay and conditions for NHS staff.ldquoThe health service is in crisis, the senior RCN official continued.ldquoWe have , people on the waiting list for a hospital appointment and we have a severe nursing shortage, which is highlighted by the Nursing and Midwery Council figures.ldquoOur members have been out on strike to fight for patient safety and to improve conditions for everyone. Quite simply, we cannot afford to wait any longer to address the problems facing the health service. Another winter like this and the health service will be irreparably damaged..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Olympic.jpg","title":"Olympic bid for Border Cup glory  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Olympic get a shot at redemption when they confront Rathfriland in todayrsquos eagerly-awaited Border Cup final showdown at Seaview.Last yearrsquos cruel penalty shoot-out defeat to all-conquering Crumlin Star in the final has plagued Olympic ever since and now is the time to put things right.Olympic have proven all the doubters mdash who predicted that they were one-season wonders mdashseriously wrong and they are back in the final on merit.Wins over Holywood , Bloomfield , Dromara Village , Dunmurry Recand Shankill Unitedhave made the rest of the league sit up and take notice for the second year in a row.Liam Sloanrsquos side are also going strongly in the Premier Section and are unbeaten after nine games. However, all that will count for nothing when they walk out at Seaview this afternoon.Sloan knows more than most that cup finals are all about what happens on the day and no amount of preparation or game planning can change that.With Olympic what you see is what you get.There are no prima donnas in the squad and they have all bought into the team ethos ndash one in, all in.The Olympic boss has made a few shrewd signings since last season and the new faces have gelled well with the group.Olympic may have lost top scorer Niall Murray to Crumlin Star, but Stefan Mason has proved more than a capable replacement.Stefan, now in his second spell at the club, joined from Drumaness Mills at the start of the season and his insatiable appetite in a main strikerrsquos role has endeared him to all.He is a nightmare for all defenders as he never stays still and is continually looking for space. He is not afraid to shoot and is also as brave as they come, adding a bit of physicality to his game in recent times.He has formed a perfect partnership with the under-rated Chris McNamara and the potentially explosive Nathan Jones mdash and all three are reliable matchwinners.Paul Dickson, another new signing, first came to prominence a few years ago when he starred for Noel lsquoDixiersquo Deanrsquos emerging Temple Rangers side that famously reached the semi-finals of the Clarence Cup.Since then he has played for Ballynahinch United and Saintfield United, but his adventurous style of play from the back has given Olympic an added dimension to their play.He has been joined in the squad by Anton McGrattan, a stylish midfielder, who gets up and down the park with ease and who is not an easy player to dispossess or put off his game.Basically, the rest of the Olympic remains the same and therein lies the secret of their success. Goalkeeper Ryan Walsh, a member of the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team, has enhanced his growing reputation this season and he rarely makes mistakes.Manager Sloan has the luxury of being able to play a number of formations at the back. Jason Noade is a colossus in the centre of defence with either Stevie McGoran, Connor Reid, Dickson or the highly-rated Dalton Tate flanking him.Midfield enforcer Ryan Noade,he is fit, can also play in the back four, but he, brother Stevie, Shane Murray and workaholic Ryan Molloy make up a formidable midfield unit with McGrattan able to cover any position in the engine room.Olympic have serious strength in depth and James McClean, Aaron McLean, Adam McClean, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Darren Lyons and Reece McConnell are all ready to step up to the markthey are required.However, standing in Olympicrsquos way is one of their own, now making Rathfriland tick.Andy Kilmartin started out at Olympic as a raw teenager with immense talent.He signed for Glasgow Celtic before moving to Glentoran, Portdown and Glenavon where he won an Irish Cup medal.The martinette is now pulling Rathfrilandrsquos strings alongside Newcastlersquos Jonathan Scannell and Downpatrickrsquos Peter Telford and Ruairi Fitzpatrick.Olympic know these players inside out and given a fair wind, they hope to blow Rathfriland away in what promises to be an intriguing final.Coincidentally, this will be Telfordrsquos fth Border Cup final appearance, but he has yet to appear on a winning side.He has lost three finals with Downpatrick FC and one with Kilmore Rec and is hoping that it will be a case of fth time lucky this afternoon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Out.jpg","title":"Out of Africa book looks at richness of sharing humanity together  ","story":"THE latest book by Downpatrick author Dr Stan Papenfus has just been published.Out of Africa has a title that he plagiarised from Pliny, the ancient Roman writer, who wrote: ldquoOut of Africa always something new.The subtitle of this book, lsquoSharing our livesrsquorsquo, derives from an African proverb mdash lsquoA person is a person through peoplersquo. It an also be translated as lsquoA person becomes a person through peoplersquo.The signicance of this proverb becomes ever more clear in the being and becoming of the three story tellers who share their lives with Dr Papenfus.Each one of them expresses and explores the truth of their own experiences and each one has their personal reality confirmed by the events and situations that unfold. In this telling, they also create how they who are and who they can be.Gabriel Makamanzi, from Zimbabwe, specically sees his own problems and dficulties belonging not merely to himself, but to the whole community in which he lives.This community is brought alive for us as he describes it and he expects us to relate it to our own problems and dficulties. In this way, he says, we all work together to discover our own creative freedom and realise our potential.Gabriel notes that le is for love. And yet, without honesty, our personal and shared reality is not reality at all.Instead, it is a pretense and those of us who pretend he sees us ldquoliving meaningless livesrsquorsquo.Dr Papenfus says: ldquoGabrielrsquos story challenges us, as it challenged him, to recognise our own poverty and despair, only to realise the spiritual power and richness of sharing our humanity with each other.The next exploration of time experiences is by Zakele Makaluza, from South Africa. He talks about his arrogance and his refusal to heed the warnings given to him by his ancestors, as they appear to him in his dreams.Zakelersquos experiences also refer to his relationship with bees, but not ordinary bees, rather with those ldquogentlemen of the honeyrsquorsquo sent by his ancestors to remind him of his duties to others, especially to members of his own clan.Dr Stan said: ldquoZakele, in his exploration of his experiences, brings us to an awareness of our own integrity or lack or integrity, in ourselves and in our relationship with others. He realises his potential only after he is persuaded of a certain truth, which he has been denying nearly all his le.ldquoIt is his cousin who opens up his awareness and tells him also that this was an experience that were lsquodestinedrsquo to share.The last person giving his testimony in the book is David Maganda, from Uganda. He came from a very big family and when his father died he was left to fend for himself, especially with regard to earning enough money to pay for his education.Even as a young boy, he secretly took a train from Uganda to Kenya, hoping to make enough money to sponsor his schooling. But, instead, he found himself on a ldquomission impossible as he calls it.He and his friend found themselves stranded and virtually penniless in the city of Nairobi. They had no place to stay, no work and no friends.How are they toto Uganda  They found themselves walking for mile after mile, along long and dusty roads, depending for their very survival on the kindness and pity of strangers. After living through a fierce storm and other hardships, they eventually arrived at the Kenya-Uganda border. Here, in their completely squalid state, they were interrogated by the police, who eventually let them cross the border.Arriving back in Uganda, they miraculously met Davidrsquos friendrsquos sister, who was working at a trading station. And so, at last, they find themselves able tohome.Each of their families get them to promise never again to engage in such a mad exploit. And yet within ten years he finds himself stranded once again, this time in the Sudan.Here, however, he is able to make do by earning money and pursuing some schooling and eventually being presented with a graduation certicate. Because of the particular school he attended, he was also able to become a confirmed Christian. However, he discovers, through his interaction with others, that his Christianity is only lukewarm.Through many strange encounters he eventually learns how to accept Christ into his very heart of hearts.As a result of this, he preaches the good news of salvation and in Northern Sudan he is even beaten and imprisoned.As time goes by he meets his we, Gillian, at a theological college in England. Today, David lives in Belfast and is only a lay preacher, but also someone who teaches others how to explore and discover the meaning of their lives and with others, how to realise their potential.Out of Africa is available on loan from Downpatrick Library and can also be bought from amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Seals.jpg","title":"Seals prosper in Strangford Lough  ","story":"STRANGFORD Lough is proving to be a popular nursery for grey seals.The largest sea inlet in Ireland can boast having  pups born in its waters during last autumn, the most since records began almost  years ago.The National Trust, which records the number of wildle visiting the area, revealed there were  adults in the lough at the peak of the breeding season last year ndash something of a turnaround for the protected species.In the early s records show that only around six or seven grey seals were born in the area each year.Lead ranger at Strangford Lough Hugh Thurgate say several factors have contributed to the growth in numbers.He said: ldquoThe boom reflects the burgeoning population in Scottish waters which is pushing the population down the North Channel and into the Irish Sea and seals are being forced to seek out new places to breed.ldquoThe shelter of Strangford is a strong draw for seals on the look-out for alternative spots to relax on shore during the breeding and moulting seasons.Mr Thurgate agrees that Strangford Lough is just the place for them.He added: ldquoThe seals are looking for a safe and protected place to raise their young ndash somewhere that provides protection from the elements and is relatively free from disturbance ndash which Strangford Lough offers.ldquoPups are quite vulnerable. Seals give birth on the beach andyou get stormy weather, tidal surges and high spring tides, high pup vitalities can occur because seals are unable to thermo-regulate properly.ldquoSo,you have calmer conditions pups are going to have a better chance of survival.The mild lough islands of Strangford are a favourite spot for the seals to haul out in large groups, known as rockeries, now a regular sight for boat users.Mr Thurgate, who has worked on Strangford Lough for two decades, has seen the population steadily rise.He said: ldquoWe starting counting seals in .

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

He’s been involved in the drinks trade for years, turning his hand to a range of roles, from wine to fizzy water.“It’s a single malt distillery, and the other important part of it is the visitor centre. It’s really our brand home,” Derek told Ulster Business.“It’s about showing off Hinch and showing off Co Down. It allows us to hold events. There is a , sq ft internal courtyard, so we would be able to host - people for an event… our imagination is boundless.“In terms of test distilling, we will start our test around February March and be in production by April or May.”The current Hinch whiskey on the market is coming from a range of sources – already aged. The grain element in the whiskey coming from Great Northern Distillery.“We have tried to look for our niche. In our Time collection, it’s about aged blends. We have our three, five and -year-old sherry finish, a -year-old Amarone which is in the cask already, then finishing up with a -year-old in that range.“Because of the close relationships with the distilleries which have sourced this from, with the grain element we will continue to buy the same grain that was used in those whiskies. We reckon we can pretty much duplicate what we currently have, in the future.“We also have ambitions to launch our signature, single malt range, coming out of the distillery.”As far as output goes, it should be able to produce , litres of pure alcohol, single malt, but that number could soar to two million with extra mash tuns.Derek’s own career has taken him to global food giants such as Unilever, working specically for Batchelors foods, before moving to the then SmithKline Beecham as an account manager.His first move into the alcohol and beverage sector was with wine company Ernest and Julio Gallo where he spent four years. A stint at Ballygowan spring water followed.It’s also due to launch the first of its ‘craft beer’ range. That will see it ageing whiskey in barrels from Irish breweries including Heaney, Kinnegar and Whitewater.And as whiskey takes at least three years to develop, Hinch is also producing a gin – Ninth Wave. According to Derek, they spent around four or five months developing a series of recipes, before deciding on what will now be their own premium gin.It’s also Derek’s penchant for ancient history, dating back to Celtic times, that inspired the gin’s name. It comes from the Celtic form of heaven, ‘the other world’.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
