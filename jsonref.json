Lucian Freud’s etchings bore me senseless, Francis Bacon barely doodled, but Hockney is a graphic master. His retrospective of a life of portrait drawing is the most dazzling display of his art I have ever seen.Forget the rants about smoking, or the personality that has always made him so lovable. Hockney here is not a star but a stare. In self-portraits drawn with a steady black line, he eyeballs himself in the mirror, mercilessly seeing lank hair and a skinny body. He draws his own eyes through the unforgiving lenses of his spectacles. It’s uncomfortable to stand close to those eyes – the sense of Hockney sizing you up is almost oppressive. This series was made in 1983, when he was still blond, but he can see himself getting older. What does the future hold? The intensity of Hockney’s self-inspection, fag in mouth, bears comparison with Rembrandt. When an artist looks so hard into the mirror, we share what they see – we are invited into the undisguised truth.Hockney has been looking into the mirror since he was a teenager. In drawings and a lithograph from the 1950s he scrutinises a serious, sensitive youth in a brown pullover, with brown hair. (He’s already got stylish glasses, though.) These self-portraits done between the ages of 17 and 19 prove Hockney had immense ability before he went to the Royal College of Art. But what makes this exhibition so staggering is the picture it builds of a man who has never stopped learning. The reason drawing suits Hockney is that it lets him test himself. His lack of complacency is what makes him so beguiling.Picasso is his restless teacher. In 1973-4 Hockney portrayed them together in a fantasy scene that emulates Picasso’s Vollard Suite. Pablo sits on one side of a table in a stripy top, while Hockney faces him, nude, to be sketched. His pubic hair fluffs up between his legs. It’s a wonderful dream – to be Picasso’s nude – but Artist and Model could just as well have been called Master and Pupil. Folded curtains and a view of a French street are defined in thin, strong black ink lines in the style of Picasso’s portrait of Igor Stravinsky. It’s very hard to draw as simply as that. Picasso got the manner from Raphael. Hockney has the same confidence. And like Picasso, he plays games. This is the lesson of the master: you need to change style constantly in the search for an elusive truth.Since the 1960s, Hockney has done just that in portraits of three of his closest friends: Celia Birtwell, Gregory Evans and Maurice Payne. Each gets their own generous space. Birtwell’s beauty is recorded with seemingly endless stylistic fun. Sketches from the 1970s depict the textile and fashion designer, who was married to Ossie Clark, looking like a glam dream in swanky dresses and romantic hair, drawn in soft colours. She poses with a cigarette, or lies back in Paris in a slip, her face a mask. Maybe it’s her enigmatic aura that made him draw her so often. Yet she doesn’t hold anything back – Celia, Nude, which dates from 1975, has her look away while she lets Hockney draw her breasts orange and blue.Gregory, too, let Hockney draw him naked in 1975. In Gregory Leaning Nude, he looks like a Florentine youth painted by Botticelli. He rests his slim body against the wall, looking into space from under long tawny locks while Hockney records his pink penis. The following year, he closes his eyes for a lithograph in which he’s wearing just gym socks. But while Hockney can make Evans beautiful, he has also drawn him in states of scary vulnerability. In two studies from 1988 he seems damaged. In a 1999 portrait his hair is mangled and sweaty, his face desperately emaciated. Evans is Hockney’s everyman, undergoing life’s changes, who, in these works of art, experiences extreme highs and lows. A loving study of him asleep adds to the novel of his life.With Payne, the theme is time. In 1967, Hockney drew this handsome man as a dandy. By 1984, he was ageing and meditative. And through the 1990s, Hockney recorded each mark of time, in frank studies of a beautiful man getting on in years.As have they all. In 2019, Hockney brought their portraits up to date for this show. Their latest ink portraits are shown together to intensely haunting effect. It’s like the end of a film where you see the characters as they are now, long after their youthful adventures. Evans is in a tracksuit. Birtwell still has joy in her eyes.Ah, and young David. What has become of him? A video shows his wrinkled hand leafing through an album of sketches from last year in Normandy. Their freshness and variety is staggering as he leaps easily from the most direct observation of wood-framed houses to abstract jeux d’esprit.Wherever he is, you see, Hockney’s true home is his sketchbook. Drawing lets him hold what he loves. A room is given to his acute drawings of his mother, again resembling Rembrandt as he contemplates her in old age. Another set of images show himself to himself on his iPad – smoking and staring, screwing up his face in a caricature of rage.This exhibition reveals, with total freshness, an artist full of curiosity about himself and other people. Hockney rejoices in invention but never loses sight of his simple subject: being alive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfb6291ebe2e1689aee8e638500e894ae3a923da/0_366_1363_817/master/1363.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a60142621e853aefad0cd0eeea30efe9","title":"extreme selfies the photographer who goes out on a limb in pictures minkkinen","story":"Arno Rafael Minkkinen has been using his body as his subject for five decades.

That benefited Sanders once againWho is the happy warrior?Apparently not a single one of the seven Democratic candidates locked in a doom-laden downward spiral in the final debate before Super Tuesday.The last Democrat to win the presidency printed posters with HOPE slapped all over them. Judging from Tuesday’s debate in South Carolina, most of the party’s leading voices are either breathless or hopeless.Yes, the stakes are high, after three years of the presidential dumpster fire called Donald Trump. But the stakes sound even higher if your presidential campaign is also on fire, as it seemed to be for just about everyone on stage.CBS News, the host of the verbal calamity that was Tuesday’s debate, helpfully placed the two least appealing candidates on the outer edges of the stage.It was a very finely balanced contest between billionaire Mike Bloomberg and billionaire Tom Steyer as to who could win the title of the most bizarre combination of arrogance and incompetence.In this live human experiment where we all watch wealthy old men burn their money in TV ads and political consultants, Bloomberg and Steyer could barely cough up their pre-digested punchlines.Bloomberg came out hot for Bernie, turning a question about his favorite subject – the economy – into a convoluted attack about Russian support. It was typical of a candidate who is most often described as data-driven because he is so clearly not human-driven.“Vladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be president of the United States, and that’s why Russia is helping you get elected, so you will lose to him,” said the former New York mayor.“Oh, Mr Bloomberg,” said Sanders. Oh Mr Bloomberg. Somehow his consultants didn’t predict that Sanders would look into the camera, accuse the billionaire of cozying up to China’s dictator, and tell Putin to go away.In contrast it often seemed like Tom Steyer walked on stage without speaking to a single consultant who could tell him the truth about his clunky concoction of a campaign.Steyer has no conceivable rationale for running since his call for impeaching Trump was overtaken by, well, impeachment. So he began by agreeing with the Democratic frontrunner before making a plea to save the private sector.“Bernie Sanders’ analysis is right. The difference is, I don’t like his solutions,” Steyer said. “I don’t believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families. I think what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant, competitive private sector.”Thank goodness there are courageous billionaires like Steyer who speak up for the private sector. If only he didn’t look perpetually terrified by the prospect of remembering his own talking points.Tuesday’s debate was the last best chance for the Sanders-chasers to catch his tail, but they seemed torn between attacking the Vermont senator and attacking each other. It’s hard to stay focused when you’re fighting for your political life.Joe Biden was standing next to Bernie Sanders in the center of the debate stage and the two old men did their best to sound like they were fighting over the last free seat on the subway.“You know, when we talk about progressive, let’s talk about being progressive,” Biden began, before freestyling with English grammar to create a mosaic of half-thoughts, swipes and slights.“Being progressive, he thought Barack Obama – he wanted a primary – he said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should, and, in fact, the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it. Look, folks, this is – let’s talk about progressive. Progressive is getting things done, and that’s what we got done. We got a lot done.”The only debaters who got anything done on stage on Tuesday were Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar. But they both struggled to make the case for their own campaigns as well as they destroyed the case for their rivals.Warren said she agreed with Sanders “on a lot of things” but would just do a better job because she worked harder than he did. “Getting a progressive agenda enacted is going to be really hard,” she said, “and it’s going to take someone who digs into the details to make it happen.”It’s not exactly a killer argument at this late stage of the primaries, but Warren is clearly capable of crafting one of those. Once she turned to Bloomberg, Warren displayed the kind of search-and-destroy debating skills that turns businessmen into Big Gulps.After pointing out all of his donations to Trump allies in Congress, including South Carolina’s own Lindsey Graham, Warren said, “I don’t care how much money Mayor Bloomberg has. The core of the Democratic party will never trust him. He has not earned their trust. I will. And the fact that he cannot earn the trust of core of the Democratic party means he is the riskiest candidate standing on this stage.”There was a time, briefly, when the moderates – Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg – ganged up on the massive spending plans that Sanders has placed at the heart of his campaign. “A bunch of broken promises that sound good on bumper stickers,” said Klobuchar.But that was after she talked about working with Sanders to bring down drug prices and promoted her own “more affordable, nonprofit public option”. Given the choice between Sanders and Sanders-lite, Democratic voters might just go for the option that fits on a bumper sticker.Mayor Pete made a solid, regular case for just about every solid, regular subject. If this were a contest in sounding reasonable, then Buttigieg would run away with the contest. But the metronomic mayor regulates his beat a little too precisely to have a true pulse.“If you think the last four years has been chaotic, isive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders vs Donald Trump. Folks at home, from South Carolina to South Bend, are trying to figure out what any of this means for us,” he explained with a turn of phrase that was delivered just like it was written for him. All folksy and southy.Yes, he admitted, there was a progressive majority. “But, also, there’s a majority of the American people who I think right now just want to be able to turn on the TV, see their president, and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit, instead of up through the roof.”It takes a peculiar love of reason to think you can campaign against passion by pushing for lower blood pressure. Don’t get too excited now.As Bernie Sanders glided past the punches and counterpunches, Joe Biden stood center stage lamenting the state of the debate.“I guess the only way you do this is jump in and speak twice as long as you should,” said the former vice-president, sounding like he was just about getting a hang of this debate thing on the teevee.“Why am I stopping?” he asked mid-sentence, a little later, as his time ran out. “Nobody else stops.”How true. Nobody in this race is stopping even though Sanders has already passed them by.At least Bernie knows why he’s running. Most of the rest of them are like Joe Biden: they just think it’s their turn to talk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2814d265a6288939c2a6c2660cb6b21d1b02567/0_116_3486_2093/master/3486.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=174b6d25e033b8967646e1a857980d73","title":"democratic debate vitriol light substance","story":"Instead of an informed discussion, voters were treated to a bad-faith fiasco in the service of narcissism, dishonesty and petty grievanceFor reasons that remain unclear, there was yet another Democratic primary debate on Tuesday night, the 10th such event of the presidential contest. The seven candidates who qualified convened in Charleston, South Carolina, ahead of the South Carolina primary on Saturday and the slew of Super Tuesday contests next week. It will not be the last debate that we are subjected to – yet another is scheduled for 15 March. Tuesday’s debate, hosted by CBS, was mercifully short compared to some others, wrapping up after just two hours. For my sins, I watched the whole thing.Perhaps because there have been so many of these debates, the candidates seemed determined to make it dramatic television. At times, they seemed to be vying for ratings. Much of the evening was spent in shouting and cross talk. Biden pointed Sanders threw his hands in the air in exasperation Bloomberg delivered practiced jokes he had paid someone to write for him, exuding all the charisma of a rubber chicken. Everyone had grievances everyone had accusations and recriminations to make against the others. Not that you could hear them: the shouting often made it hard to make out just quite what anyone was saying. The event was heavy on vitriol and light on substance.Faint overtures toward civility were made. Joe Biden complained frequently that other candidates did not respect the response time limits, and used much of his own time to suggest that he might take extra time himself. The billionaire Michael Bloomberg, in an attempt to extoll the virtues of centrism, made an odd Freudian slip when referring to the wave of Democrats elected to the House in the 2018 midterms. “All those new Democrats who came in and put Nancy Pelosi in power, I bought –\u0026nbspI got ‘em,” he said.Others urged unity. “If we spend the next four months tearing our party apart,” warned Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, “We’re going to spend the next four years tearing our country apart.” This sentiment did not stop her from attacking her rivals, however: she quickly complained that Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts had not been sufficiently productive in the Senate.Perhaps the only person on stage who did not spend much of her speaking time yelling was Senator Warren, who remained composed and calm while the men around her screamed and grew petulant under pressure. But the chaos of Tuesday’s debate may have been partially a punishment for Senator Warren’s success in the previous debate last week, in Nevada, when she devastatingly attacked former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.Warren’s attacks were a boon to her candidacy: she raised a tremendous amount of money during and just after the debate, and the polling numbers of Bloomberg, her ideological enemy and a significant Super Tuesday threat, dropped like a lead balloon after she was done with him. The event catapulted her to number two in a national poll, and demonstrated her ability to handily skewer an arrogant billionaire. But the events of last week’s debate seems to have cursed this week’s: every candidate wanted a Warren moment, but not every candidate is Elizabeth Warren. The result was a lot of attacks directed at Bloomberg and Sanders from other candidates that lacked the intelligence and moral certainty of Warren’s skewering of Bloomberg last week.The moderators did not help. Some of the questions were phrased in what seemed like deliberate bad faith, such as when they suggested, absurdly, that Bernie Sanders was sympathetic to authoritarianism. Other questions were pointless softballs that elicited no meaningful information from the candidates, such as a concluding prompt directed at all the candidates, asking them to state their personal motto and to correct one misconception about themselves. To this, former vice-president Joe Biden replied, “I have more hair than I think I do.” It is quite possible that viewers who watched the debate ended it with less information than when they began.The 10th Democratic debate, then, was less an informed discussion of the issues in the service of better informing the electorate than it was a bad-faith fiasco in the service of narcissism, dishonesty, and petty grievance. The event was so heavy on theatrics and so light on policy substance that it calls into question the usefulness of the broadcasts at all. The Tuesday debate did not benefit the republic, and may have actively hurt it. The events, repeated ad nauseam with few variations and little new information, seem to benefit no one except the networks that air them. They are designed less to facilitate meaningful debates on policy issues than to manufacture conflict and stoke voters’ contempt.Perhaps the only moment of the night that seemed to have more to do with principle than pageantry was an exchange between Bloomberg and Warren, when Bloomberg objected to Warren’s characterization of the accusations of sexual harassment and pregnancy discrimination. Warren, speaking about her own experience of pregnancy discrimination when she was a public school teacher in her early twenties, brought up an accusation from a former employee of Bloomberg’s, who claims that when she told Bloomberg she was pregnant, he instructed her to “kill it”. Bloomberg denied that he ever said this he asked Warren what evidence she had. Warren responded that her evidence was the woman’s own account. In fact, a third party witness also corroborated that Bloomberg did say this, but Warren’s answer that her evidence was the woman’s own words upheld an important principle: that in matters of sexism and sex discrimination claims, women’s testimony is evidence. It was that rarest of moments: a candidate on the debate stage saying something that mattered.In response, Bloomberg threw up his hands. Later, after a similar exchange at the last debate, he said, he had already consented to release three women from their nondisclosure agreements, and his company would no longer use NDAs to silence sex discrimination claimants. What more did Warren want? It probably made the world a better place, Bloomberg conceded. And this, too, was a rare achievement for a Democratic debate: it achieved something positive for actual Americans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b50f22b0e2a38268c7fe0effbcdbc35a543cb420/0_347_5313_3188/master/5313.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be1f9bff33761ca1b478ae4afaff1cd5","title":"germany angela merkel cdu","story":"The chancellor has honed the CDU’s appeal to a wide range of voters – but suddenly the future of her party is in doubtA political coup in any German state would make for a countrywide political frenzy. But the ousting of the popular Ramelow this month by the Christian Democrats (CDU) and Liberals (FDP), acting in concert with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), was particularly galling. With a margin of only one vote, they removed Ramelow as minister-president and replaced him with an obscure West German liberal, Thomas Kemmerich, whose party has a minuscule five seats in the Thuringian parliament. In a country that prides itself on honouring political taboos, the apparent coordination between conservatives and the AfD cut through the cordon sanitaire that has long forbidden mainstream parties from working with the far right. It didn’t help that the Thuringian AfD brand is home to the most outspoken white nationalist in German politics, Björn Höcke, who greeted Kemmerich in a scene that political pundits compared to Paul von Hindenburg shaking hands with Hitler almost 100 years earlier, nor that their machinations were closely followed by a shooting involving a rightwing fanatic.When Ramelow first took office, in 2014, there were protests on the streets of the Thuringian capital, Erfurt, against his “Stalinism”. But in the following years, support for him deepened. Ramelow, who had strong union credentials, was descended from a long line of Protestant ministers in West Germany, and was adept at forging alliances. The backbone of his anti-fascist firewall came from Communist voters for the East German SED (Socialist Unity) party, but he had expanded his appeal well beyond.Like a shrewd leftwing pastor, he delivered popular policies to his flock: expanding state-funded childcare, hiring more teachers and providing more subsidies for students. He has hired more police, but also abolished local branches of the German intelligence services, known for their rightwing sympathies. His endearingly gruff manner on TV won him fans across Germany, and he wisely avoided the factional struggles inside his party. One of first acts in office was to apologise for crimes committed by the Communist East German state. When his rightwing critics demanded that he go further and declare the East German Communist state an Unrechtsstaat, Ramelow drew a line in the sand. He made a rigorous case for why he would not be using the same definition for the German Democratic Republic that the German Jewish judge Fritz Bauer at the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials had applied to Nazi state.The plot to unseat Ramelow in Thuringia was embarrassing for Chancellor Merkel. She appeared to have temporarily lost control of a local branch of her party, and her designated replacement for the chancellorship, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, nominal secretary of the CDU, promptly resigned in the wake of the chaos. Merkel and the FDP’s head, Christian Lindner, will succeed in reversing the result of the election and disciplining their rogue members. More interesting is the message that the local Thuringian CDU wanted to send back to Berlin. For years the branch has looked with envy at Austria, where the conservative chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, was able to form a strong coalition with the far-right Freedom party in 2017. As it was in the 20th century, Austria remains a critical laboratory for rightwing gene-splicing. The Thuringian CDU wanted to show Berlin that it has options on the menu besides coalitions with Social Democrats or the Greens, and to protest against what the party sees as the inevitable future of “system Merkel”.What is this future? Having shifted the centre of German politics well to the left of where the CDU was before her, Merkel has progressively absorbed elements of her coalition partners’ platforms. The Social Democrats have been bled dry, and the party is virtually indistinguishable from Merkel’s own. In search of a new partner, Merkel appears to have selected the Green party as a suitable candidate for CDU coalition. She has prepared the CDU well for the alignment, and adopted parts of the Greens’ environmental agenda. She will be leaving behind a party that is carefully calibrated to capture the median German voter, however much this pares away the distinctive features of the CDU.More than other major parties in the west, Germany’s political centre has redoubled its commitment to militant liberalism. After a decade of political rupture – the financial crisis, anti-austerity movements and the growth of the far-right in European member states – its belief in the longevity of free-trade globalisation, the eurozone, liberal political norms and fiscal austerity remains unshakable. It has long been fashionable to declare that Germany has resisted the type of political implosions seen in France, where Macron’s En Marche has arisen from the rubble of decimated parties. But Merkel has quietly been assembling what amounts to a new party. Her CDU barely resembles the conservative party of its predecessors. It has become so vague and expansive that it can simultaneously attract German professionals, immigrants and xenophobic farmers.Some of Merkel’s fiercest detractors from within her own party, such as Wolfgang Schäuble and Friedrich Merz, want the CDU to return to its former, conservative principles. Merz is the sort of CDU man who in 1997 voted against the criminalisation of marital rape. Schäuble would even be content to run a minority government – until recently an unimaginable horror for Germany’s political class – if it meant safeguarding his reactionary principles.But if the post-Merkel power struggle is won by one of her antagonists, such as Merz, the CDU’s wide appeal and flexibility would be greatly reduced. The war for its future is between social conservatives focused on the domestic economy, who are tired of making compromises with the left and want a throwback like Merz, and Merkel loyalists with the big German cities and giant export markets in their sights, who want to maintain the well-oiled status quo.• Thomas Meaney is a historian and writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06419de9426f9f9a3d9fe11d24f5ab14391d45b2/0_165_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=511c42ed55f9c65b9831237b1c5f6aa0","title":"toxic sofa eu red tape flame retardants","story":"The use of banned flame retardants is widespread, yet our prime minister is hostile towards public protectionsEverything gets buried by Brexit – that, after all, is the point. It’s the great disrupter and the great distractor. Under the cover of chaos, essential public protections are destroyed.Take the scandal that should be creating headlines everywhere: the toxic flame retardants now penetrating the lives of everyone in the UK. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, that – as far as government and industry are concerned – is job done.Every night, millions of children and adults sleep on mattresses treated with a class of chemicals that was long ago banned from sheepdips and pesticides. Every day, we sit on furniture containing the same toxic compounds, absorbing them through our lungs and skin. According to parliament’s environmental audit committee (EAC), mothers in the UK and the US have the world’s highest recorded concentrations of a toxic class of flame retardants in their breastmilk. Banned fire retardants have recently been discovered in umbilical cord blood. We have no clear idea of how they might affect the development and future health of foetuses. But we know that they are persistent, accumulative and associated with cancer and disruption of the hormonal and reproductive systems.Until 2016, when he blew the whistle on spectacular malpractice within government, Terry Edge was the lead civil servant working on fire safety regulations for furniture. His research shows that, owing to decades of industry lobbying, homes in the UK have the world’s highest levels of dangerous flame retardants. It took until last year for mattresses and furniture containing the highly toxic retardant deca-BDE to be banned, under European law, from sale. Instead of prohibiting all such dangerous, persistent organic chemicals in furniture, the UK government has allowed one hazardous pollutant to be replaced by others (TCEP, TCPP and TDCP).Even when such furnishings are removed from our homes, the hazard persists, as – in defiance of the Stockholm convention the UK has signed – they are still dumped in landfill or burned in incinerators at temperatures too low to destroy the toxic chemicals they release. Scarcely monitored, with unknown effects, these poisons steadily seep across the nation.To make matters worse, far from saving us from fires, flame retardants appear to increase the risk. This is because the furniture containing them produces poisonous byproducts when it smoulders, including hydrogen cyanide, dioxins and furans. Since the 1990s, most of the deaths and injuries inflicted by fires in the UK have been caused not from burns but by inhaling toxic smoke. Edge contends that many of the deaths at Grenfell Tower were likely to have been caused by toxic emissions from furnishings but, as a result of the influence of industrial lobbyists, this cause has not been properly considered in the inquiry. A paper in the journal Chemosphere shows that furniture made from tightly woven natural fabrics is no more flammable than furniture treated with flame retardants, and produces far less toxic gas.But using flame retardants is cheaper. The rules on how furniture and mattress manufacturers meet government standards are poorly worded and have gone unreformed since 1988. They allow manufacturers to simply slap these chemicals on their products, rather than use other, less flammable methods. Some companies want the regulations changed so they can make safer products and still compete on price. Others are determined to keep using flame retardants despite the dangers. As usual, the government has sided with the careless operators against the responsible ones.After the EAC published its report last summer, and the media finally began to take an interest, it looked as if all this might change. But then the issue, like so many others, was bulldozed by Brexit. It has disappeared into what looks like total regulatory chaos. In November a House of Lords inquiry asked a series of questions that the government was unable to answer properly. Nor has it yet been able to respond to a similar set of questions I put to it this week.How will synthetic chemicals be regulated in this country after Brexit? Will the UK simply adopt the European system? If so, how will it obtain the information on which EU risk assessment is based? If it doesn’t have this data, how can the government fend off legal challenges from companies seeking to use dangerous substances? Alternatively, will the UK create a system of its own? If so, where is it? Or will this country become a deregulated zone, a dumping ground for chemicals that can’t be sold in the EU?If we know anything about this government, it’s that it will find a way accidentally to lose our public protections down the back of the toxic sofa during the turmoil of transition. Already we have seen how the government’s environment, agriculture and fisheries bills seek to replace European rules protecting the natural world with vague promises, financial incentives and handwaving. The government’s new “red tape challenge” suggests it has learned nothing from the way in which similar deregulatory schemes contributed to the Grenfell disaster and other gross failures. Even before we erge from European standards, under Boris Johnson’s misrule the UK is becoming one of the world’s worst financial secrecy regimes, as the City of London, correctly reading the political signals, provides an ever warmer welcome to tax avoiders and money launderers.As Donald Trump has done in the US, Johnson will do to the UK: trading our health and wellbeing for favours to his supporters. Under the cover of chaos, released from European oversight, corporate power accumulates like a persistent toxin in the bloodstream of the nation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e239a2c90fa1259a7b261afa1903462090987682/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4aace71e51e6dc2b8b49766e9f12404","title":"bohai bay the chinese region disappearing inch by inch in pictures","story":"Farmland, abandoned seaside resorts and salt fields are slowly being claimed by the rising waters, with 100 million people predicted to be affected in China by 2050All photographs by Sean Gallagher for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/165c44900bb5317fd698b3f60eb686d223cb02b5/0_29_8333_5003/master/8333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ee6d5ff95aae12f7976dbf6f1db19dd","title":"pump up the volume why massive sleeves are this years biggest trend","story":"Unmissable sleeves – with their ruffles, puffs and frills – are ballooning across the catwalk and the high street. And there’s no sign of the trend deflatingOversized sleeves shouldn’t be a viable trend. They come stuffed with social and logistical questions. Such as: is it possible to hug those you love while wearing a top that resembles giant arm bands? And: how can you possibly squeeze a pair of huge sleeves into the arms of your coat? (Answers: no and you can’t.) And yet the big sleevification of fashion is in full swing regardless.Last week’s Milan catwalks were full of sleeves the diameter of dinner plates. Elongated puffs of fabric covered the arms, like the trunk of a squid, at Fendi. At MaxMara, dresses came with drop-shouldered puff sleeves and bomber jackets with multilayered frills that recalled sea anemones.There were elbow-grazing accordion sleeves on black jumpsuits and giant batwings on beige macintoshes at Bottega Veneta. At Sportmax, a shirt with pie-crust collar came with extended, pointed shoulders that ruffled down the upper arm like angel wings.There were eccentric scenes at London fashion week, where Shrimps and Regino Pyo did leg-of-mutton chic while the shadow self of Lady Diana’s wedding dress appeared on the Richard Quinn catwalk.This is not just a runway trend, however. If anything, it came from the internet and the high street first. Instagram-savvy brands such as Ganni have made puff sleeves happen for a couple of years. Zara’s puff-sleeved creations, meanwhile – such as the sell-out £60 top with bubblegum pink sleeves as buoyant as airbags, now on eBay for about £80 – owned party season. This year’s awards-season red carpets were puff-tastic, too, with Beyoncé, Sandra Oh and Florence Pugh partaking in the big sleeve-off.That brands are still banking on what might at first have looked like a flash-in-the-pan trend, for autumnwinter 2020, with their Milan fashion week incarnation in coats even negating some of the practical challenges, suggests that giant sleeves might go the distance.Elizabeth I was an epic sleeve-wearer, too, and Tudor sleeves were often “padded with horse hair to hold the shape in a very specific way,” says Butchart. In the “Ditchley” portrait, for example, Elizabeth I’s golden sleeves “scream status,” says Butchart. “Everything about that says: ‘I’m the most important woman in the country.’”Outerwear issues aside, Mair believes they can be inclusive and practical. Elephantine sleeves make insecurities about biceps and triceps irrelevant, and can create an exaggerated hourglass silhouette because proportionally they “make the other aspects of the body look smaller”. While flattering, they are not about the male gaze, Butchart adds, because they do not present “obvious sexual signifiers”.Even more thriftily, says Mair, adding a ruffle, or a puff, at the sleeve, can also be a way of adapting an existing garment: “a good way of using resources and making them very current”. The Colville presentation at Milan fashion week proved this point: the label showed puffy sleeves, like a bolero’s, upcycled from vintage 80s shell suits and yellow puffa jackets from the 90s. The sleeves, says the Colville co-founder Lucinda Chambers, “create a new silhouette that is cool and inidual” and could be layered over other pieces.Wearing a big sleeve, says Mair, also signifies your allegiance to a tribe. “Everybody wants to belong – and most people who are interested in fashion want to be fashionable. There are so many variations that you can stand out as well as belong, which is what fashion always wants us to do,” she says.Certainly, the big sleeve is a statement – and not one that everyone will want to make. But it is big – and it’s getting bigger. This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Wearing one now can feel like a coded message• Read more from the springsummer 2020 edition of The Fashion, our biannual style supplementI can tell the time. Honestly, the big hand, etc, the little hand and so on. I can definitely, absolutely tell the time, but a moment came, around 20 years ago, when I realised… I no longer had to.One side-effect of the rise of mobile phones was that clocks became decorative and watches irrelevant. As years passed, and my own life transitioned from blood and air to thumb and screen, the need for their very existence became questionable. If I needed to tell the time, I would glance to the top of whichever piece of glass I was using and in the small cracks in between, the shallow minutes when I was walking from one screen to the next, well, I could wing it, perhaps by measuring the angle of the sun.Yet as the need for watches has waned, the passion for them has remained. And, in certain circles, it soars. The author Gary Shteyngart detailed his obsessive love of watches in a New Yorker essay published in 2017, shortly after Donald Trump had been elected president. “In a society hopeless and cruel,” he explained, “the particular and the microscopic were the only things that could still prove reliable.”“A watch was merely a watch,” until mobile phones arrived, says Bill Prince, editor of GQ Watch And Jewellery, “whereupon it was assigned many more attributes, not least the ability to define the wearer’s taste and social standing.” For men, hard-to-find vintage models by Rolex, Audemars Piguet and Patek Philippe have become “the nearest a man can get to owning an It bag – and occupy the same role: confirmation that he is someone who understands current trends, and has the resources to do so.” At Browns, sales of MAD Paris watches (reworked Rolex, Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet models) average at one a week – the most recent sold for £125k.In those first cautious days, my watch felt too heavy with meaning. I was horribly aware that strangers might have me for someone attempting a “digital detox” or some similarly tortured performance of superiority. And yet, as I became accustomed to carrying time, it became… handy. I found myself managing my day more efficiently – a morning broke cleanly into a number of parts, rather than simply post-breakfast and pre-lunch. While in previous eras a watch was the final accessory to a conservative, correct outfit, in today’s world half-lived online, I started to appreciate the way it released me, gently, from my phone. I can’t be the only person who, after lighting up its screen to find out the time, will look up 40 minutes later, having scrolled through the entirety of Instagram and half of the news, dazed, thirsty and with a metallic taste in my mouth a little like blood.Say I were to embrace the analogue watch, and upgrade to something grand and vintage that tells others I’m an adult to be reckoned with, where would I start? Vintage watch expert Helmut Crott warns newcomers to be wary. “Anybody who does not have a trustworthy and knowledgable consultant should probably not buy a vintage watch,” he says.OK. Fine. But what if I want one? What then?“I’d recommend you touch the watch instead of buying online, and buy in major auction houses,” Prince agrees. “Buying at a reputable auction house is important (Fellows in Birmingham and the big three, Christie’s, Sotheby’s, Phillips) where watches will have been examined for authenticity and evidence of tampering. Otherwise, it’s important to consider provenance and wear, as they will affect values long term.”Should I? Could I? Shteyngart’s words ring in my ear as I gaze at the second hand, and consider the microscopic ways it has helped slow my life down. That night, unable to sleep, I find myself scrolling watches on eBay. In this new ticking world, phones, you see, still have their place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b6e51e5f8dcf57d63c90cd3a3e9ca7daa658572/0_115_3227_1937/master/3227.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8741b7c1e9a4b60c5c2dcad09a685a1c","title":"napoli barcelona champions league last 16 first leg match report","story":"Antoine Griezmann’s equaliser cancelled out a fine opener from Napoli’s Dries Mertens to give Barcelona a 1-1 draw and the upper hand in their Champions League last-16 tie.Mertens had made the most of the Italian club’s solid start to curl home an effort after 30 minutes. However, after the midfielder was forced off with injury following a heavy challenge from Sergio Busquets, Barcelona drew level when Griezmann lashed the ball in from close range.Barça finished with 10 men after Arturo Vidal was shown two quick yellow cards for a tackle on Mário Rui and then pushing his head into the face of the Napoli man during the closing stages.“It’s a positive result for us overall,” said the Barcelona coach, Quique Setien. “We controlled most of the game, but we lacked something in the final third against such an organised defence by Napoli.“After the equaliser, they opened up a little and we were able to hurt them more. They played very well and it was not easy, so a score draw is fine going into the second leg.”Lionel Messi, who scored four goals in the 5-0 win over Eibar which put Barcelona top of LaLiga, sent an early chance over before Napoli made a breakaway count as Mertens swept them in front. Piot Zielinski won possession from Junior Firpo and charged down the right before cutting the ball across the edge of the Barcelona area, Mertens took a touch before curling a wonderful finish over a static Marc André ter Stegen and into the top corner – a goal which made the Belgian Napoli’s joint record scorer, level on 121 goals with Marek Hamsik.Barcelona looked for a swift response before half-time but failed to stretch the home defence or test the goalkeeper David Ospina. The Partenopei could have been further ahead after 42 minutes when a free-kick was only partial cleared, Fabian Ruiz fed Jose Callejon and his cross was fired just wide by centre-back Kostas Manolas.They came out with more intensity at the start of the second half, too. Busquets caught Mertens with a high tackle which led to a yellow card and the Belgian eventually hobbled off, to be replaced by Arkadiusz Milik in the 54th minute.Napoli continued to be pushed back by Barcelona’s press and Griezmann equalised after 57 minutes. Nélson Semedo beat the offside trap from Busquets’ pass when he darted into the right side of the area and crossed for the French World Cup winner to smash the ball in from close range.Napoli, who finished second in Group E behind Liverpool, soon threatened again. Their captain, Lorenzo Insigne, weaved his way into the left of the Barça area and forced Ter Stegen into a low save. The German was alert again to come off his line and block from Callejon. At the other end Messi looked to get on the end of an exchange with Vidal and collided with Ospina as the Napoli keeper made a brave save, which saw both players need treatment.Samuel Umtiti headed over a corner from Messi before Vidal saw red, meaning he will be suspended for the return at the Camp Nou next month. The Barça defender Gerard Piqué also limped off during stoppage time with what looked like an ankle problem.Napoli’s coach Gennaro Gattuso felt his side had missed an opportunity to give themselves more of a foothold in the tie. “Barcelona struggled because we were very careful.

Guardiola felt that Raheem Sterling should have had a penalty in the second half of the first leg at Anfield, which ended in a 3-0 Liverpool win, while he lost his composure in the return and was sent off after Leroy Sané had a goal disallowed for offside. That would have made it 3-2 on aggregate and City fell apart thereafter.Guardiola’s team threw away a lead to exit on away goals to Monaco in the last 16 in 2016-17 – his first season at the club – and were also aggrieved to go out to Tottenham in last season’s quarter-final. Sergio Agüero missed a penalty in the first leg in London while Spurs’s winner in the return appeared to go in off Fernando Llorente’s hand. Then there was the last-gasp VAR drama when an apparent Sterling winner was ruled out for an offside against Agüero.Guardiola made the point that City needed to play to their strengths, first and foremost, against Real, the 13-times champions, but he agreed that better luck might also be a factor.Guardiola, who said Sterling was fit after hamstring trouble, restated his belief that City would have their ban overturned by the court of arbitration for sport and be able to compete in next season’s Champions League. “I trust the people in my club, they have showed me the arguments and the proof, and we are optimistic,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0af2bc61f6b4703bd38c28ed764b612ba0b86097/0_26_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=688c2f8b9dacfe5297f6b38830816d03","title":"oh heck when politicians become unwanted brand ambassadors","story":"Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak are just the latest politicians to cause serious embarrassment with their unsolicited supportIf the perplexed social media team at Yorkshire Tea who spent much of their weekend responding to criticism that they make “Tory tea” after the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, posed making a cup, they can look for sympathy to their fellow brand managers – who have often been caught in the maelstrom of an unwelcome political endorsement.The most common controversies are those involving musicians, who are often allergic to the idea that a politician they detest might use their songs. REM’s bassist, Mike Mills, tweeted earlier this year that the band were exploring legal action to prevent the US president, Donald Trump, from using their music at his rallies and calling him a fraud and a conman.Johnny Marr went further – and, after hearing that David Cameron was a fan, tweeted to the then PM that he was forbidden to like The Smiths any more.But it’s not just artists who have to deal with the fallout of a political endorsement. This time last year, the newly formed Independent Group for Change had a launch lunch in Nando’s. A photo of the group’s first outing was tweeted by Chuka Umunna to much furore on Twitter, and enthusiastic criticism of the politicians’ food choices.Gavin Shuker, who was the MP for Luton South from 2010 to 2019, also tweeted about the meal out, writing: “Hacks struggling for an angle on how best to report the kremlinology of the group be aware I kept a list of medium, lemon and herb, extra hot and my DMs are open.”Matt Navarra, a social media industry commentator, said there are people who make careers from being hated and offering polarising views.“For brands you have to be careful around things like, would it be seen to be leveraging a situation that is quite serious and maybe has negative implications, is that a good thing? Also being aware about the level of audiences for that person and what responding or engaging may lead to,” he said.Navarra added that engaging with someone who has quite aggressive followers could lead to a “a headache as they may bring an army of trolls with them”.For politicians, using brands can be a good strategy as it feels more familiar and colloquial, Navarra said. He flags the case of Labour and KFC, when the Conservatives tweeted the chicken brand saying: “Hey @KFC_UKI, we’ve found an even bigger chicken than you,” attaching an image of Corbyn in a chicken suit to KFC. The food brand, however, was not having any of it, with a quick retort.“KFC came off better than politicians but for them it also brought them into the centre for people’s minds around that topic,” Navarra said.The phenomenon with politicians can also happen in reverse – when a brand thinks they’ve done a great bit of advertising, then realise it may have backfired badly. That happened to Heck sausages during the 2019 Conservative leadership election campaign, when it must have seemed like a publicity coup to have the potential future prime minister visit its sausage factory en route to leadership hustings in York.As well as the usual pictures on the factory floor, Heck had produced some specially branded “Boris bangers” in a packet complete with branding and a distinctive shock of blond hair. The backlash was immediate. #BoycottHeck began trending on social media and the company was enveloped in a full-blown PR crisis – ultimately issuing a statement to clarify that the company had no political affiliation “and didn’t mean to cause offence or upset anyone”. If only the chancellor had been around to offer them a soothing brew."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82ec7cc543fa803cde416b586ac039cf9eead6a4/0_57_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=754ec7244d9f5063ed8030bd5cf53d6f","title":"manchester city following the money","story":"Manchester City’s fortunes changed dramatically with the takeover by Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi.

We just want the same,” a No 10 spokesman said.The EU’s mandate stated that any future relationship with the UK should be “underpinned by robust commitments to ensure a level playing field for open and fair competition, given the EU and the UK’s geographic proximity and economic interdependence”. This accords with the political declaration signed by both parties when Brexit took place.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, also unveiled a compromise position on regulation that falls short of requiring the UK to follow all EU rules in future.The offer involves Brussels retaining the right to apply tariffs or other sanctions if any ergence between the two sides over time leads to “disruptions of the equal condition of competition”, with EU law being the “reference point”.However, Downing Street reacted negatively to the suggestion and claimed it did not recognise the need for a “level playing field” between the UK and EU at all, in spite of the goals of the political declaration.“Level playing field is an EU construct, not a piece of terminology which we use,” Boris Johnson’s official spokesman said.“We have been very clear on our commitment to discuss open and fair competition as part of negotiations, but we will not accept any demands for the UK to follow EU rules, just as we would not expect the EU to accept UK laws.”Johnson’s spokesman also accused the EU of reneging on the political declaration by not sticking to its timetable governing talks on financial services and data adequacy.The first four days of talks are due to start on Monday, with fresh rounds every couple of weeks alternating in location between London and Brussels. The two sides expect 10 rounds of four days, taking the total time set aside to about 40 days before the autumn.Britain is to set out its own negotiating mandate on Thursday. But with the UK effectively threatening to walk away if Brussels insists on sticking to the same rulebook and legal oversight by European courts, Barnier told reporters on Tuesday the EU would “not conclude an agreement at any price”.He warned that if there was to be any chance of a deal by the end of the year, there could be no “backtracking” by the UK on past commitments made in the withdrawal agreement and the accompanying political declaration.“If we want to build up a future relationship in the long term based on trust with the UK, we need to make sure that we have trust in the short term,” he said.“This is predicated on the proper implementation of the withdrawal agreement that has already been signed and ratified. If you read the political declaration that was signed by Boris Johnson, that was negotiated by him and his team, we are not that far apart. In the political declaration every single word counts.”He added: “If we want to succeed in the very short period of time that Mr Johnson has chosen, we need to make sure that we don’t start backtracking where we should be making progress.”Barnier warned that negotiations would be “difficult, perhaps even very difficult” but pointed to the successful negotiation of the withdrawal agreement as a sign that the two sides could end up coming to a deal.“If you look at the discussion with the UK a couple of years ago on the financial settlement, there were many issues that were controversial,” he said.Downing Street said the UK would “engage constructively” but Johnson’s No 10 has put less emphasis on achieving a deal than under Theresa May’s administration.A senior government source said the whole point of Brexit was freeing the UK to make its own laws and “you either get the whole point of Brexit or you don’t”. The source also firmly rejected the idea of allowing any new infrastructure to be built to facilitate any trade checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.The main sources of tension in the negotiation will be how far the UK follows the EU’s rulebook and whether the European Court of Justice has any oversight affecting the UK.However, there is also likely to be disagreement over fishing rights. Brussels’ negotiating mandate demands that the UK continues to allow EU fishing fleets access to British waters, but Britain wants a separate annual agreement on access and quotas.Another disputed clause in the mandate is the EU’s demand that the UK maintains a ban on chlorinated chicken to protects European meat exports but this would creates a potential obstacle to the UK striking a deal with Donald Trump.On the recommendation of France, a clause was inserted to insist that both sides maintain “health and product sanitary quality in the food and agriculture sector”.The paragraph called “Environment and Health” provides a catch-all insurance for the EU that certain methods of food production – including particular pesticides, endocrine disrupters and chlorine washes for poultry – will not be used in the UK.At the weekend, George Eustice, the new UK environment secretary, refused to guarantee that the government would not allow the importation of chlorine-washed chicken as part of a trade deal with the US.The EU’s position was backed by the National Farmers’ Union, whose president, Minette Batters, said it would be “morally bankrupt” and “insane” of Johnson to drop the UK’s high farming and food standards in order to strike a US deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46fc60b6beacf4f5fb4429ce7713a31d690b75b9/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f227bcbd690fc76eab2f302ad2ac880","title":"westminster secret passageway discovery reveals 169 year old graffiti","story":"Route into parliament blocked off in 19th century by Chartist stonemason ‘who was very fond of Ould Ale’A secret passageway discovered in the Palace of Westminster has revealed 169-year-old graffiti from early Chartist stone masons and bricklayers claiming to be fond of “ould ale”.The route into Westminster Hall was built especially for the procession to the coronation banquet of Charles II in the 17th century and was used afterwards to access parliament by political luminaries such as the first prime minister of Great Britain, Robert Walpole, and William Pitt the younger.It was bricked up and the entrance was later hidden and forgotten about, and sometime after the second world war covered by wooden panelling.  During the ongoing restoration work of the Houses of Parliament the passage was rediscovered, as was a memento left by one of the men who helped block it with bricks.In pencil, he had written: “This room was enclosed by Tom Porter who was very fond of Ould Ale.”Historians have worked out that he appears to have been joined in his celebration of enclosing the passage by stonemasons employed by architect Sir Charles Barry, who rebuilt the Palace of Westminster after the devastating fire of 1834.The Real Democrats were part of the working class male suffrage Chartist movement, which called for reforms to allow every man aged 21 to have a vote, and for would-be MPs to stand even if they did not have property.The 1851 census return shows the stone masons were Richard Condon, James Williams, Henry Terry, Thomas Parker and Peter Dewal.The House of Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who was the first senior member of the Commons to visit the find, said: “To think that this walkway has been used by so many important people over the centuries is incredible.“I am so proud of our staff for making this discovery and I really hope this space is celebrated for what it is: a part of our parliamentary history.”Mark Collins, Parliament’s estates historian, said he and his colleagues had been on a high ever since the discovery.“To say we were surprised is an understatement – we really thought it had been walled-up forever after the war,” he said.Liz Hallam Smith, the team’s historical consultant from the University of York, said: “We were trawling through 10,000 uncatalogued documents relating to the palace at the Historic England archives in Swindon, when we found plans for the doorway in the cloister behind Westminster Hall.“As we looked at the panelling closely, we realised there was a tiny brass keyhole that no-one had really noticed before, believing it might just be an electricity cupboard.“Once a key was made for it, the panelling opened up like a door into this secret entrance.”In the passageway they discovered the original hinges for two wooden doors 3.5 metres high that would have opened into Westminster Hall – but also the graffiti from the workers.“It’s quite incredible how this writing has survived and can be read so easily, despite having been scribbled in pencil,” said Dr Collins.“We would love to hear from any descendants of Tom Porter or his colleagues and invite them to see where their relatives once worked.”There was another surprise for the team when they entered the passageway – they were able to light the room. A switch, probably installed in the 1950s following restoration work after the second world war, not only worked but illuminated a large Osram manufactured bulb marked “HM Government Property”.Collins said the reveal would now be digitised as part of Parliament’s restoration and renewal programme, so that the doorway would never disappear again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a6a2207406240ad3bfa6f1a8a5bb5ae0f663274/0_245_1633_980/master/1633.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dda98d703893b2925f344e9a17e7de68","title":"from the tech hound to the new parents what kind of skier are you","story":"Whether you’re skiing for the first time, a show-off or après-ski royalty, here’s how to make the most of the slopes this seasonThe tech hound may be looking at you but they’re not actually listening to a word you say.

Speed, distance, altitude, vertical drop, crystals captured … friends of the tech hound may want to take their own noise-cancelling headphones on holiday.The tech hound laughs in the face of unplugging for a digital-free ski break. They have a camera in their helmet, an augmented reality version of the slopes playing in their goggles and smart boots fitted with a wearable device to deliver real-time audio ski coaching tips via an app. They’d be filming it all on their drone if the devices weren’t banned from most ski resorts.Tips for tech hounds: Check in with your resort to see what tech is on offer before you arrive. For instance, Club Med has introduced digital RFID bracelets, which provide room access and easy payment around the resort property. Perfect for the techy on the slopes.For the show-off, the mountain is a mere background wallpaper in the story of their life, the gondola is a place to do their makeup, and their skis purely a means of transport to push from one epic selfie spot to another. Of which there are so many all around.The show-off works best on bluebird days and hides in the hotel during photographically challenging blizzards or whiteouts.

They’d seen Ski Sunday and watched a couple of YouTube tutorials on the flight over. The first-timer was used to success, unaccustomed to failure, which might explain why they asked for expert skis at the hire shop. And then proceeded to almost twist a knee when their binding didn’t release during a pile-up, which they themselves had caused by skiing into a group getting off the chairlift.At least it saved them from taking on the icy black run they were about to attempt, though. The lifties bundled the first-timer back down the way they came, to the safety of the green runs and covered magic carpet. And there they skied, with their bum in the air as is the form for all beginners who don’t have lessons, being overtaken by kids half their size, until the end of their holiday.Tips for first-timers: Get lessons. There’s no shame in ski school. It’s the quickest way to progress, and even advanced skiers will improve with some tailored tuition. And thanks to Club Med’s partnership with Ecole du Ski Français (ESF), customers get free lessons (available Monday to Friday).Après-ski royalty does not care about first lifts. They’re not even sure they exist, though they did hear someone mention the concept once. Just before midday is when après-ski royalty likes to head up the mountain to avoid the afternoon lift pass rush. Queues are not their scene at all.They might do a red run, a quick head-clearer, with a pace and poise that belies the little amount of time they actually spend on snow rather than in the bar. And then it’s time to settle down for lunch at a sunny outdoor deck with a cocktail or two, moving to each new après spot like clockwork with the sun as it shifts around the mountain.At three, it’s time for the VIP bar at La Folie Douce, where they’ll dance on a table draped in a sea of feather boas. Obvs. As the sun starts to set, après-ski royalty styles it down the mountain and heads home.Tips for après-ski royalty: Research happy hour slots and the best après spots in advance so you can plan your route with precision.Resort pick: Club Med Alpe d’Huez is a top resort for après-ski vibes, with one of the finest Folie Douce in the Alps.The new parents stand at the top of the chairlift scratching their heads. They’re sure they’ve forgotten something. Gloves, poles, phone, oh yes, they remember, we have a child now! But it’s OK, she’s in nursery today. Blinking into the morning sun, the dad remembers he left his goggles on the changing mat, while the mum wonders if the white on her jacket is milk, baby sick or snow.Then they push off – it feels weird at first, but they embrace their newfound freedom, skiing together in the endless white. It’s just like the old days, except this morning they have the slopes to themselves as only new parents and powder hounds are up this early.They’re exhausted by lunchtime and downing double espressos to get through the afternoon, but they return to their child with a sparkle in their eyes. They only planned to use the odd day of nursery, but they sign their beloved up for the rest of the week.Tips for new parents: All-inclusive snow trips are a great option for families with young children, thanks to their on-site nurseries, child-friendly meal provision, and day-long kids’ clubs.Resort pick: Club Med Les Arcs Panorama, where the Club Med has one of the best childcare setups in the Alps.Club Med, founded in 1950, is the pioneer of the all-inclusive concept, offering nearly 70 premium resorts in stunning locations around the world including North and South America, Caribbean, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Mediterranean."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82df378803fe493f7eb757a1bba636e14d665bd6/76_0_7344_4407/master/7344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5cf95675fe91e805c00a140700752d0","title":"share your views on gene editing","story":"We would like to find out what you think about gene editing.

In tests with bags of chips in seaside towns, she found that staring the birds out put them off their daring raids.To follow up that work, Goumas wanted to see whether gulls pick up on subtle human cues to help them find their next meal. And so she set off to the Cornish towns of Falmouth, St Ives, Newquay and Penzance, and Plymouth in Devon, armed with shop-bought flapjacks in shiny blue wrappers, a supply of blue sponges, and a pair of dark glasses.For the first experiment, Goumas donned the sunglasses and walked towards her chosen bird, carrying a bucket with a flapjack in each hand. When she was about eight metres from the gull, she sat down, flipped the buckets over so they concealed the snacks, and pushed them out to her sides. She then lifted off the buckets, picked up one of the flapjacks, stood up and pretended to eat it. After 20 seconds, she put the flapjack back and retreated a safe distance.To see whether the effect held true for other items, Goumas set off to different parts of the towns in search of more gulls. Once in place, she performed the same experiment but substituted the flapjacks for little blue sponges. This time, the gulls pecked both the handled and unhandled items roughly equally.“Seagulls have made an association between humans and food and the reason for that is probably that we’re not disposing of our food properly when we’ve finished it,” Goumas said. Details of the work are published in Royal Society Open Science.“Whereas a lot of animals may not be able to live alongside humans and make use of urban environments, herring gulls seem to have been able to adapt and this is possibly one way they have become successful,” Goumas said.“Most seagulls don’t snatch food from people, they wait.

I danced in the street, on my way to school, in the local shop and at the back of the smoke-filled bingo hall where I tagged along every Thursday night with a neighbour.I was seven or eight when I asked my mum and dad if I could go to dance lessons. Someday, maybe, they told me. There just wasn’t the money for luxuries like that. I couldn’t let it go, so when I heard disco-dancing classes had started for 10p every Tuesday night at the church hall, there was no stopping me. It was exactly the amount I got in pocket money on a Friday when my dad came home from working on the building site. Each week until my early teens I walked the mile to the church hall where I handed it over and danced my heart out for 90 minutes.Peggy said I was good, that I should enter the regional disco-dancing championships. I ran home to tell my mum, who was peeling a bag of potatoes in the living room as she watched the TV, with a baby and a toddler. My other siblings were out in the street playing.“Sorry, love,” Mum said, “we just can’t afford it.” “It’s only 50p to enter,” I countered, but she said nothing and looked back with sad eyes.A week later I won £1.50 at the bingo. I gave my parents a pound and kept the rest. That Saturday I put on my best red blouse under the denim dungarees I practically lived in but which were an inch too short, and laced up my one pair of decent shoes after polishing the toes and began the three-mile walk in the rain to the other end of the city. I’d never been to that side of town with its big houses and manicured gardens. It was like another world.The convention centre was vast. Groups of girls began piling in, giggling and sparkling in the most incredible outfits I had ever laid eyes on. A posse of mothers followed the girls, all carrying little pink-coloured cases.I approached the long table at the front of the room, my hair still wet from the rain, where I handed over my 50p entrance fee and a middle-aged man gave me a white, square piece of paper with the number 11 on it. Girls, clucking loudly and preening, raced to the floor and took up spaces. One by one they edged me towards the back. Mothers stared at me from the sidelines. That was the first time I felt the sting of other people’s pity and when I realised, on a visceral level, that being from a poor background came (though I certainly hadn’t heard of the concept yet) with a stigma attached to it. Being poor or “on welfare” was a source of shame.Other incidents followed. Like realising our first home, where I lived until the age of seven, was nothing short of a slum: eight of us slept in two tiny, damp bedrooms. The house was overrun with rats there was no bathroom, indoor toilet or central heating and the kitchen was a makeshift scullery with a plastic corrugated roof. Having a fridge or washing machine was unimaginable. My mum kept it immaculately clean and looking as nice as possible, but there’s only so much makeup you can put on a pig.Later my dad became unemployed and had to claim the “dole” for long periods of time. Even within a community where many people were in the same situation, this was a source of humiliation: relying on state assistance to get by was seen by some as a sign of parental failure. While we had enough food to mostly meet our daily needs (we had to borrow from neighbours when things got really tight), occasional treats were often paid for by going into debt with loan sharks. Although we were far from unusual – west Belfast, which was also one of the main flashpoints during Northern Ireland’s sectarian conflict in the 1970s and 1980s, was among the most deprived areas in the whole of western Europe – I hated how much we had to struggle and how much shame there was in not being able to afford what others could.Like most poorer families – and this is true today – we lived our lives in the poorer parts of town. We didn’t have middle-class friends. But, when I first began to understand that we were looked down upon or pitied by many more financially fortunate people, the undercurrent of shame stayed with me for a long time. Anyone who has grown up poor will have similar stories to tell: those small or large experiences or encounters that force you to register that your family is not just lacking in material things (as hard as that may be), but that as a kid you are set apart from other children. If you have never lived on the breadline, it’s probably difficult to grasp, for example, that for many people, no matter how hard they work at their minimum-wage precarious jobs, they just never have enough to make the rent, eat nutritious food every day, or buy a much-needed new pair of shoes for their kids, or a warm winter coat. You might not have thought about what it feels like to have no choice but to swallow your pride and go to a food bank to stock up on essentials because you don’t qualify for state assistance – or what you do qualify for falls far short of what you actually need to survive and help you get back on your feet. Yet, every single day, people all over the US and the UK live with the gross injustice that is being poor and with the humiliation of being blamed for circumstances beyond their control. It doesn’t have to be this way. It really doesn’t. Being poor is not inevitable or due to personal flaws.From a distance, my story could be construed as someone who “pulled themselves up by their bootstraps” and escaped poverty. I didn’t. I was a beneficiary of the welfare state. It might not have been perfect, but it was a safety net. I had access to good council housing from the age of seven, and to free healthcare and free school meals. And I had teachers who passionately advocated for the rights of children growing up in poverty and encouraged us to believe in ourselves and to challenge anyone or any system that tried to tell us we were undeserving.I have learned a great deal about the structural causes and consequences of poverty and inequality while researching and writing The Shame Game. Project Twist-It is a platform I created for people with experiences of poverty to share their stories, and for advocacy groups to highlight their work fighting poverty. There are too many to name here but they include people working with organisations such as ATD Fourth World in the US and UK and Poverty2Solutions in the UK, formerly homeless female campaigners in the US and army veterans, food-bank volunteers, and artists, writers and musicians. What we have to say matters. We can make a difference. I have come to understand how we might build a new narrative that helps address the structural causes of poverty and steers us towards a greater consensus on how we can tackle the inequality that holds us back. As one of the many contributors to Project Twist-It, teacher and artist Janet Owen Driggs, put it: ‘“We need to identify the narratives that underpin structural inequality and consider how they keep us swirling, applauding and, too often, drowning. And we need to tell each other about possible futures.”Extreme poverty and inequality in America and Britain are the result of a political choice that is causing millions to suffer – but neither is inevitable and they are fixable. Bad narratives underpin and enable bad policy. We saw that all too clearly when austerity was rolled out across the UK after the financial crisis. So, we need to construct a new narrative one that reflects the reality of people’s lives, not an imagined one-dimensional “scrounger” or “skiver”. And we need a narrative that starts from the premise that all of us have the right to live with dignity and without impoverishment. The dominant poverty narrative, as the US scholar Chuck Collins so succinctly puts it – that we are where we economically deserve to be – has deep roots.From politics to the media and the wider culture, it is entrenched and it will be no easy task to overcome. However, I have observed a growing impetus for change. An important way to begin to dent the narrative is by elevating the voices and stories of those of us with experience. As one of the figureheads of the Poor People’s Campaign in the US, the Rev Dr William Barber II told me: “We have to shift the narrative. But you can’t do this without shifting the narrators.”• This is an edited extract from The Shame Game by Mary O’Hara (Policy Press, £12.99).

The pressure is always felt in the final major competition before the climax of the Olympic cycle – it has been that way all through British Cycling’s lottery‑funded glory years – but this week in Berlin it will be just that little bit more acute.The Olympic runes will be acutely read as per usual, but the waters will be muddied because in the past four years the pool of nations competing at the highest level appears to have widened, times have plummeted in the two team pursuits, while from a British perspective the medal bankers such as the men’s and women’s team pursuit quartets have not been at their levels of previous years.The past two Olympic cycles show a definite pattern: GB tread water at world championships in non‑Olympic years, picking up one or two gold medals and usually finishing between fourth and sixth. The 2013 triumph in Minsk, with five golds and a finish atop the medal table, now looks like an aberration. What cannot be argued is at this point in the Olympic cycle there is always a significant upturn in the team’s fortunes, even if not on the scale of Manchester in 2008, with nine gold medals of a possible 18.The room for improvement is obvious: last year in Pruskow, Poland, the team’s haul of only four medals was relatively low, with no victories in any Olympic events – Elinor Barker’s women’s scratch gold was the highlight – even if it was not on the scale of the catastrophe in Paris in 2015. As ever, it is time for the team’s senior members to step up.Jason Kenny requires one more gold to surpass Sir Chris Hoy as Britain’s most prolific Olympic gold medallist, but he has enjoyed a typically restrained time between Games, including a year out of the sport which led to speculation over his retirement at one point he will be closely watched in the sprint events – where the Dutch have raised the bar since Rio – as this point in the cycle is when he usually emerges from hibernation. His wife, Laura, is getting over a shoulder fracture from last month, and now has her status as the team’s go-to omnium rider threatened by the Scot Katie Archibald.Another mainstay is the men’s team pursuit rider Ed Clancy, now almost 35 with a gold medal‑winning record at the discipline that goes back to 2005. Clancy’s record now includes a further four world pursuit titles and three Olympic golds. “He’s the most successful rider in the history of the event,” the men’s endurance coach, Iain Dyer, said. “He’s going for a fourth Olympic gold in a row, he’s highly motivated and we’d all like to be part of that success.”The championships open on Wednesday with the men’s and women’s team pursuits, both of which are usually Team GB’s strongest suits. The hope is both deliver on the first evening, creating useful momentum for the next four days, but that task looks more complicated than in the past. The men’s event used to be a straightforward match between Britain and Australia, but those days are gone.Another perennial question at this point is how much of their aerodynamic kit the various teams have thrown into the winter, when qualifying for the world championships and Olympics is at stake, and how much is being held back. Dyer said it is hard to tell precisely where his team sit, because “we’ve deployed very little as yet, so what the package brings has yet to be realised”.While the men’s quartet won the world title in the Netherlands in 2018, the GB women have been unable to replicate the dominant form they showed between London and Rio, without a world title since then. But Barker, another relative veteran, said they are feeling no more pressure than usual in spite of the strong showings from their old rival Australia – the gold medallists last year – the USA and New Zealand. “We are desperate to win every single race, we are aware of it, but winning runs always come to an end. There is never any room for complacency.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/363e18c34df220a2f143a712e2e141deb74a3c1b/0_296_2139_1283/master/2139.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b67e167a940ce3b077b3ebb8c51db206","title":"womens t20 world cup england thailand match report","story":"England got their T20 World Cup campaign back on track in convincing fashion against Thailand in Canberra on Wednesday, after captain Heather Knight struck her maiden T20 international hundred to lead her side to a record 98-run win.Knight’s partner for most of the England innings was Nat Sciver, the pair sharing a 169-run partnership – the highest for any wicket at a Women’s T20 World Cup – as Sciver brought up a 45-ball half-century, her second in as many matches this tournament.Having helped England amass a total of 176-2, Sciver then chipped in with two wickets in the 14th over, decimating Thailand’s chase the Asian side eventually concluded their innings on 78-7.In truth Thailand – who freely admit they are a bowling side – never looked like getting close to the required runs, their efforts fizzling out in the face of some excellent fielding by a resurgent England, including a direct hit run out from Anya Shrubsole. Only opener Natthakan Chantham showed any resistance, acquiring a steady 32 (53 balls) before being trapped lbw by Sophie Ecclestone.After their disastrous first outing against South Africa at the Waca Ground, the change of location from Perth to Canberra appears to have benefitted England: Knight in particular relishes batting at Manuka Oval, having hit all four of her 50-plus scores in T20 internationals here. After she was forced into defending her team’s controversial strategy of playing eight batsmen in the pre-match press conference, the skipper’s innings – the highest ever score by any England player at a Women’s T20 World Cup – could be interpreted as an act of defiance, though it was helped along by more than a handful of full tosses from the inexperienced Thai bowlers.Her captain’s knock came at a crucial time: Thailand had given England quite a scare up front, after Amy Jones was stumped without scoring off the second ball of the day, advancing down the wicket to off-spinner Nattaya Boochatham. Opening partner Danni Wyatt then fell for a golden duck, driving into the hands of a ing cover fielder to leave England 7-2 in the second over.The ever-reliable Knight and Sciver, though, calmed fraying English nerves with a partnership that began sedately with nurdled singles, before a significant push in the 13th over. Ironically it seemed to be the near-run out of Sciver that signalled the change of pace: advancing down the pitch from the non-striker’s end, she was sent back by Knight and had to e full-stretch to avoid the incoming throw from Thailand captain Sornnarin Tippoch at cover. The very next ball, Knight brought up her 1,000th T20i run in style – sweeping Ratanaporn Padunglerd for six over backward square leg. From there, the pair never looked back.England return to Manuka Oval on Friday for their next group match against Pakistan, another must-win encounter if they are to guarantee progression to the semi-finals. Wednesday’s performance at Canberra will be a significant fillip to those hopes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc09dad833a1e8e18c528f52c3e9580301f10d26/0_294_4743_2846/master/4743.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91f512767498228d53bdd8a7f93c6a5b","title":"the prince of egypt review dominion london","story":"Dominion, LondonIt’s got pageantry, pyramids and dazzling dance moves, but this lavish stage adaptation drowns out the emotional drama DreamWorks’ musical animation The Prince of Egypt was praised to high heaven when it was released in 1998. Combining the Old Testament story of Moses, Ramses and the liberation of the Israelites with magnificent artwork, an Oscar-winning song and a star cast, the film produced box-office gold.This stage adaptation, however, does not come off to the same spectacular effect, which is a puzzle in itself given that it has been in the making for years and is sprinkled with so much of the same stardust. It is produced by DreamWorks Theatricals, with Stephen Schwartz’s lyrics (he has written 10 new songs that sit alongside his five original numbers) and an impossibly lavish set.The staging, which is multi-layered and at times stretching out into the auditorium, might ironically be part of its problem. Scott Schwartz’s production is stuffed full of imagination but it is so excessive and outsized that it overwhelms the emotional drama, sucking away any intimacy between the actors.It has a thumping, big stadium feel in its sound and visual effects, and the best known songs – When You Believe and Deliver Us – still stand out, but almost all the others are drowned out by the scale of everything else on stage, while humorous lines from Philip LaZebnik’s book that worked well in the film fall flat.Liam Tamne as Ramses and Luke Brady as Moses work hard to make the songs and book affecting against the glut of pageantry on stage. Brady’s heroic performance gains some emotional traction by the second half, but characterisation overall seems one-note: Moses’s wife Tzipporah (Christine Allado) enters as a slave girl with Walk Like an Egyptian dance moves Ramses’s father Seti (Joe Dixon) projects a loud authoritarianism Hotep, the high priest to the Pharaohs (Adam Pearce), looks like a Bond villain, and other cast members seem featureless.Kevin Depinet’s set design and Jon Driscoll’s projections create an ancient Babylon by way of Las Vegas with snazzy projections of pyramids, hieroglyphics and big, cheesy exoticism alongside Ann Hould-Ward’s predominantly white, gold and glitter costumes.The Prince of Egypt is at its strongest as a dance production with beautiful visual formations through bodywork when chariots, wells or rolling desert sands are created by groups of dancers.

What a pity it isn’t a patch on the originalEven to read about the original Twilight Zone, the brainchild of Rod Serling that premiered in 1959 and ran for five years, is to be consumed immediately by the need to watch (or re-watch) all 156 episodes. Every premise snags the attention, even if the twist is known. Many have entered into pop cultural consciousness and remained there ever since, so deeply did Serling and his expert team of writers and directors’ barbs embed. It is still impossible to resist the lure.With such a potent asset in the archives, it would have been foolish to hope that perfection could have remained unsullied for long. It was rebooted once in 1985 and again nearly 20 years ago (for one dismal season) and now, perhaps because anthology series are having a moment, the time has been judged right for a new one. The latest is executive produced by Jordan Peele, a director who is in the middle of his own well-earned moment, built on his critically lauded and commercially successful film debut Get Out in 2017 and buffed by last year’s equally acclaimed horror Us.The 10 episodes of the new incarnation, airing on SyFy, are a mix of remakes of Serling-era stories and new ones. Of the three released for review, it is hard to imagine anyone wanting to rewatch any of them, let alone for future generations to have their frames of reference still populated by any of the tropes or twists that turn up here. It is also hard to imagine, even though he provides the top-and-tail narration to each instalment, that Peele himself had much to do with the series creatively. It is simply too dull, badly paced and bereft of imagination to suggest there was any more than the lightest touch at any point from the comedy-horror maestro.Every episode – which run for between 35 and 55 minutes – feels too long. The shortest is a remake of the classic Nightmare at 20,000 Feet. That it is retitled Nightmare at 30,000 Feet is an indication of the level of effort and fresh invention that has gone into the endeavour. Instead of William Shatner spotting gremlins on the wing we have Adam Scott as investigative reporter Justin Sanderson listening to a prophetic true-crime podcast telling the story of the mysterious downing of the very plane he is on and culminating in a twist after the twist that doesn’t really make a lot of sense.Instead of the original series’ bleakly measured contemplation of mankind’s capacity for cruelty and evil, the reboot falls into either preachiness or schmaltz. The former dogs a potentially deeply involving, emotive story (Replay), in which an African American mother, Nina (Sanaa Lathan), uses the supernatural properties of her father’s old camcorder to rewind time and try to escape the pursuit of a white cop (Glenn Fleshler) intent on shooting her son, Dorian (Damson Idris). As a bald depiction of race relations between police and those they have supposedly sworn to protect it is fine. As a metaphor for the circumscription of potential in beleaguered communities, it almost works. But the supposedly rousing speech Nina gives when she finally faces Officer Lasky and his buddies down at the gateway to the college, as the other students and their parents raise their phones behind her to record everything in solidarity, is a platitudinous, half-hearted thing that symbolises the lack of inspiration throughout.There are bright spots, usually confined to inidual performances. Every member of each cast is good, but there are stand-outs. Fleshler as Lasky does a terrifying amount of being terrifying with very little and, in the opening episode, The Comedian, Tracy Morgan evokes a powerful sense of the diabolic in little more than a cameo role as he approaches the protagonist Samir (Kumail Nanjiani) with his Faustian bargain. (Morgan is all the more sinister, perhaps, for those of us who know him primarily as the unstoppably comic force Tracy Jordan in 30 Rock.) In the same episode, Diarra Kilpatrick as Didi, Samir’s comedy rival and eventual victim to his increasing corruption, was an invigorating force to be reckoned with. Her presence almost occluded a script that is so heavy on exposition that at one point Samir is required to say, wonderingly: “He’s … disappeared!”Basically, it’s The Twilight Zone as if written in a twilight sleep. The original episodes are almost all up on YouTube and elsewhere. If you like your sci-fihorror to dissect humanity’s worse impulses and hint at an abyss of depravities upon whose brink we all teeter, I suggest you head there rather than to 2020’s denatured pabulum. There you will find the fifth dimension."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1ac01d3d9b5838f14c39e5e7de108654b5765c6/0_615_5947_3567/master/5947.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=972bf2fcdc89db88f7fd03945667c918","title":"i had to develop a thick skin gemma collins on towie trolls and life as a tabloid underdog","story":"‘You get the wig on, you put the lipstick on, you get the big eyelashes on and that’s the GC,” says Gemma Collins, explaining her alter ego. “It’s like Paul O’Grady when he does Lily Savage ... But when I’m not working, I don’t wear a scrap of makeup.”It is hard to imagine that today, as the GC strikes a pose in a photo studio laden with rails of clothes. A makeup artist, a hairdresser, a photographer and multiple agents fan around her. “Pull down my sleeve, Jeff!” she calls out to her stylist. The room buzzes with chatter, as Collins – who says she has been awake and working since 5.30am, when she fashioned a makeshift eye mask out of her dressing gown cord and got into a taxi – summons various members of her team.It is little wonder Collins lives a double life. In 2011, the former car salesperson joined the cast of The Only Way Is Essex, the wildly popular ITV reality soap opera, in which real people from Essex play themselves in plotlines and scenarios invented by the show’s producers (succinctly described by one comedian as “a never-ending hen night mixed with Waiting for Godot”). In the 10 years since, she has become a titan of British pop culture, a bombastic blonde known for hilarious one-liners, calamitous public falls (disappearing down a trapdoor at a Radio 1 event, for example) and over-the-top demands of the people who work for her.In August, she launched a podcast with BBC Sounds, which zoomed straight to the top of the iTunes chart, completing her transformation from bit-part actor on reality TV to the biggest podcaster in Britain. Now on its second series, the Gemma Collins Podcast is a riot of bizarre chat, hilariously meandering stories and motivational speeches.“I think it’s been one of my most proudest jobs that I’ve done in my career, to be honest, because I get to be myself on it,” she says. “It’s not really overly scripted or directed, it’s like: right, what do you want to talk about this week?” It also means connecting with her audience on a closer level: she offers unbridled body positivity (“Just be you – if you just be you, nothing can go wrong,” she implored listeners in a recent episode) and an agony aunt section, in which she advises listeners on their life and relationship woes. “Dear Deidre, eat your heart out!” she says with a laugh, although it is clear that she has embraced the role. “I’m here for a reason and I think it’s to reach out to people – whether that’s to give people a little bit of confidence if they’re having a terrible day, or to give them advice, or just to make them laugh.”As I wait for her to finish the photoshoot, she gestures to a pink fleece blanket in the studio and tells me to put it on in case I am cold. We then head to a local cafe, where she holds open the door for me. On the way there, the zingers continue to flow like prosecco in an Essex nightclub. “I was supposed to be going to China this month, but, with the coronavirus, I don’t wanna risk it.” She pauses. “Then again, when it’s your time, it’s your time.” She sounds somewhere between a reality star and Julia Davis in Nighty Night.Collins is warm and open. As we wait for our mugs of hot chocolate, a fan stops to ask her what she is doing here. She tells him about our interview and they natter until our drinks arrive. She is a far cry from the woman denounced in the tabloids for her supposedly monstrous conduct. “Gemma Collins’ ‘extreme a behaviour forces Dancing on Ice staff to work through lunch’,” reads one headline. Another says: “Gemma Collins, you’re going to be single for ever if you don’t stop being a dating a”, claiming that, “if she really wants to find love, she should stop being so awful” to men. A third headline reads: “Gemma Collins labelled a ‘rude bitch’ as she kicks camera crew out of shop during Diva Forever premiere,” after she asked a crew filming her for a reality show to leave her Brentwood boutique. For every instance where she has been portrayed as rude or arrogant, there are another 10 headlines about her body, her weight or her fertility. “Gemma Collins ‘will have a surrogate because she doesn’t want to put on weight’” claimed one story.“There was a time where I just thought: ‘This is all getting a bit much,’” she says of the tabloid coverage. “I had to grow a very thick skin very fast. I think that’s where the GC came about.” It may seem difficult to tell the GC and Collins apart, but for her the differences are clear. “I try not to bring any attention to myself. I like to cook, I like nature, I like to read. I do like to shop, don’t get me wrong, every now and then. I like a good day out in London, but, yeah, they are two very different people – massively.” Her close friends, she says, “don’t even ask about the GC. But when my best friend drops her kids at school, people in the playground ask her: ‘What’s she like?’ That’s the million-dollar question that everyone wants to know. The truth is, in day-to-day life, I’m just grinding like everyone else.”It must be extraordinarily difficult to keep “Gemma Collins” going in the face of a media industry that wants headlines. Her partner, James Argent – known as Arg – also appeared on Towie and his problems with addiction have featured in gossip columns in recent years. A few weeks after we meet, Collins posts on Twitter about the tragic death of the Love Island host Caroline Flack, commenting on her own experience of being “personally hounded” by a tabloid reporter.Perhaps her belief in fate and destiny is a way to rationalise how she has gone from earning £50 a day on Towie to amassing a fortune estimated at £3m. Collins was born in Romford, on the border of London and Essex, to a working-class family – her parents, Alan and Joan, and her older brother, Russell – that she describes as “very grounded”. Even now, her dad, who has watched only one episode of Towie, keeps an eye on her finances for her (“He called me last Christmas and was like: I can’t believe you spent £2,000 in Harrods”).“We was really poor growing up,” she says. “People don’t believe it when I say it.” She mentions an appearance on the Jonathan Ross Show last year, where she mentioned that the family didn’t have a toaster in their kitchen when she was growing up. “People sort of laughed like I was joking around, but I’m not: it’s the truth. My dad had to do an extra shift in the pub to put shoes on my feet. I used to go round my nan’s and she’d have HP sauce in the cupboard and a bit of bread – I’d have an HP sauce sandwich and it was the best times ever. There wasn’t luxuries.” Reading between the lines, it seems to have informed Collins’s relentless work ethic: as well as her boutique, she has her own perfume, Diva Pink, and a clothing line for the retailer Boohoo. She even lists her castoffs on the online marketplace Depop items recently for sale included a camisole from Missguided (£7) and a New Look T-shirt (£5).Collins is also far more understated than the GC when it comes to material goods. The GC, she says, would love to be “cruising around in a Bentley” Collins just bought a used car (“Three years old, so it had already depreciated in value”) and was papped last year driving her sister-in-law’s Nissan Micra (“The papers kindly said the car was worth £695 – it was more like £395”). “People just think I lay in bed every day with people fanning me down or bathing in asses’ milk like Cleopatra,” she says. “It’s not the case: I work, I work and I work.”I wonder what it must be like for Collins to have two personas. Is everyday life ever overwhelming? “I’ve been to shopping centres before where people all start crowding round. They get excited, obviously, but when I go to the shopping centre, I’m not the GC. I’m just there with my mum, and then I’ll have had so many selfies that I’m like: shit, I’ve left the shop and I’ve not got what I’ve needed to get. Some days I do just want to go to the market with my friends, but then people will be like: what’s she doing at the market?”She is keen to emphasise that she is always happy to interact with fans, but she thinks they can cross a line. “Sometimes they bark at you like a rottweiler: give us a picture, give us a picture ... all they have to say is: ‘All right, Gem, how are you? Can I have a picture?’ and I’d be like: yeah, course. When they start grabbing and mauling it, it’s a bit ... it’s scary, you know? I would never say that to someone, or pull someone.” Ever the stoic, she describes such interactions as like “loading the dishwasher. It’s just a part of life.”Collins calls herself the “underdog” of Towie – and it is easy to see why. “Someone said to me once: you know, it just don’t stack up – you’re the fat one, you’re not the most prettiest, but you’ve been the most successful,” she says. “I was like: that’s charming!”Criticism of her image was one thing, but Towie also provoked a classist brand of disdain among audiences and critics alike, who reached for a decades-old cliche of Essex’s inhabitants as coarse and uncultured. How did Collins react to this wave of criticism? “I was very proud to come from Essex, at the end of the day,” she says. “You know, there’s a lot of lovely people in Essex – just look at Gavin and Stacey. People can look down all they want, but there’s a lot of successful people there.” She tries not to dwell on the haters: “If they’ve got them awful thoughts in their head about people, what a shame for them.”A waiter comes to get our mugs. “Thank you very, very, very much,” she says to him, before turning to me: “You don’t want anything else, do you? A biscuit or anything?” As we get up to leave, she puts her slippers on – a pair of sequin Ugg boots – and asks if she can call me a taxi. “And if you ever want anything from my shop, anything, a bottle of perfume, you just give me a call.” I get the feeling I probably could."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/948bf8de70c7cdf124c6fe7e2da05132fb257df7/0_42_3503_2101/master/3503.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=586836f9a556b67858d4f80f61d3225f","title":"amazon go grocery supermarket seattle technology","story":"The new grocery store uses the same technology as Amazon Go stores: cameras and sensors that link to an online accountAn automated gate equipped with a series of scanners greets the mid-morning wave of shoppers entering the first bricks and mortar Amazon Go Grocery store in Tuesday in Seattle.It was opening day for the supermarket, and one by one each visitor placed their phone, with the Amazon Go app open, onto a clear square, allowing them access to pristine aisles of everything from oranges and avocados to yogurt and bacon.This is the trillion-dollar company’s first cashier-less supermarket. Coming out on the heels of the Amazon Go stores, which offer meals and snacks, but no check-out lines, the new store uses the same core technology.Through a series of cameras and sensors, everything a shopper picks up is automatically placed in their Amazon online basket account. It doesn’t matter whether you put it in a cart or straight into your personal backpack, if you pick it up and don’t put it back, once you leave the store, you’ll be getting an emailed bill that details the amount of money taken out of your Amazon account.There were small shopping carts, complementary bright green, reusable bags with the words “Amazon Go Grocery” on them, and even empty table tops specifically designed for mid-shop grocery sorting. A small team of eager employees hovered around, transporting produce from one aisle to another and answering questions.But at the exit, instead of a checkout register and cashier, there’s simply automated gates that open when you step up to them.Maddison Nicholas, 23, shopped at the store Tuesday and said the prices seemed cheaper than Whole Foods (also owned by Amazon) or QFC (Quality Food Centers), a local grocery store chain. But, after filling her bag with raspberries, strawberries, blackberries and watermelon, she said the automated system “makes it easy to spend more money than you would pulling out your card and seeing the total”.At 10,400 square feet, the window-filled building has a slightly smaller selection of products than traditional chain grocery stores. The supermarket also has one aisle full of home goods, including laundry detergent and shampoo, and a section filled with alcohol, which requires visitors show their id to an employee before entering.This is the tech company’s latest foray into the grocery store industry. In 2017, it bought Whole Foods and the hundreds of stores that make up the multinational supermarket chain. Amazon, which is headquartered in Seattle, also offers same-day grocery deliveries.There is something slightly unnerving about leaving a store without so much as scanning an item. Perhaps that’s why there’s a giant sign at the entrance with the words, “Just Walk Out Groceries.”Stephen Sheldon, 73, traveled about 9 blocks from his home to get to the store, and called the automated system “interesting,” but said he doesn’t really trust it.“I’m afraid to touch anything unless I plan to pick it up and put it in my bag,” he said.Sheldon, who is retired, said he lives much closer to three other grocery stores, so this one won’t be his go-to spot. He said he prefers the more traditional grocery stores, where he can watch each item get rung up by a clerk, and argue about prices if there’s a mix-up.Rex Farrand, 36, just moved from New York to Seattle with his fiancé three months ago, and said he decided to visit the store after hearing about it on the news. He said he liked the small selection because it wasn’t overwhelming, and remarked on how convenient the automated system is.“I can just imagine if you’re busy, coming here, I know I can get in and out as fast as I want to get in and out, and I’m not dependent on the lines or the registers and the clerks, so that’d be a reason to come to it,” said Farrand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47c7718e5ce763e49a3306304182ef2f5be3811f/0_265_4992_2995/master/4992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f87e534368de1e0c8fdbf300909097a","title":"democratic debate south carolina bernie sanders mike bloomberg joe biden","story":"The Democratic presidential candidates engaged in a series of chaotic and fiery exchanges on Tuesday night, in the final debate before the critical South Carolina presidential primary and Super Tuesday contests that could represent a make-or-break moment.Senator Bernie Sanders, the frontrunner who cruised to victory in Nevada last week, bore the brunt of criticism from a number of his centrist rivals, including the former vice-president Joe Biden, the ex-New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg, and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana.Buttigieg labelled Sanders a polarizing figure in the primary and warned of a race between the self-declared Democratic socialist and Trump, who has already sought to weaponise the spectre of socialism in the run-up to the November election.“If you think the last four years has been chaotic, isive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders v Donald Trump,” he said.The Vermont senator denied his policies were radical, and acknowledged the heat he attracted, stating wryly: “I’m hearing my name mentioned a little bit tonight. I wonder why.”In one of the earliest exchanges, Bloomberg – who is not on the ballot in South Carolina but is seeking to make gains in the 16 states and territories voting next Tuesday – referenced recent reports to suggest that Sanders’ campaign was benefiting from Russian interference in the 2020 primary.Addressing his response directly to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, Sanders said: “If I’m president of the United States, trust me, you’re not going to interfere in any more American elections.”The 78-year-old Vermont senator turned a long-shot, anti-establishment bid for the presidency into a “political revolution” that has energized the Democratic party’s progressive base.\u0026nbspThe self-proclaimed Democratic socialist began his political career nearly 40 years ago. But it wasn’t until his 2016 bid for the presidency that Sanders became a national figure as a new generation of Democrats embraced his populist economic policies.\u0026nbspMany of his ideas, which were once called radical, have also been embraced by his rival 2020 contenders. His signature Medicare-for-all plan for universal healthcare would eliminate private health insurance and create a free at the point of care system, and he pledges a $15 minimum wage and free college tuition.\u0026nbspSanders was hospitalized after a heart attack in October, but only took a short break away from the campaign trail.\u0026nbsp Can the anointed “godfather of the progressive movement” go all the way in 2020?The South Carolina primary on Saturday marks the first vote in the deep south and in which African American voters form a majority of the electorate for the first time. On Super Tuesday – 3 March – the candidates will be vying for more than a third of the available delegates that are key to securing the nomination – a high stakes day that has the potential to propel one candidate to solid frontrunner status and see others drop out.Biden has long courted voters in the black community, touting his record as vice-president to America’s first African American president, Barack Obama. But recent polling has suggested that Sanders, buoyed by success in a multicultural electorate in Nevada, is the frontrunner with black voters nationally.Biden, who holds a slim lead in South Carolina according to recent polling, said he intended to win in the state on Saturday, and pledged to nominate an African American woman to the supreme court if elected. But he also tried to tear strips off Sanders, his closest rival in the state.Referencing the 2015 terror attack at Mother Emanuel AME church, which stands a few dozen feet from the debate stage in downtown Charleston, Biden pointed to Sanders’ mixed voting record on gun control, and touted his own 1994 legislation implementing five-day waiting periods for firearms purchases.Sanders initially tried to pivot to criticizing Biden for his record on trade deals, prompting more boos from the audience, before saying: “I have cast thousands of votes, including bad votes,” Sanders said. “That was a bad vote.”As with much of the debate there was little follow-up questioning after Sanders’ significant acknowledgement, as moderators struggled to keep the candidates from interrupting each other, talking over each other, shouting, and speaking for longer than their assigned time limits.The Trump campaign quickly seized on the disorder, issuing a statement saying: “The Democrat party is a hot mess and tonight’s debate was further evidence that not one of these candidates is serious or can stand toe-to-toe with President Trump.”The Massachusetts senator, Elizabeth Warren, a fellow progressive, also took aim at Sanders, saying the pair agreed on a lot of things, but that she would be a “better president”.“Progressives have one shot, and we need to spend it on a leader who will get something done,” Warren said.Warren also renewed her attacks on Bloomberg over the billionaire philanthropist’s treatment of female employees. Warren, who saw a surge in fundraising after her attacks on Bloomberg at last week’s debate, resurfaced an allegation that Bloomberg had once told a pregnant subordinate to “kill it”.The billionaire former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer, returning to the debate stage as recent polls place him third in South Carolina, was also drawn into an angry exchange with Biden, who questioned his record investing in a private prison company, a move Steyer said he also regretted.In a withering put down, Biden referred to Steyer as “Tommy come lately” as the billionaire pushed back and argued he had done more to support minority communities than the former vice-president.As the debate wound to a close the candidates began to move the focus towards more pointed criticism of the Trump administration, particularly the president’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak.Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar criticized the administration’s funding cuts to the Centre for Disease Control, the US government agency responsible for helping prevent global outbreaks.She argued that the president “hasn’t really yet addressed the nation on this topic” and urged the administration to work on better quarantine and treatment plans.Shortly after the debate Trump, seemingly listening in to the discussion, tweeted: “CDC and my administration are doing a GREAT job handling Coronavirus…”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a222b38392aaae27e77664b9ce8d8636d59b466/0_207_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47f6483c5a2778f297732807be3e14ad","title":"how have your travel plans been affected by the coronavirus","story":"We want to hear from those who have cancelled or rearranged travel plans due to the outbreakItaly and Iran have been forced to introduce travel restrictions due to major outbreaks in both countries.

Dawn Dunning, an aspiring actor who Weinstein lured to the InterContinental hotel in Manhattan then offered her movie roles on the condition she had a threesome with him and another woman, endured that humiliation in 2004.The actor Ashley Judd, who was not involved in the trial, alleges the movie producer sexually harassed her in 1996, while her fellow star Rose McGowan says she was sexually assaulted by him the following year.Weinstein continues to insist that all his sexual encounters were consensual. But with 105 women now having leveled accusations against him, and with his sentencing set for 11 March, how he managed to avoid trouble for decades is now a burning issue.Much of the answer appears to lie in the army of helpers he deployed to deflect and silence his accusers. Glimpses of that horde of auxiliaries – the word “enablers” has been used – flashed up in the course of the seven-week trial.They ranged from the lowly limousine drivers employed to transport women discreetly to “business meetings” in hotel rooms to the internationally – renowned lawyers who drew up gagging non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). The court also heard of Black Cube, the firm of corporate private detectives founded by former Israeli intelligence agents.A key element of the elaborate network of Weinstein helpers were the female assistants. At trial, the jury heard of several who were used to arrange “appointments” with his potential victims, luring them with offers of auditions or production jobs, then making them disappear when all was done.Some of the assistants appear to have themselves been abused. The other woman in Weinstein’s intended threesome with Dunning was his assistant who was present in the hotel room when he made the proposition.The assistant’s lawyer has told the  that she is still traumatized from the brief time she worked for the film producer and is “a victim of Weinstein herself”.Other Weinstein acquaintances testified in court and denied the role they were alleged to have played in enabling Weinstein to molest young women. Claudia Salinas, a Mexican model, disputed in front of the jury the account given by one of the six accusers, Lauren Young, who said she was trapped with Weinstein inside a bathroom in a Beverly Hills hotel in 2013 after Salinas shut the door on them.Weinstein then went on to grope Young and masturbate in front of her, she said.“I would never close the door on anybody, ever,” Salinas countered.Once journalists from the New York Times and the New Yorker began to investigate the Hollywood titan’s track record with women, Weinstein took his network to another level. Over the years he wielded NDAs like weapons, reaching multiple settlements with women in which they received large payouts in return for their absolute silence.Many top lawyers were recruited in the effort. When their names emerged in the flurry of revelations that triggered the #MeToo movement, eyebrows were sharply raised.They included David Boies, a giant among liberal lawyers in America who until his work for Weinstein became public knowledge was best known for having represented Al Gore in his epic fight with George Bush in the 2000 presidential election and for his efforts on behalf of same-sex marriage.One of the jaw-dropping disclosures was that Boies contracted private detectives to try to foil the New York Times from exposing Weinstein at a time when the lawyer was also employed as a legal counsel to the newspaper. The Times promptly severed relations with him.Farrow revealed that it was Boies’s signature on the contract with Black Cube, the detective outfit populated by many former Mossad agents. At the trial at the New York supreme court the same contract was discussed in legal argument, with prosecutors noting that Black Cube was expecting to be paid $300,000 if they succeeded in scuppering the New York Times investigation.Another helper who raised eyebrows was Lisa Bloom, a Los Angeles-based lawyer who made her name representing the victims of sexual abuse, including several of the women trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein. Her reputation as a champion for survivors imploded when it emerged she had been retained by Weinstein in 2016 to help him beat back his detractors.In one devastating email from Bloom to the movie mogul, she said she felt equipped to help him “against the Roses of the world” – a reference to Rose McGowan. “They start out as impressive, bold women, but the more one presses for evidence, the weaknesses and lies are revealed … Clearly she must be stopped in her ridiculous, defamatory attacks on you.”In a recent interview with the , Bloom declined to admit she had written the memo, citing legal action. “Everything in that memo, if I did say it, I certainly don’t believe now,” she said.The final layer that has to be scrutinised in any post-trial reckoning involves the criminal justice system itself. Over decades law enforcement and prosecutors failed to engage with Weinstein despite some clear signals.This is an especially sensitive subject in the wake of the New York trial which was prosecuted under Cyrus Vance, the New York district attorney. In 2015 the same Cyrus Vance decided not to prosecute Weinstein after a Filipina-Italian model Ambra Gutierrez alleged he had groped her, even though she had obtained a taped audio recording in which the movie mogul made what sounded like a confession."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/974a885ed87b4fb3f217a80cb9d5e2053696967b/0_162_4158_2495/master/4158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e7858151b1f46d3768f46936e9c7b92","title":"no one has told us anything tourists on lockdown in tenerife hotel coronavirus","story":"Guests confined to hotel rooms complain of lack of information and fear a long waitBritish tourists have been left in limbo waiting to learn their fate after the Tenerife hotel they are staying in was placed in lockdown because of coronavirus fears.Guests were confined to their rooms after an Italian doctor who stayed at the hotel tested positive for the potentially deadly virus. Despite warnings from experts that the quarantine of passengers and staff on the Diamond Princess ship may have been counterproductive, allowing the virus to spread, tourists fear they may be in for a similarly long stay at the hotel.Hannah Green, 27, from Hertfordshire, who is staying with her boyfriend and one-year-old son, told PA Media: “We woke up to a note under our door this morning saying for health reasons not to leave our room.“I called downstairs to reception as soon as I saw it and they wouldn’t tell us anything. So I quickly got on my phone and googled and saw a man had tested positive for coronavirus so I basically assumed it was that.“But since then, we’ve had nothing from the hotel – no one has told us anything or what’s going to happen.”She said that since arriving on Saturday they had experienced a “holiday for hell”, having also been confined to the hotel on Sunday because of the sandstorm that struck the Canary Islands.“We’re in our room with the baby,” said Green. We’re worried for the baby … I don’t think we’ll be allowed to leave. We don’t want to be here. We’re fed up now.”The four-star H10 Costa Adeje Palace, located on the seafront, has 467 rooms, four pools and three restaurants. The quarantine meant customers missed lunch, forcing them to raid their minibars, although guests said they received food packages later in the afternoon.Steve McHardy, 53, an estate agent from Kinross, in eastern Scotland, said he and his wife Susan, also 53, were supposed to leave on Tuesday but woke up to messages from friends who live on the island telling them of the situation. They decided to sunbathe instead but but then were told to go to their room around lunchtime, he said.“There’s no indication of whether we’ll get out when we’ve been tested or after 14 days,” he told the . “People questioned how many doctors are coming. If there’s 1,000 people, you don’t know how long it’s going to take to be tested and how they will decide in what order people are tested.”He praised hotel staff but said information had not been forthcoming. “We’ve got jobs and animals to go back to,” he said before adding with resignation: “It is what it is. It’s day one if I’m here in 17 days’ time, it might be a different conversation.”David Hoon, 60, and Pamela Scott, 63, from Matlock, Derbyshire, said the situation was very worrying.“Nobody is telling us what’s going on, how long this is going to last and who is going to feed us,” Hoon told MailOnline. “The way this has been handled is a disgrace.“The hotel is like a ghost house and my fear is that by trapping us inside it, we stand more chance of catching the coronavirus. This whole thing is very worrying.”A message on the hotel’s website said it would be closed until 15 March. It said it was “providing customers and hotel staff all the necessary care and attention so that, despite the inconveniences this situation may cause, they are taken care of in the best way possible”.The hotel was locked down after an Italian doctor complained of feeling ill and tested positive for the virus on Monday. The following day, the regional government announced that his wife had also tested positive.The Italian couple are thought to have spent six days at the four-star seafront hotel, which is used by the package holiday firms Tui and Jet2Holidays. They are believed to be from the north of Italy, where most of the country’s 283 cases have been reported.On Tuesday afternoon, the hotel, on the outskirts of Adeje, was guarded by police officers in face masks who declined to speak to the media, and a red barrier had been erected a few hundred metres from the main entrance.The shops, bars and restaurants inside had been sealed off, and staff who had turned up in the morning had been told to go home. A letter sent by managers to guests said they had to stay in their rooms.“H10 Hotels has implemented all health and operational recommendations from the health authorities to ensure the safety and wellbeing of customers and employees,” the hotel said.“Additionally, we are providing customers and hotel staff all the necessary care and attention so that, despite the inconveniences this situation may cause, they are taken care of in the best way possible.”Another British guest told Reuters he was among those in quarantine and complained of a lack of information.“We can see from the window there are security officers outside the hotel and about 50 hotel employees,” Christopher Betts said on the phone from his hotel room, adding that guests were asked to remain in their rooms.Betts said they had been allowed to have breakfast in the hotel restaurant but added: “We have received no information whatsoever.” He said he had not been tested for the virus.Ashotel, the association of hoteliers on Tenerife and four other Canary islands, called for calm and said the established protocols were in effect.“The hotel where the affected tourist was staying is doing everything it can to deal with the situation and is demonstrating complete responsibility and following all the steps laid out in the protocol,” said a spokeswoman.“The situation inside the hotel is normal all the customers are being kept informed about what’s going and are cooperating fully when it comes to following the recommendations laid out by the authorities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/055010efde9f28c83d4468d9b51460a41c2ec541/0_89_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e3f3a3faa65f31f7cbdccd29a43015a","title":"what is coronavirus symptoms wuhan covid 19","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the Covid-19 virus from Wuhan in China, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.UK Chief Medical Officers are advising anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and who is experiencing a cough or fever or shortness of breath to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 25 February, the outbreak has affected 80,000 people globally. In mainland China there have been 2,663 deaths among 77,658 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei. More than 12,000 people affected in China have already recovered.The coronavirus has spread to at least other 30 other countries. The most badly affected include Japan, with 850 cases, including 691 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, and four deaths. Italy has recorded 229 cases and seven deaths, while South Korea has recorded 893 cases and eight deaths. There have also been deaths in Hong Kong, Taiwan, France, Iran and the Philippines.There have been 13 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.No. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76bb18bd62d34a6ab693ee2c62563892df9154e1/0_294_8186_4915/master/8186.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f14a7cb754b659803043e879680e9cfa","title":"lie flat beds in economy class air new zealand skynest bunks budget travellers","story":"Airline which operates some of world’s longest flights is considering ‘Skynest’ sleep pods with pillows, sheets and blankets Air New Zealand has announced it could have flat beds in economy for some of its long-haul flights, but it will be more than a year before customers could get the chance to sleep in one of the new pod beds.The airline said on Wednesday it had filed patent and trademark applications for what it is calling the Economy Skynest. The Skynest would contain six full-length sleep pods at 200cm long and 58cm wide each. There will be three levels of beds and two beds on each level.Accompanying each bed, which resembles a pod hotel design, will be a full-size pillow, sheets and blankets, ear plugs, and a privacy curtain. Air New Zealand was still assessing whether it could include other features like a USB outlet and a reading light.The company’s chief marketing and customer officer, Mike Tod, said in the announcement that the product would be aimed at some of Air New Zealand’s longest haul flights, including the Auckland to New York service launching next year – the flight takes 17 hours and 40 minutes.Tod said when that route launches Air New Zealand will make a decision on whether to go ahead with the Skynest.The cost of the Skynest for customers has yet to be determined, a spokeswoman for Air New Zealand told  Australia, but it would be separate to the cost of booking a seat on the flight.“The concept is designed as a pod you go to during the flight,” she said. “You will still have your economy seat separately for the other portion of the flight.”Customers could book a session in the bed during the flight, rather than the whole flight, the spokeswoman said, and the cabin crew would change and freshen up the pods with new bedding for each session.The airline would need to get it certified with regulators before passengers can expect to climb into the in-air beds.“But it was a prize worth chasing and one that we think has the potential to be a game-changer for economy class travellers on all airlines around the world,” said Air New Zealand’s head of airline programmes, Kerry Reeves.If the product takes off, Air New Zealand has said it is open to licensing the Skynest to other airlines.The Auckland to New York flight results in 650kg of CO2 emissions per passenger, according to the UN’s carbon emissions calculator. Air New Zealand had not immediately responded to a request to confirm the amount.Qantas has indicated its economy seats for the A350, which will be used for the mega long haul flights launching in 2023 between Sydney and London and Sydney and New York will be a bit more roomy with an extra 3cms in width than the current economy seats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64baf8751f6d1a912ed40bded28879bc1d840c5e/0_448_3140_1885/master/3140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03d88083d056e01f7d4852beb4bcd4f2","title":"wednesday briefing viral alarm spreads through europe","story":"Government considers school closures and travel restrictions … fractious Democratic debate in South Carolina … and Westminster’s secret doorHello, I’m Warren Murray with your automatic update for Wednesday.Schools could close and travel around the UK might be restricted under stepped-up government plans to deal with the coronavirus as its spread accelerates across Europe.

The tax and spending thinktank says the government is on track to borrow about £63bn next year – £23bn more than the most recent official forecasts. It says the Tories are heading towards breaking their election pledge to balance day-to-day government spending with tax income by the middle of the current parliament. To help balance the books Sunak could abolish entrepreneurs relief, which costs £2.3bn and only benefits as few as 5,000 iniduals, and reform council tax to target the most expensive homes, says the IFS.

Photograph: Laura HuttonThird-level colleges will have to provide drug and alcohol-free student accommodation and provide on-campus social spaces without access to drink under a new Government health initiative.The measures are contained in a “framework on tackling substance abuse” which was sent to the presidents of all higher-education institutions in recent days.The move follows concern over drug use among young people following the deaths of a number of college students from suspected overdoses in recent years.Last year, Minister of State for Higher Education Mary Mitchell O’Connor convened a “rapid response group” – including academics, gardaí, students and first responders within institutions – to devise an action plan to deal with substance abuse on college campuses. She said the actions she is asking colleges to take on foot of this will ensure “all of our institutions have robust policies” to tackle these issues.Ms Mitchell O’Connor said third-level institutions have a responsibility to promote and protect the health and wellbeing of students. “The harm experienced by some students through the use of illicit drugs is a threat to their success,” she said.The group’s report highlighted a lack of a sector-wide approach to the issue within higher education. FrameworkThese findings have fed into the new framework which sets out key recommendations. They include a requirement that each college should gather data on drug use on an ongoing basis to provide a longitudinal look at the scale of the problem. In addition, each college should develop its own drug and alcohol policy, along with an action plan to be overseen by a senior officer of the institution. Other recommendations are that colleges should provide drug and alcohol-free student accommodation and social spaces allocate space for support groups working with those struggling with drug and alcohol abuse consider safety issues such as potential drug and alcohol use while planning all large-scale student events provide counselling services, along with accessible pathways for addiction assessment and treatment services for students and provide training for staff and students in how to deliver constructive advice – or “brief interventions” – to students on these issues.Ms Mitchell O’Connor said the data-gathering exercise will represent the “largest most comprehensive sector-specific data gathering on the issue of drug use in higher education in Ireland”.A total of 14 higher-education institutions have already signed up to take part in the survey. The Minister has funded a research group from University College Cork led by Dr Michael Byrne, head of the college’s student health department, to conduct the research. “This will be a sector-specific, in-depth look at drug use and indeed non-use, among our students, looking in particular at their motivation to use and not to use drugs, the adverse consequences suffered, their willingness and capacity to change their drug use or to remain abstinent as well as the impact drugs have on their academic experiences,” she said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing.

We’re in a containment state, it’s not possible to stop every case but we need to take all reasonable measures,” said Minister for Health Simon Harris on Tuesday evening, shortly after announcing his officials’ recommendation that the rugby international be postponed.However, the Irish Rugby Football Union declined to accede to the recommendation last night, saying it first wanted an urgent meeting with Mr Harris “as to the specific reasoning for the cancellation”.While Mr Harris said “no definitive viewpoint” had been reached by the National Public Health Emergency Team * on other mass gatherings, officials plan to liaise with the organisers of larger events in the coming days, he said. An expert group is to be set up to risk assess events on public health grounds, based on internationally-accepted criteria.The decision on the rugby international was based on the “rapidly evolving nature of the outbreak in northern Italy, and the consequent risk of importation of cases into Ireland, were the match to go ahead”, said Dr Tony Holohan, chief medical officer in the Department of Health.Italy has reported more than 300 cases of coronavirus and 11 deaths in the northern part of the country in recent days. The virus has also been exported from Italy to neighbouring countries and to Spain.The Department of Foreign Affairs is to update its travel advice following the emergency team meeting on Tuesday. Whereas existing advice on travel to affected areas had been confined to China, this will now extend to Japan, Hong Kong, Iran, South Korea and the four regions of Italy that are the subject of restrictions imposed by the Italian authorities.Amid rising public concern over travel to Italy, particularly in relation to school ski groups that have returned recently from the north of the country, Mr Harris emphasised that there is no “blanket requirement” on people who are well and have returned from affected areas to self-isolate.What are the symptoms?Referring specifically to people returning from affected regions of northern Italy, Dr Holohan said GPs were equipped to assess each case and to progress to testing if necessary.“Anyone who has been to the affected regions in northern Italy – Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont – in the last 14 days and has a cough, shortness of breath, breathing difficulties or fever should self-isolate and phone their GP immediately.“Anyone who has travelled from the affected regions in northern Italy and has no symptoms should visit hse.ie for advice.”A number of Irish citizens in Tenerife have contacted the Department of Foreign Affairs after a hotel on the island was placed under quarantine when an Italian doctor staying there tested positive for the virus.Restrictions are in place at the H10 Adeje Palace hotel, with some 1,000 tourists staying at the complex not allowed to leave. The department said it is providing consular assistance. It said the Irish Embassy in Madrid is “closely monitoring the situation” and is in touch with the local health and tourist authorities."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4183106.1582664005!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"could ireland put towns under lockdown if coronavirus arrived","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tItalian carabinieri officers stand guard outside a town closed by the government due to coronavirus. Photograph: Guglielmo MangiapaneReuters Italy has responded to the arrival of multiple cases of coronavirus by putting towns under lockdown, closing schools and sending restaurant customers home early. Could the same happen in Ireland if the disease were to arrive?Ireland is currently trying to prevent the spread of Covid-19 to these shores, it seems successfully so far. Therefore, the situation is quite different from that in Italy, for now at least, where 270 cases and seven deaths have been reported.Yet even in this containment phase, the cancellation of mass gatherings in the State “may be justified in exceptional circumstances”, according to a technical report on measures to delay and mitigate the coronavirus drawn up by the European Centre for Disease Control.It gave the example of large conferences with a significant number of participants from a highly affected area, but says the decision to cancel will need to be co-ordinated with the organiser and public health authorities on a case-by-case basis.During a containment phase, school closures “are not justified”, the document states. “There are also no data to support informed decisions on proactive school closures in terms of their anticipated effectiveness in mitigating the ... epidemic, due to the unknown level of transmission of this virus among children.”However, should transmission of the virus become widespread, school closures “may be necessary”, even though they probably will not reduce the impact of the epidemic, according to the European Centre for Disease Control.Existing powersSuch is the guidance on which Irish public health authorities are relying. The other issue is whether they actually have the powers to enforce restrictions on people’s movement if deemed necessary.The short answer is that they do, though these powers are spread across a variety of public health and public order laws and regulations.Covid-19 is now a notifiable disease, under regulations signed by Minister for Health Simon Harris last week. This means, for example, a doctor has the power to detain a probable case of infection where a person refuses to comply with infection prevention and control protocols.“The foot and mouth scare some years ago was a good example of gardaí regulating traffic movement to protect against the threat.”However, Prof Walsh believes the threat posed by the coronavirus represents “a wholly novel situation for which there is no bespoke legislation in place”.“Given that a Government-imposed lockdown on the movement of peoples in or out of a town (or prohibition on mass gatherings such as a concert or sports fixture) would constitute a serious encroachment on the constitutionally protected fundamental rights of the inidual, I would expect the Government would seek to secure the enactment of emergency legislation giving it the powers to take such measures.”Such legislation would benefit from the protections against constitutional review in the courts if adopted pursuant to a constitutionally declared emergency, he says.Travel restrictionsThe European Centre for Disease Control document says broad domestic travel restrictions may have a small positive impact in delaying an epidemic only if they are implemented at an early stage.“Such restrictions may be effective in specific, isolated settings, but are unlikely to have significant impact on transmission in modern, mainly urban societies within the EU,” it says.“They are expected to have significant economical, legal and ethical implications. Therefore, such restrictions may be considered only during the containment phase of epidemics of high severity.”According to Dr Eoin O’Dell, a law professor at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland enjoys a greater freedom than many other countries in Europe in terms of imposing restrictions on movement between states because it is not a signatory to the Schengen Agreement, which removed border controls between many EU states.However, with post-Brexit UK introducing measures that are at variance with the EU’s, there may be a disparity in approaches on either side of the Border in Ireland, and this could prove problematic."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4184783.1582664144!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irfu seek meeting over call to postpone ireland italy match","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Ireland head coach Andy Farrell and Jonathan Sexton at Avivia Stadium, Dublin which was due to host the Italy clash on March 7th. Photograph: Reuters: Ian WaltonFile PhotoThe Ireland versus Italy rugby international should not go ahead next month due to the risk posed by the coronavirus, Minister for Health Simon Harris has said.The Department of Health’s National Public Health Emergency Team recommended the game’s postponement at a meeting on Tuesday afternoon.The Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) said it was seeking “an urgent meeting” with Mr Harris “as to the specific reasoning behind calling for the cancellation of the Ireland v Italy Six Nations fixture in the context of the Government’s overall travel policy to and from Italy and other affected countries. “Until such time as the IRFU has had contact with the Minister and gets an understanding of the government’s strategic policy on travel to and from Ireland and the cancellation of mass gatherings, it is not in a position to comment further.”Mr Harris said it was the clear view of the team that the match should not proceed on public health grounds, with a large number of people due to travel. He said his officials would be contacting the Irish Rugby Football Union in relation to its recommendation.The advice was based on the “rapidly evolving nature of the outbreak in northern Italy, and the consequent risk of importation of cases into Ireland, were the match to go ahead,” Dr Tony Holohan, chief medical officer in the Department of Health, said.Italy has reported over 300 cases of coronavirus and 11 deaths in the northern part of the country in recent days the virus has also been exported from Italy to neighbouring countries and to Spain.The Department of Foreign Affairs is also to update its travel advice following the NPHET meeting for a number of areas affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Whereas existing advice on travel to affected areas has been confined to China, this will now be extended to Japan, Hong Kong, Iran, South Korea and the four regions of Italy that are the subject of restrictions imposed by the Italian authorities.Other mass gatherings will be risk assessed based on criteria to be developed by a newly-formed expert group, NPHET also decided. These criteria will be based on guidance from the European Centre for Disease Control and the World Health Organisation.Mr Harris said there were also plans to step up visibility of checks on passengers at airports and ports, as well as in schools and public offices, immediately in order to counter the threat posed by the virus.Ninety people have so far been tested for suspected coronavirus in Ireland and all have tested negative, the Minister also said.There may well be a case of the virus in the coming days, he acknowledged.The advice for travellers who have been in any of the newly-extended affected regions in the last 14 days, and who is experiencing symptoms, is to self-isolate and call a GP if experiencing symptoms. Where people have been in the affected area and are not experiencing symptoms, it is recommended they visit hse.ie for advice.Referring specifically to people returning from affected regions of northern Italy, Dr Holohan said GPs were equipped to assess each case and to progress to testing if necessary.“Anyone who has been to the affected regions in northern Italy - Lombardy, Veneto Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont - in the last 14 days and has a cough, shortness of breath, breathing difficulties or fever should self-isolate and phone their GP immediately. “Anyone who has travelled from the affected regions in northern Italy and has no symptoms should visit hse.ie for advice. “The most important measures people can take to protect themselves from the virus are regular handwashing and good respiratory hygiene, he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4184908.1582665931!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish children with faulty spinal support rods may need them removed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘There is no advantage to leaving it in and there are many advantages to taking it out.’ Photograph: iStockAn audit is under way to identify Irish children with severe scoliosis who were fitted with a particular type of titanium spinal support rod, which may now need to be removed.Irish surgeons have been contacted about faults in the Magec System Model X rods, which are implanted in children as young as two years, and are designed to support spinal growth and protect lung development.The number of Irish patients affected is not yet known, although US manufacturer NuVasive confirmed to The  that the product has been in use here.

File photograph: Tolga AkmenAFP via GettyFormer British Conservative Party chairman Chris Patten says he is “amazed” that the UK government regards a “level playing field” with the EU as “an impossible idea”.Speaking after delivering a lecture in Dublin on the risks to liberal democracy, the UK’s former EU commissioner, who opposed Brexit, said the UK insisting on environmental standards in food production amounted to a level playing field.“When we say in Britain that we don’t want chlorinated chickens, that is because we want level playing field with the US for production of chickens,” he told an audience.Mr Patten said that to renew international cooperation in trade countries had to commit themselves to “an extension of level playing fields”.The EU and UK are on a collision course in the upcoming trade talks with Brussels insisting that London agree to a level playing field to ensure the UK will not undercut the EU on standards.Downing Street rejected the EU’s call on Tuesday for a level playing field, saying that Brussels was making unreasonable demands on Britain that it had not made of other trading partners.British prime minister Boris Johnson has insisted on breaking free from EU rules post-Brexit.History and Sinn FéinMr Patten was asked after his lecture whether he would have concerns about liberal democracy if Sinn Féin were to form part of a government given its past relationship with the IRA. He said he did not think anyone “should hold history against people” but that people should make sure you know what the history was and make “pretty clear minded judgments about why, from time to time, you can put history on one side - not always - but from time to time”.Mr Patten chaired the body more than 20 years ago that transformed the Royal Ulster Constabulary into the Police Service of Northern Ireland. “It is possible to excuse people for what their antecedents might have been and to excuse people for the role that some of them may have played in history but I think it is very important to know what the history was and if you make that decision, to make it cooly and rationally,” he said.In his lecture on the threats to liberal democracy around the globe, the UK’s one-time EU commissioner warned about attacks on democratic institutions and civil society including opposition groups, journalists and universities from the rise of populist leaders around the world. Mr Patten, now chancellor of Oxford University, was speaking on “The Future of Liberal Democracy” at St Ann’s Church on Dawson Street in Dublin city centre in a lecture organised by Studies, the quarterly journal published by the Jesuits.The lecture was delivered in honour of the late businessman and statesman Peter Sutherland whom Mr Patten praised for leading the negotiations that concluded the biggest trade agreement in history in 1993 when he chaired the body that later became the World Trade Organisation. “There has been nothing like it since to change so many lives economically mostly for the better nor does there appear much likelihood of anything like it happening again any time soon,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: AP PhotoPatrick SemanskyThe Democratic presidential candidates bickered and shouted over each other in a series of chaotic exchanges on Tuesday night, in the final debate before the critical South Carolina presidential primary and Super Tuesday contests that could represent a make or break moment for several of the seven candidates on stage.Senator Bernie Sanders, the current frontrunner who cruised to victory in Nevada last week, bore the brunt of criticism from a number of his centrist rivals, including vice-president Joe Biden, former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg and former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg. Mr Buttigieg labelled Mr Sanders a polarising figure in the primary and warned of a race between him and US president Donald Trump: “If you think the last four years has been chaotic, isive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders v Donald Trump,” he said.The Vermont senator quickly acknowledged the heat he attracted, stating wryly: “I’m hearing my name mentioned a little bit tonight. I wonder why.”In one of the earliest fiery exchanges, Mr Bloomberg - who is not on the ballot in South Carolina but is seeking to make gains in the 16 states and territories voting next Tuesday - referenced recent reports to suggest that Mr Sanders’ campaign was benefitting from Russian interference in the 2020 primary.Addressing his response directly to Russian president Vladimir Putin, Mr Sanders said: “If I’m president of the United States, trust me, you’re not going to interfere in any more American elections.”Black votersThe South Carolina primary marks the first vote in the deep south and will see African American voters form a majority of the electorate for the first time.Mr Biden has long courted voters in the black community, touting his record as vice-president to America’s first African American president. But recent polling has suggested that Mr Sanders, buoyed by success in a multicultural electorate in Nevada, is now the frontrunner with black voters nationally.Mr Biden, who holds a slim lead in South Carolina according to recent polling, said he intends to win in the state on Saturday, and pledged to nominate an African American woman to the supreme court if elected. But he also tried to tear strips off Sanders, his closet rival the state.Referencing the 2015 terror attack at Mother Emanuel AME church, which stands a few dozen feet from the debate state in downtown Charleston, Biden pointed to Sanders’ mixed voting record on gun control, and touted his own 1994 legislation implementing five day waiting periods for firearms purchases.Mr Sanders initially tried to pivot to criticizing Mr Biden for his record on trade deals, prompting more boos from the audience, before recanting: “I have cast thousands of votes, including bad votes,” Mr Sanders said. “That was a bad vote.”As with much of the debate there was little follow up questioning after Mr Sanders’ significant acknowledgement, as moderators struggled to keep the candidates from interrupting each other, talking over each other, shouting, and speaking for longer than their assigned time limits.The Trump campaign quickly seized on the disorder, issuing a statement saying: “The Democrat Party is a hot mess and tonight’s debate was further evidence that not one of these candidates is serious or can stand toe-to-toe with President Trump.”Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, a fellow progressive, also took aim at Sanders, saying the pair agree on a lot of things, but that she’d be a “better president”.“Progressives have one shot, and we need to spend it on a leader who will get something done,” Ms Warren said.But Ms Warren also renewed her attacks on Mr Bloomberg over the billionaire philanthropist’s treatment of female employees. Ms Warren, who saw a surge in fundraising after her attacks on Mr Bloomberg at last week’s debate, resurfaced an allegation that Mr Bloomberg had once told a pregnant subordinate to “kill it”.The billionaire former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer, returning to the debate stage as recent polls place him third in South Carolina, was also drawn into an angry exchange with Mr Biden, who questioned his record investing in a private prison company, a move Steyer said he also regretted.In a withering put down, Mr Biden referred to Mr Steyer as “Tommy come lately” as the billionaire pushed back and argued he had done more to support minority communities than the former vice-president.As the debate wound to a close the candidates began to move the focus towards more pointed criticism of the Trump administration, particularly the president’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak.Trump tweetMinnesota senator Amy Klobuchar criticized the administration’s funding cuts to the Centre for Disease Control, the US government agency responsible for helping prevent global outbreaks.She argued that the president “hasn’t really yet addressed the nation on this topic” and urged the administration to work on better quarantine and treatment plans.Shortly after the debate Mr Trump, seemingly listening in to the discussion, tweeted: “CDC and my administration are doing a GREAT job handling Coronavirus?”In 2016, Hillary Clinton won South Carolina with an overwhelming majority against Sanders. That result underlines just how significant a strong showing would be this time around for Sanders who had struggled to attract voters of colour in early states during the 2016 campaign. –  News and Media Read more about the Donald Trump administrationStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Germany tightens carnival security following car attack that injured 61Coronavirus latest news: Hotels in Tenerife and Austria in lockdownComment: Political goodwill is needed from BrusselsComment: Why must BBC dramas engage in \u0026#39woke\u0026#39 tinkering?Eerie calm after 19 killed in India\u0026#39s riots over new citizenship lawBernie Sanders told he is Putin\u0026#39s pick as Democrats pile on front-runner in latest debateSanders under fire and Biden upbeat: Five things we learned from South Carolina Democratic debate Mass coronavirus testing to be launched in Britain to uncover how far disease has spreadUK weather: Rain to bring more flooding as Severn\u0026#39s barriers breached Three motorists a day stranded on \u0026#39dangerous\u0026#39 smart motorwayA\u0026ampE patients being treated in corridors becoming \u0026#39the norm\u0026#39 Seagulls prefer stealing food from humans to finding it, research shows Secret passage built during reign of Charles II discovered during Parliament renovations Single-use plastic sachets should be banned, campaigners urgePop star Duffy reveals she was \u0026#39raped, drugged and held captive\u0026#39 in emotional Instagram postHope at last for chronic coughers as drug trial yields \u0026#39exciting\u0026#39 results\u0026#39Ethical vegan\u0026#39 sacked for complaining about pension contributions, tribunal hearsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/02/18/TELEMMGLPICT000225097601_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"free speech everything generation left wing","story":"When members of Extinction Rebellion vandalised a Cambridge University lawn, authorities simply looked the other way From art galleries and the BBC to Brexit and climate change, you can\u0027t be right unless you\u0027re LeftOne of the things that comes with being privileged and well educated is a certain sense of arrogance in the validity of one\u0027s views. And among the many advantages of living in a democracy is the absolute freedom to express them. Which is all very well, so long as you\u0027re on the right, or in this case the Left, side of the fence. Alas, from where I’m standing, the only place most Conservatives feel they can be honest with their ideologies today is behind the screen at a polling station. From politicians to actors, there is seemingly no limit to the sort of thing you can say in public so long as you’re not a Tory. On the contrary, when Labour MP David Lammy was called out last year for equating members of the European Research Group to Nazis and proponents of apartheid, he reflected that his remarks weren’t strong enough”. A month later, when comedian Jo Brand was responding on BBC Radio 4 to news that a protester had hurled a milkshake at Nigel Farage, she quipped: Why bother when you could get some battery acid? It ruffled a few feathers but was largely taken exactly in the spirit which it was meant: as a joke. But when actor Laurence Fox, appearing in January for the same broadcaster on Question Time, rolled his eyes and dared to suggest that Meghan Markle\u0027s unpopularity in the UK was not all down to racism, the actors\u0027 union Equity declared him as a “disgrace to our industry. Fox announced yesterday that he would be quitting social media, such was the voracity of the backlash. I was unsurprised, therefore, to learn this week of a report that revealed more than 80 per cent of those working in the British arts and culture sector feel unable to air Right-leaning views on politics for fear of being professionally ostracised. ArtsProfessional’s Freedom of Expression survey gathered testimony from more than 500 employees one stating “it wouldn’t be advisable to point out that the arts tend to do well under the Tories,” as an example.Oh yes, art institutions are doing so well, thank you very much, that they\u0027ve been turning down vast sums of money from donors attached to dynasties that don\u0027t fit the PC narrative. The National Portrait Gallery last year refused £1m from The Sackler Trust because of family ties to the manufacture of OxyContin. Months later, protesters pushed Canadian philanthropist  and longtime human rights advocate Yana Peel to step down from the board of The Serpentine over (and if this sounds overly convoluted, it\u0027s because it is) her erstwhile shareholding in a company within the same corporate structure as a fund managed by her husband that owned a share in a company which has been criticised by Amnesty International. She could hardly quit her family, so she left her job joining that 80 per cent of her industry who feel they must keep quiet in the process.Meanwhile the loud and proud social justice warriors - not satisfied with stifling dissent in the art world or digging up lawns in Cambridge as university officials whistle and look the other way - have found something new to boycott in their droves on social media: a brand of aromatic beverage. Why? Because our new Chancellor Rishi Sunak, before he’s even had the chance to do anything remotely controversial, posted a photo of himself with a sack of Yorkshire Tea on Twitter. Just imagine this sort of berserk response coming from the Right, when three years ago Jeremy Corbyn said sneeringly that he’d offer Trump a “cuppa” of the same brand.

So far just nine patients in the UK have tested positive for the virus.However, amid concerns that it may now also be more prevalent in the UK, Public Health England on Tuesday announced that they would begin a surveillance system which will see 600 patients a week tested for the virus.The scheme involving around 100 GP surgeries and 11 hospitals aims to ensure that cases are picked up even if they show few symptoms, and involve patients who have never travelled to “high risk” countries for the virus.Health officials said they it would “not be wholly unexpected” if the tests found new groups of connected cases.In addition to the tests, England’s chief medical officer said health planners were “exploring all the options” as they draw up contingency plans to respond to the spread of the virus. Prof Chris Whitty said the government could order school closures, but added that no such “blanket recommendation” was currently being made. It came as at least 12 schools in the UK closed, or sent groups of children home, after they returned from ski-trips in affected parts of Italy.    He also said restrictions on the use of public transport could be introduced and that entire families could be quarantined if one member was infected if the threat to the UK rises.Health officials are currently modelling the impact of the virus on the NHS, amid concern that a major outbreak could see more than half the population fall ill - including healthcare staff.Prof Whitty said: There\u0027s no secret there\u0027s a variety of things you need to look at, you look at things like school closures, you look at things like reducing transport. The expectation is not that we will do all these things, the expectation is we will be looking systematically, using science, at all the building blocks and balancing the effects against costs to society.Part of Britain\u0027s precautions against the virus has involved setting up \u0027isolation pods\u0027 at every major hospital in the UK in an attempt to keep suspected sufferers away from other patients and staff, as pictured below. But the efforts were mocked when images of a makeshift tent outside Lincoln County Hospital emerged. The tent, which was next to a row of bins, had a phone, a blanket and a plastic chair for patients but no heating or running water.A hospital visitor said the tent looked like something that Bear Grylls would keep in his backpack. NHS England insisted no patients would receive treatment in the pod and that it would be replaced later this week.Meanwhile, Scotland’s chief medical officer warned that mass gatherings could be banned if the virus spreads.Health ministers in Ireland said they would be calling for the cancellation of the Six Nations rugby match due to take place between Ireland and Italy in Dublin this weekend, saying that going ahead would constitute a “significant risk” to the public.  Prof Whitty said that if the virus cannot be contained, delaying the peak of the epidemic until winter is over would be a “very big win”, given current levels of pressure on the health service.He said the speed with which outbreaks are spreading means any treatment will have to come re-purposing existing licensed drugs.Health officials have banned the parallel export of two antiviral medicines, which are currently being tested to treat coronavirus, in a bid to ensure that the drugs are available to tackle the virus if they are found to work. The ban means that the medicines - currently used to treat HIV and malaria - cannot be sold by companies in countries which will pay more for them.Meanwhile, Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow announced that he is in precautionary self-isolation after visiting Iran to cover the country\u0027s election.Snow\u0027s producer and cameraman are also self-isolating after the trip to Iran, although none have shown symptoms.He said that he is not really supposed to congregate with any crowds or go anywhere where there may be people, adding: So that means I\u0027m sitting at home.To be honest, the absolute enormity of the prospect of 14 days hasn\u0027t really hit me.He added: Maybe if you call me again in 14 days you will have a headcase on your hands.On Tuesday, Iran, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Burma were also added to the list of “high risk” countries for coronavirus, for which returning travellers are given clinical advice.The US health secretary said on Tuesday it currently has a stockpile of 30 million surgical masks, when 300 million masks are needed. The Trump administration is seeking approval from Senate for $2.5bn extra funding, as health officials said: “We are asking the American public to prepare for the expectation that this might be bad.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/02/08/TELEMMGLPICT000224069044_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqz8PrEBUoq2NOeDT9dFlgS5zo8_eVaYsgfgaGHBq6Cl8.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"singapore shows stop coronavirus without bringing world halt","story":"The Singaporean response has been hailed as the “gold standard” in tackling the epidemic As I saw on my visit there this week, it is limiting the virus’s spread without paralysing its economyAs a country that finds itself in the eye of the global coronavirus storm, the prosperous island city-state of Singapore might provide some useful tips on how British officials can best contain the outbreak without plunging the entire country into complete paralysis.Singapore, with its large population of ethnic Chinese people, was one of the first Asian countries to be affected by the virus, and is dealing with almost 90 confirmed cases. Moreover, there were significant concerns that it might follow China in being identified as one of the main sources of the outbreak after a British businessman who had previously attended a conference held in the Asian city was identified as Britain’s first coronavirus victim.And yet, compared with the extreme measures that have been taken elsewhere to contain the virus, such as the mass lockdown of entire provinces by China’s communist rulers, Singapore has somehow managed to contain the virus while enabling the vast majority of the country’s inhabitants to continue with their normal daily routines, as I found when I visited the city earlier this week.The key to the country’s ability to reduce the outbreak to manageable levels lies in the government’s early decision to place a strict ban on anyone who has recently travelled to China from entering the country, a move that, at a stroke, limited the ability of potential carriers of the disease to spread the contagion throughout the country.In fairness to the British authorities, they, too, acted quickly to limit the movement of travellers from known areas of infection, such as China’s Wuhan province, with leading airlines such as British Airways imposing a ban on flights to key Chinese cities.But where the Singaporean response – which has been hailed as the “gold standard” in tackling the epidemic by no less an authority than Harvard University – has proved most effective is through the introduction of the basic, common sense measures that safeguard the well-being of ordinary citizens.It is virtually impossible to enter any building in Singapore without being offered a sanitising hand wash, a simple expedient for limiting the spread of the virus. Similarly citizens are encouraged to conduct regular checks of their temperature, thereby making early detection of potential new cases more likely.And when new cases are confirmed, rather than indulging in the type of knee-jerk behaviour that has characterised the reaction of the Chinese authorities to the crisis, the Singaporean authorities simply get in touch with anyone who might have come into contact with the carrier and place them in quarantine.The key lesson, therefore, that Britain and other Western countries could learn from the Singapore model is that it is perfectly possible to implement a number of reasonable and effective measures to prevent the virus from spreading without bringing the entire country to a standstill.There will inevitably be those who would regard the introduction of any measure, from hand sanitisation to temperature checks, as a gross affront to their liberty. Yet, compared with the major disruption to their lives that would be caused if the outbreak developed into a major pandemic, the introduction of simple, but effective measures along the lines of those imposed in Singapore could prove vital to containing the spread of the virus if, as now seems likely, there is going to be a significant increase in the number of cases detected in Britain.That is not to say that everything about the Singaporean response has been faultless. Fears that the authorities were failing to control the virus led to widespread panic-buying, resulting in the shelves in many stores being stripped bare earlier this month.The epidemic is also having a negative impact on the country’s economy, with the government announcing that it is introducing measures to provide financial support to sectors, such as tourism and aviation, that have been worst affected by the outbreak.Yet the economic impact on countries like Singapore would have been far worse had the government not acted to contain the virus while at the same enabling the country to continue to function, a consideration British officials need to take on board as they consider their next steps in tackling the crisis.With billions of pounds having already been wiped off the value of European shares in response to the coronavirus outbreak, health officials need to take care not to make comments that could be interpreted as scaremongering. The recent suggestion by an Oxford University expert on epidemics, for example, that travelling on the London Underground could result in thousands of commuters being infected by coronavirus is hardly the kind of statement that is going to calm the nerves of jittery investors.The key aim of ministers and health professionals alike must be to reassure the nation that the battle to contain the virus is being won, not to conjure up scare stories about a nation facing impending doom because one of its key transport hubs has become an incubator for a deadly virus.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

I wonder why?”The seven candidates traded blows in South Carolina, which on Saturday becomes the next state to make its choice, knowing that Mr Sanders’s hat-trick of securing most votes in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada makes him clear favourite. It meant Mr Sanders received sustained criticism from the six others present - former US vice president Joe Biden, former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, senators Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren and billionaires Mike Bloomberg and Tom Steyer. The attacks started within minutes of the two-hour debate in Charleston kicking off, with Mr Bloomberg, who is spending unprecedented amounts on his bid framing himself as the best-placed moderate, brought up the Russian president\u0027s alleged support for Mr Sanders. Vladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be president of the United States and that\u0027s why Russia is helping you get elected, so you will lose to him,” Mr Bloomberg said, addressing Mr Sanders. The remark, hinting at news which broke last week that US officials briefed the Sanders campaign that Russia was trying to help it, got a reaction. Mr Sanders said: Hey Mr Putin, if I\u0027m president of the United States, trust me, you\u0027re not going to interfere in any more American elections. Mr Biden, who polls suggest is favourite to win South Carolina and reignite his flagging campaign, in part thanks to his support among African-American voters, went after Mr Sanders’s record on gun rights. Referencing a massacre in a Charleston church which left nine dead in 2015, Mr Biden said Mr Sanders had voted five times against the Brady Bill, which established federal background-checks and a mandatory five-day wait for gun purchases in the 1990s. I’m not saying he’s responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon if the waiting period had been what I suggest, Mr Biden said. Mr Biden also challenged Mr Sanders for backing a 2005 law, called Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which made it harder to hold gun manufacturers accountable after mass shootings. Mr Sanders admitted it was a “bad vote”. Perhaps the fiercest and most sustained critiques came from Mr Buttigieg, the 38-year-old who defied expectations with top-two finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire and is arguing he is best placed to beat Mr Sanders to the nomination. He repeatedly accused Mr Sanders of being too factional, saying once: “Look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, isive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders vs Donald Trump.”Mr Buttigieg said at another point: “I am not looking forward to a scenario where it comes down to Donald Trump with his nostalgia for the social order of the 1950s and Bernie Sanders with nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of the 1960s.” Ms Klobuchar, the centrist senator from Minnesota, accused Mr Sanders of “alienating” the winnable Republicans the Democratic Party needs to attract back from Mr Trump in the November election. Even Ms Warren of Massachusetts, who praised Mr Sanders’s progressive policy agenda, questioned his ability to deliver it, saying: “We need a president who is going to dig in, do the hard work, and actually get it done. Progressives have got one shot and we need to spend it with a leader who will get something done.Mr Sanders, in the centre of the stage, issued swipes of his own, accusing Mr Buttigieg of being under the influence of “billionaire” donors and noting Mr Biden’s past decision to vote for the Iraq War.But he largely stuck to a familiar script, warning that the US economy was only working for the one per cent, touting policies such as free government-funded healthcare for all and promising a historic turnout to topple Mr Trump.  It is a message that appears to have resonated, not least with young Democrats, with Mr Sanders winning between 20 and 40 per cent of the vote in early contests. After South Carolina\u0027s primary on Saturday, 14 states vote on ‘Super Tuesday’ three days later. But Mr Sanders was not the only candidate targeted. Mr Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and late entrant, appearing in only his second debate, was again singled out by Ms Warren, whose brutal attacks last week made headlines. She brought up a claim he had once said “kill it” to a pregnant female employee - something he categorically denied - and again challenged him to rip up all his company’s non-disclosure agreements (NDA).Mr Bloomberg said he had ended the three NDAs directly involving him after the last debate. Ms Warren also singled out Mr Bloomberg’s past financial contributions to campaigns of Republicans, including South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham and a candidate who had once challenged Ms Warren herself. “I don\u0027t care how much money Mayor Bloomberg has, the core of the Democratic Party will never trust him,” she said. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wednesday morning news briefing coronavirus mass testing","story":"If you want to receive twice-daily briefings like this by email, sign up to the Front Page newsletter here.

You depend on Nest cameras to keep an eye on your home and the people in it, so of course it’s frustrating when you can’t. For that, please accept my apology, said Rishi Chandra, vice president for Nest, in a post on the company\u0027s help page.We’ve rolled out a fix and most camera services should be working again. Unfortunately, video history wasn\u0027t collected during this incident. If you’re still experiencing any problems, please contact our support team.He said the problem was caused by a scheduled storage server software update that didn\u0027t go as intended and that the company would carefully look across our systems to figure out how to make sure it doesn’t happen again.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In a flash, we had profound new information on the Iron Age Middle East,” said Dr Osborne, who specialises in examining the expression of political authority in Iron Age cities.\u0026nbspHe said it was “a marvellous, incredibly lucky find”.The Oriental Institute’s linguistic analysis suggested the engravings was made in the late-eighth-century BC, which lines up with the time Midas ruled.\u0026nbspThe stone also provides answers for a long-standing mystery: Less than 10 miles to the south of the ancient city is a volcano with a well-known inscription in hieroglyphics. It refers to a King Hartapu, but no one knew who he was – or what kingdom he ruled.University of Chicago\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Even the officers are asking why I’m still here. I was put in here for a flight and I wasn’t on it, so why am I still here?” he said.“They said they’re reviewing certain people’s cases. They don’t even let anyone know whose cases they’re reviewing, what the next steps are, nothing like that. I’m just totally confused. Everyone is asking the same questions.”Mr Davis, who was facing deportation on the basis that he was convicted for robbery 10 years ago under the now-unlawful “joint enterprise” rule – for which he spent two months in prison – said the most difficult thing about remaining in detention is being apart from his wife and daughter.“I’m starting to think my daughter is going to forget me. They came on the weekend and she was acting different like she didn’t know who I was. She knows my voice so I try to speak to her every day on the phone. But it really upsets me. My wife is depressed, it’s taking a toll on her,” he said.“I wake up every morning at 5am just looking at the wall thinking: ‘Wow, is this what life has come to?’ When you don’t know what’s going to happen but they have you here, it’s really frustrating. Since the flight, they haven’t said one word, they haven’t issued one letter or anything. It’s ridiculous.Man who has been in UK since age 11 set to be deportedHome Office deports asylum seekers despite ‘lack of access to justice’Home Office charter flight to Jamaica leaves UK despite court ruling“I’m missing my family.

It feels like they’re trying to hold us in here to give them time to sort out another flight. It’s like they’re trying not to accept it when they’ve lost already.“The worst thing is how my kids are feeling. I normally take them to netball and football. When they go to their games now their friends are asking where I am and they don’t know what to say. I’ve been trying to stay strong but it’s getting harder and harder. You can’t keep people locked in like this.” \u0026nbspBella Sankey, director of Detention Action, said the fact that many of those who were not removed on the charter flight were still detained was testament to the UK’s indefinite detention system.\u0026nbsp“It puts abusive power in the hands of the Home Office, breaks with our best traditions and is deeply un-British. Parliamentarians will have the opportunity to change this when the Immigration Bill is published in a few weeks from now,” she said.Torture victims who have endured slavery escape deportation by hoursA number of people whose removal was cancelled have since been granted bail following intervention from solicitors. One of them was a vulnerable man who was released only on Tuesday despite having been admitted to hospital three times during his time in detention.\u0026nbspGeorgia Banks, a caseworker at Duncan Lewis who worked on his case, said: “The Home Office shamelessly brought him to the airport by ambulance on the night of the flight but the High Court ordered a stay on removal. Today he will be released and be able to return to his family.”On the fact that many remain detained, Ms Banks said: “Without the specialist bail tribunal’s intervention, they remain locked up. There is no lawful basis justifying prolonged detention as their removal cannot take place within a reasonable timeframe.”It comes as The Independent reports that a charter flight to Pakistan is set to leave on Wednesday, with suspected\u0026nbsptorture victims on board. The department went ahead with a separate\u0026nbspcharter flight removing asylum seekers to Europe last week despite a stark warning from immigration solicitors that these iniduals may have been denied access to justice.\u0026nbspA Home Office spokesperson said: “We make no apology for seeking to remove dangerous foreign criminals and will continue to fight robustly to ensure they are removed as quickly as possible.“The legal process for removing these criminals, which has included repeated appeals and judicial reviews, has already cost the British public tens of thousands of pounds.”It said it was still seeking to deport all 25 men who were on the Jamaica flight.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The former New York mayor skipped the first caucus in Iowa and instead campaigned in California on 3 FebruaryThe Vermont senator wasn’t the only candidate who faced sharp attacks on Tuesday night. Elizabeth Warren slammed Mr Bloomberg over a news report that he told a female employee to kill it when she became pregnant. The former New York City mayor denied the allegations, causing Ms Warren to once again call on the billionaire presidential hopeful to release women accusing him of sexual harassment and discrimination from nondisclosure agreements.Never said it, period”, Mr Bloomberg said about the allegations.He was also forced to apologise for off-colour remarks he was reported to have made to female employees, while declining to address Ms Warren\u0027s call that he issue a more wide-ranging blanket release from nondisclosure agreements than the three women he has recently released.Biden, who is relying heavily on his support among African-American Democratic voters in South Carolina, said he was “looking forward” to putting the first black woman on the US Supreme Court during a closing portion of the debate.\u0026nbspThe former vice president, who acknowledged his campaign took a “gut punch” after weak performances in the first-in-the-nation votes, also noted that he aimed to live by the following motto: “When you get knocked down, you get up, and everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity.The debate was at times particularly disorganised as candidates struggled\u0026nbspto talk over each other and moderators failed to control the flow of the conversation.\u0026nbspWho won and lost the latest 2020 debate?The crowd cheered at one point as Mr Biden demanded he be allowed to continue speaking, while other moments offered awkward confrontations between him\u0026nbspand Amy Klobuchar, who waited for the former vice president to be finished interrupting her before finishing her answer to a question.\u0026nbspRecent controversies over Mr Sanders’ statements about the education programme in Cuba and Mr Bloomberg’s tax returns were also addressed, as both candidates once again went on the defence.\u0026nbspMr Sanders said it\u0027s possible to oppose authoritarianism and still acknowledge good things such governments have done, while Mr Bloomberg said he was working on readying his returns for release as fast as we can”.In last week\u0027s debate in Las Vegas, Mr Bloomberg said that it takes a long time to compile his tax returns because he makes a lot of money and can\u0027t go to TurboTax”.Mr Bloomberg runs a financial data and media company. He is worth an estimated $60bn.All the other contenders on stage have released their tax returns. The other billionaire in the debate, California climate activist Tom Steyer, noted that he had released a decade\u0027s worth of tax returns.The former New York City mayor also opened himself up to attacks when he discussed spending $100m\u0026nbspto help Democratic candidates flip US House seats held by Republicans.\u0026nbspHe began to say I bought”, before catching himself and saying I got them”, noting their elections helped Nancy Pelosi become speaker of the House.Donald Trump\u0027s campaign spokesman and eldest son were among those on Twitter highlighting the flub.Donald Trump Jr\u0026nbsptweeted: Wow!!! He\u0027s admitting he BOUGHT those seats!\u0026nbspMeanwhile, Bloomberg advertisements were featured during the first two commercial breaks of the debate ahead of Saturday\u0027s primary.The Bloomberg ads highlighted his experience in the business community and as mayor, and they outline some of his key policy proposals. They also featured reporting that claimed Mr Trump was wary of Mr Bloomberg\u0027s rise in Democratic polls.Mr Bloomberg has spent more than $500m\u0026nbspof his own money on his presidential campaign in the last three months.Additional reporting by APShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Boris Johnson must know this is his one big chance for a bold and imaginative boost to the whole economy.As a senior minister warned on Sunday: “You don’t make the North rich by making the South poor.“Nor did the Red Wall ­collapse because those new Tory voters wanted more socialism.”Sunak’s first Budget should be the single most ­dramatic moment of the early Johnson era, setting Brexit Britain’s course as a sovereign trading nation.March , , must stand comparison with the stunning Tory Budgets of Geoffrey Howe in  and Nigel Lawson in  — both high water marks in the fortunes of post-war Britain.Otherwise, what was the point of the bombshell Cabinet shake-up that toppled Sajid Javid and sent shockwaves through our mandarin-dominated Whitehall machine Budget Day is an unrepeatable chance to show that UK plc is open for business — and begin repairing the damage inflicted by previous Chancellors.It’s no good saying Sunak had only four weeks to rewrite Javid’s tax and spending plans.What is the point of a whizz-kid with all those Goldman Sachs-charged brain cellshe can’t deliver the revolution we need This opportunity — more or less marking Boris Johnson’s first  days since the election — will not come again.If the Treasury has been doing its job, it will have drafted contingency plans for every possible challenge — tax cuts, spending leaps, higher thresholds or merging income tax with National Insurance contributions.It will have cost-and-benefit assessments for all eventualities, from a new p top rate to picking cities like Liverpool, Belfast and Glasgow as job-magnet freeports.The Treasury has a blinkered view about tax. It is a means of raising money, on a one-way ratchet.The Treasury does not do “dynamic” economics — lowering taxes and leaving voters to splash their newly acquired cash.This is where Sunak can earn his spurs as an innovative, daring, free-thinking Treasury boss. Stamp duty tops everyone’s calls for reform.George Osborne’s loathed property tax hike paralysed the housing market, locked up billions in hoarded capital, destroyed job mobility — and reduced Treasury revenues.Cutting stamp duty would instantly free up spending and boost the whole economy — especially for tradesmen and the hard-hit High Street.Speaking of shops, business rates need drastic reform to save our shuttered town centres. Why not tax the property owners instead of their struggling tenant shop-keepers All these measures would boost productivity — the amount we earn as a country for every hour worked.Ours is woeful. The average French worker produces more in four days than we do in a full week.Firms have learned to rely on cheap foreign labour, subsidised by taxpayers with welfare top-ups.Home Secretary Priti Patel’s immigration shake-up will cut the flow of cheap labour and force firms to pay proper wages for low-paid care home and service industry workers.The Chancellor can also help by reforming the Factory Tax and encouraging firms to invest in new machinery and technology — the key to economic growth.Whatever Sunak does on March , his duty is to make sure Britain is braced and ready for Brexit.Whatever he does will upset the critics. Sir Geoffrey Howe’s revolutionary  Budget was denounced by  “top” economists in The Times.In , the SNP’s Alex Salmond was booted out of the Commons for heckling Nigel Lawson’s tax-slashing measures.Together those controversial budgets cured Britain as the Sick Man Of Europe and began  years of unbroken economic growth.We need Rishi Sunak to walk in their giant footsteps and turn Britain into the offshore economic dynamo so feared by our erstwhile European partners.It has bluffed its way through the past few decadesby posturing as an integrated political and economic colossus.In reality, like the Wizard Of Oz, it has concealed its naked corruption, barefaced greed and brazen incompetence behind a curtain of bluster and denial.Britain was always there to impose reality on this world of self-delusion. Now we are heading for the exit, taking with us our £billion a year in hard currency.The long predicted End of Empire is about to begin.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We don’t like being treated as fools.If Harry and Meghan wish to be private citizens leading a quiet le in Canada, that’s fine. But that is not their ambition.By trading on their royal associations, they aim for global influence, wealth and fame. It is a goal that makes a mockery of all their protests about their need for privacy.When the Duke and Duchess first announced in January that they wanted to “step back” from public le, there was widespread sympathy for them.Their complaints that they struggled to cope with the limelight appeared convincing, particularly given Prince Harry’s admission of his mental health problems, fuelled by the trauma of his mother’s tragic death in .But that spirit of understanding is quickly evaporating as the couple reveal the full extent of their sense of entitlement and hostility towards the palace.In response to their ening catalogue of invented grievances, many Brits will be inclined to say, “Oh give it a rest,” or “good riddance.”Patience with the couple is at an end.The last straw was their outrageous reaction to the Queen’s decision that they would no longer be allowed to use the term “Royal” in their activities.This move was absolutely correct - the royal name is central to our national heritage.It is not a franchise to be exploited for personal gain, especially by a couple who have loudly proclaimed their determination to abandon their traditional royal roles.Before their wedding in May , they were indignant when the Queen rejected Meghan’s request for the loan of a certain tiara on the big day. “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets,” Prince Harry is reported to have said.But the Queen stood firm, just as she has done in the saga of the royal name.Her fully justied stance has pushed the spite and fury of the Sussexes to a new level, their anger made all the greater by the fact that they had spent thousands on their “Sussex Royal” website and merchandise.Their statements most notorious passage read, “While there is not any jurisdiction by the Monarchy or Cabinet Office over the use of the word Royal overseas, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex do not intend to use Sussex Royal.Who on earth do Harry and Meghan think they are to scold Her Majesty in such a patronising manner The truth is that they are talking political and constitutional nonsense.The monarch and the government certainly do have the right to restrict the use of the word “Royal” throughout the world.Its deployment is covered by a range of legislation like the Trade Marks Act and the Companies Act, as well as a host of international treaties like the  Paris Convention on Industrial Property.But on a deeper, more personal level, the Sussexes’ outburst was a profound insult to Elizabeth II as both our sovereign and a grandmother.Having given her whole le to the service of her country, she did not deserve to be treated like this.Her own example of self-sacrice during her record-breaking  years on the throne is in dramatic contrast to the self-indulgence of the Sussexes, who gave up after just  months.For all their moans about their burden, they never gave royal le as a married couple a chance.Their contempt for the palace shone through other aspects of their extraordinary statement. They wailed that other members of the royal family have been allowed to “seek employment outside the institution,” a blatant jibe at relatives like Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.But the whole point is that Meghan and Harry are not looking for normal jobs.If they were, they would not make such a fuss about their royal associations.Instead, they are hoping to cash in on their positions. That explains why the statement emphasised that Harry is “sixth-in-line to the throne.Without any hint of irony, they also boasted of their wish “to continue to represent and support Her Majesty”, when in reality they have wilfully placed the monarchy in turmoil.But for all the exhausting melodrama they have created, they still expect to be bankrolled by the taxpayer when it comes to their security, whose bill could reach £ million a year.Tellingly, they gave no indication of when they wouldthe £. million paid for the renovation of Frogmore, their property on the Windsor estate.All their laments feed into their carefully cultivated narrative of victimhood - but this is another invention.When they were first married, they were shown tremendous goodwill by the public and the media.Indeed, Kate Middleton had to put up with far more criticism when she first entered the royal family, partly because – unlike Meghan – she did not have her own successful career, and partly because of her middle-class background as the daughter of a former air hostess.“Cabin doors to manual,” snobbish courtiers allegedly sniggered behind her mother’s back.Yet through her modesty, determination, and elegance, the Duchess of Cambridge has grown into one of the monarchy’s greatest assets.“All the film people in the world, had they scoured the globe, could not have found one so suited to the part,” said Prime Minister Winston Churchill in  when the radiant Queen Elizabeth ascended to the throne.

Thats the food for the yeast.He said thatshe hadnt been a candidate for a liver transplant - and required to undergo urine testing - the disorder may have never been discovered.Doctors prescribed the woman with oral antungals to get rid of the yeast infection, which will hopefully allow her to have the much-needed op.It is caused by an overgrowth of yeast in the gut that turns excess carbs from food into booze.The booze in then absorbed into the blood stream and sufferers become drunk.As the condition is so rare very little is known about it and it is not widely recognised.Because of the nature of the condition people are mistaken for closet alcoholics.Those who have the condition may appear drunk, sweaty, confused and have less coordination after eating a meal that triggers an episode.As the condition is so rare a cure is not yet known, but antungal medications to control the growth of yeast in the stomach are thought to help.While the woman is the first to have bladder fermentation syndrome, there have been a handful of other similar cases affecting the gut.Known as auto-brewery syndrome , its usually caused by yeast accumulating in the intestines after ingesting sugar.It can cause sufferers to feel intoxicated and unable to perform simple tasks.In , a man from North Carolina was reportedly charged with drink driving due to the extremely rare condition.The unidentited -year-old had been pulled over by police and breathalysed - with the results showing he as five times over the limit.He argued that he hadnt consumed any alcohol but cops - and his family - refused to believe him.It was until  that he was diagnosed with ABS when tests revealed that every time he consumed carbohydrates his blood alcohol level shot up.Medics treated his gut microflora with a combination of anti-fungal therapies and probiotics.His condition is understood to have been triggered by a course of antibiotics prescribed in  for an injury to his thumb.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At the same time Canada is some  km away. It’s clear that the rules cannot be the same. It’s logical, it’s simple.”He added: We are ready to offer a high ambitious trade deal to the UK. But the UK cannot expect high quality access to the single marketits not prepared to accept guarantees that competition remains open and fair and free.There must be a robust level playing field.He accused the UK of putting unnecessary time constraints on the negotiations.The pressure is not being put by us. The British government is putting the pressure of time on these negotiations.Brussels and Britain only have  months left to strike a deal before the UK leaves on December , , and Boris has pledged not to extend the transition period.The EU tried to tell the UK to fall into line, and agree to to a level playing field which would require Britain to follow the rules set out by the bloc once the transition period ends.Despite saying Britain should be able to keep autonomy over trade, they laid out demands stopping the UK from setting their own tarfs or charges on goods coming into the country for the Union.French EU Minister Amelie de Montchaline said France would not accept any trade deal where the UK doesnt follow EU rules.She said this morning: The UK is a sovereign country... but when products leave the UK and want to enter the EU, its up to us to decide.The UKs proposals for trade talks have been signed off in Cabinet but wont be published until Thursday.The mandate from the EU also demanded access to the UK fishing waters - a position the PM is unlikely to consider.Eurocrats insisted fisherman from member states should still be allowed to fish in British waters even after the transition period.They said the UK should uphold continued reciprocal access to avoid economic dislocation.The PM has already slapped them down over the hated Common Fisheries Policy which Brexiteers are determined to scrap it.Boris spokesman said: TheCommittee has just approved the UKs negotiating mandate. It was a very smooth process to agree our approach which will restore our economic and political independence.The UKs primary objective in the negotiations is to ensure that we restore our economic and political independence on January  .The PMs promise to leave the single market and customs unions would be scuppered by the EUs attempts to enforce the level playing field.Boris has said repeatedly the UK would not be a rule taker in the future relationship.Trade: The UK should fall into line, keep tarrfs of European goods and follow EU regulations on food standardsCourts: European courts would still have some say over the decisions made by British courtsThe bloc is also trying to make Britain follow their standards on issues such as chlorinated chicken - a potential flash point for a trade deal between the US and the UK.Boris has said he will hold discussions for a US-UK trade deal at the same time as he thrashes out an agreement with the EU.The PM will be careful not to put a deal with the US in jeopardy by signing up to restrictive EU measures.The EU has also tried to tell Britain it should follow standards dictated by the bloc on issues such as state aid, workers rights, environment.Brussels also told the UK they would need to hand power to the EU Court of Justice and away from the British courts.It threatened to halt cooperation on criminal law enforcementthe UK refused to abide by the European Convention of Human Rights.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An inanimate object consisting of mesh and leaves bore the full, bilious brunt of virtue-signalling nastiness from those who have probably also been hash-tagging the crap out of #bekind for the past week.“If I was Yorkshire Tea I’d be very worried about my supporters all being racist Brexiteers — perhaps their super-Brit TV ad is responsible ” said one of the politer posts. Others advocated that the brand should be boycotted.A spokesman for Yorkshire Tea responded: “On Friday, the Chancellor shared a photo of our tea.Politicians do that sometimes . We weren’t asked or involved — and we said so the same day. Lots of people got angry with us all the same.”That’s because trolls aren’t interested in the whys, wherefores or, quite frankly, any context at all.They’re simply virtue-signalling from a position of self-bestowed righteousness to try to give meaning — via their target’s legion of followers — to their own sad existence.Yorkshire Tea’s response was impressively measured, but the last line has all of us thinking: “Who are these worrying idiots ”Last week it was reported that actor Freddie Fox was spat at in the street because of something his cousin Laurence said on the BBC’s Question Time.His cousin. Not even Laurence himself, who, by the way, should also be able to walk the streets without fearing physical or even aggressively verbal repercussions from someone who simply disagrees with his opinion.When moronic irrationality is restricted to the echo chamber of Twitter, it can be switched off and ignored.But when it spills out of the Twittersphere and impacts on a victim’s family or livelihood, then surely society as a whole must unite to stop it Because, one day, it could be you. Or, worse, your children.Former Met detective Philip Grindell was called in to help politicians deal with online abuse, which rose by  per cent last year.After retiring he helped a “global icon” who was scared for their le.“It was a famous person who was getting death threats,” says Philip, , who has now started a company called Dfuse Global to anticipate and assess the risk of online abuse.He discovered the death threats were coming from someone in the UK who had mental health issues and weren’t considered a risk to the personal safety of his client.Several years ago, Sky News confronted a woman who had repeatedly trolled the McCanns after the disappearance of their daughter Madeleine in .The woman, in her s, who had, “previously grappled with mental illness”, killed herself just days after being confronted.So tackling online trolling is clearly a minefield to navigate, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try.Just because much of it comes from a place of deep sadness or instability in the troll’s le, why should that allow them to inflict damage on other people with impunity This isn’t about disagreeing with someone’s views in a rational, well-argued way.It’s about downright nastiness and threats to someone’s mental or physical well-being. And it needs to be tackled by the State, not just private companies.We have to provide full ID before we board a plane, so why not insist on it when setting up an online account which must include our real name followed by a unique number Then, currently anonymous trolls might think twice before whipping up hate about someone they don’t even know and we can all drink our teain peace.OH gawd, here it comes again – the tyranny of a “no make-up” photo posted by Hollywood glitterati.Stop. It. Now.The latest salvo was fired by Gwyneth Paltrow, who hosted a “natural” dinner party to promote her well-being website Goop and invited, among others, Demi Moore and Kate Hudson.Demi, who has spent £squillion on cosmetic surgery, looked great. As well she might.Equally, I once got in a lt with Kate Hudson, who is quite simply one of the most stunning women I have ever seen.And then we have Gwynnie herself, who has the radiant glow of a woman who spends the national debt of a small country on skin treatments and products.The reality, of course, is that there’s little meaning to this “no make-up” dinner party other than for the attendees to show how great they look.Meanwhile, those dealing only with what God gave them remain judged by the sentiment once expressed by beauty guru Helena Rubinstein.“There are no ugly women, only lazy ones.”THE McDonald’s Quarter Pound- er Fan Clubhas plans to launch a range of candles with smells such as burger, ketchup and onion.That’s as “eeeeeeew” as Gwyneth Paltrow’s Smells Like My Vagina candle.The, er, burning question is: What’s wrong with the old stalwarts of fig or gardenia A FORMER friend of paedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s right-hand woman Ghislaine Maxwell has told the FBI of a potentially relevant conversation they once had.“She said many things . . . ” reveals Christina Oxenburg.“Stuff like: ‘Jeffrey and I have everyone on videotape!’”Interesting.Could this perhaps explain Prince Andrew’s haste to cross the Atlantic and share a walk in the park simply to, he claims, break off the friendship with a man he also claims he didn’t know that well Or was it to find outthere were videos that he should be worried about from his time enjoying Epstein’s hospitality AL PACINO, , has been dumped by his -year-old girlfriend Meital Dohan.“I tried to deny it, but he is already an elderly man,” she says with refreshing candour.“So even with all my love, it didn’t last.”In other words, he’s very set in his ways, probably a little curmudgeonly at times and “the nursing years” are looming.THIS, believe it or not, is former “First Baby” Leo Blair – born when dad Tony was in situ at No Downing StreetIt feels like five minutes ago . . . but he’s now .Reasons to feel old: Part .THE maker of Barbie is bringing out three “inspirational women dolls” in the shape of ex-tennis champ Billie Jean King, hero nurse Florence Nightingale and singer Ella Fitzgerald, complete with “authentic clothing”.Nice idea, but let’s see how it pans out.Chances are they’ll end up in the “Barbie box” with all the others – dressed in a boob tube, sequined leggings and their hair in wonky plaits.Probably because we’d end up with a tuneless busker called Singy McSingface.THE WM Bar-B-Q Burger bar in Honolulu, Hawaii, has been serving its client favourite, the Royal Burger, since .Last time I looked they weren’t locked in litigation with The Queen.That’s because no one in their right mind would ever associate a burger restaurant with the British monarchy.The same, however, cannot be said of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex.One of them was born royal, they both enjoyed a breathtakingly expensive royal wedding, undertook royal dutiesand received money from the Duchy of Cornwall, which the reigning son of the current British monarchinherits.So while Harry and Meghan’s little barb that The Queen doesn’t have legal jurisdiction in the US over the word royal is correct, the notion that their use of the word isn’t inextricably linked to the British crown is patent nonsense and Her Majesty is right to insist they drop it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The mob’s targets know no bounds.  This “woke elite” have made it impossible to have civilised conversation and debate.Take the feminist Germaine Greer, a woman who has fought tirelessly for some  years for women’s liberation. She is now considered by some to be too frightful to listen to and there have been calls to no- her — ban her from speaking at events, usually universities.Even companies such as Yorkshire Tea are getting stick.  The firm was bombarded with complaints at the weekend, with people expressing outrage because the new Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, posted a photo of himself on social media making a cup of tea with the brand.Sunak’s crime is being a Conservative. Yorkshire Tea’s crime was to allow the Conservative Chancel-or to drink its tea. This bizarre, unreasonable, moral crusading of what I see as the “woke elite” is part of the explanation for the Conservative landslide in the last election.In my view, the Labour Party lost  seats, the second largest number it has ever lost in a single election, because ordinary people look at the Left and think they have all gone mad.This isn’t true, of course. It is a great shame for sensible, left-leaning people in Britain that the woke are giving them all such a bad name.Those on the Left must cringe with horror every time there is a Twitter pile-on when someone does some- thing that “offends”.The woke march around asthey are police, bullying everyone into thinking and speaking in a way that they deem to be acceptable.If you don’t agree, they will write to your employer and get you fired, or they will bombard you with abuse until you give in and beg for forgiveness.I should know — it has happened to me more than once. If I tweet something that offends the woke elite, they write to my governing body, Ofsted, demanding my resignation.Luckily, on Twitter one can block these self-righteous radicals, giving oneself some peace. But there was a time when our school received so many savage and bloodthirsty emails that one of my office staff had a breakdown from having to read them all.We have even received death threats. Why  Because the woke elite don’t like how we run our school. As a headmistress, I believe it is important to teach children to hear all sides of any debate and encourage them to form their own, independent views.Butone side is constantly shutting down debate with bullying tactics, no-ing and drowning people out, then how are our children ever to hear both sides When we were first opening our free school, social justice warriors determined to stop us would infiltrate our parent evenings and stand up as I was talking, shouting over me so the parents couldn’t hear what I was trying to say.Why did they do this  Because in  I gave a speech at the Conservative Party conference. I am not a Conservative but that didn’t bother my detractors. As with Yorkshire Tea, simple association with the Conservative Party means you must be evil.The woke cannot imagine that the Conservatives want a better world, just as they do. They simply disagree on how to get there.So frequent and angry have the calls for someone’s dismissal or “cancellation” become that those who would have once argued the case, the “anti-woke”, are just rolling over. It’s not worth the hassle, they say with a sigh.The “anti-woke” weren’t always this way. They are ordinary people who have simply become fed up of being browbeaten by these pseudo-moral liberators.If the woke have something truly interesting to say, then why don’t they make their arguments, stand up on a stage and explain why their beliefs are worthy At least that would have the effect of persuading people, rather than alienating them.  But the woke don’t care about being virtuous. They want only to signal it.In , too many people live in fear of what they can and cannot say.

Anne Giwa-Amu, , suffered a “hostile environment” where staff set out to humiliate her by using racist language like aposP***-loverapos in her presence, the tribunal heard.Ms Giwa-Amu, who is mixed Nigerian and Welsh, endured one DWP official boasting that he had “touched her bum”, the hearing was told.Colleagues at the DWP branch in Caerphilly also repeatedly accused Ms Giwa-Amu of stealing ice cream and used body-spray on themselves while sitting next to her. A  at Cardf employment tribunal awarded Ms Giwa-Amu £, for race and age discrimination. Her compensation included £, for loss of future earnings and £, for injury to feelings, one of the highest ever awards of its kind for harassment. Judge Laura Howden-Evans ruled that Daisy Cartwright and Robert Lewis acted “in an insulting way deliberately intended to humiliate Ms Giwa-Amu and create a hostile environment for her”. Speaking afterwards, Ms Giwa-Amu complained that the pair had not been disciplined and accused the department of promoting a culture of racism. She said: “I am relieved by the tribunal award. The last three years have been a nightmare. “But the employees who were openly hostile towards me because of my colour an age have not been penalised. “They have got away scot-free and in some cases have even been promoted. “When I went to management, they sided with the employees, which created an unbearable situation. “These people assess benefits claims for ethnic minority claimants, which is a very worrying situation. “They have all had ersity training but it has had no impact on them because their racism is ingrained.  “Management is paying lip service to the equality legislation. By protecting offenders, the department is promoting a culture of racism. “The institution has now been held accountable and will pay my award but the employment tribunal should be given more powers so the perpetrators can be penalised too.” Ms Giwa-Amu, of Caerphilly, was born in Wales but has a Nigerian father and grew up there. She had previously iously worked as a CPS case worker, solicitor and oil company director and the tribunal found she was a very capable lady. She joined DWP as an admin officer in February  after an unsuccessful attempt to start a small business. She was the only non-white recruit of nine new trainees and the only one aged over , the tribunal heard. Within five weeks, she made a formal complaint of bullying and racial harassment and was signed off work sick suffering from stress and anxiety. In her first week, Ms Cartwright violated Ms Giwa-Amuaposs dignity by using racist language such as aposP***-loverapos in her presence, the tribunal found. Ms Cartwright also mocked her for complaining that “it always rains in Wales”, telling Ms Giwa-Amu that her “weather report” was racist. Ms Cartwright repeatedly accused Ms Giwa-Amu of stealing ice cream and ignored her request to stop spraying herself and spinning on her chair while sat alongside her.  Mr Lewis, meanwhile, humiliated her by loudly telling the group “I touched her bum. I touched her bum”. Ms Giwa-Amu went on sick leave from her £,-a-year post in  and was unlawfully dismissed in October that year for being unable toto work, the tribunal ruled. It found that without the discrimination, she would have been promoted to the £, role of executive officer the next year and worked in the civil service until her retirement. Instead, Ms Giwa-Amu, who has been unemployed ever since, ran out of money for food after her final pay cheque was withheld. The tribunal noted that despite her best efforts to find a fresh job, Ms Giwa-Amu had received only one invitation to interview. It concluded that at her age, she is over-qualied for many jobs and unlikely ever to work again. The DWP has been ordered to contact the Equality and Human Rights Commission for ersity awareness training and its permanent secretary, Peter Schofield, must directly review her case.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge looked stylish at the special performance of Dear Evan Hansen, held in aid of The Royal Foundation. Kate sparkled with a glittery bag and shoes matching combination - a pair of £ silver Jimmy Choos she has worn before with a brand new £ clutch. The -year-oldaposs dress was custom-made by Eponine in stylish tweed dress while William chose a colourful blue suit teamed with a crisp white shirt and matching tie. William, , and Kate will watch the show and meet members of the cast before the Duke will make short remarks at the end of the performance.The musical, which won six Tony Awards after opening on Broadway in , is about an anxiety-ridden boy struggling to connect in a hyperconnected world. It has been credited with helping parents and their children discuss some of the mental health dficulties facing so many young people in Britain and the western world. Inside the foyer of the Noel Coward Theatre in central London, the royal couple chatted about the mental health theme to the play’s author, Steven Levenson, and composers Justin Paul and Benj Pasek. “Ten years ago, do you think this play would have been here ” William asked. I don’t think it would have even existed, Mr Pasek said. Organisers declined to say how much the show would raise for the foundation’s mental health campaigns, which include the text messaging helpline Shout, William’s Heads Up campaign to use football to persuade fans to talk about their mental health, and the earlier Heads Together campaign. In a programme note, William said: “Catherine and I are delighted to join you this evening for a special charity performance of Dear Evan Hansen at the Noel Coward Theatre.One of the issues that we care passionately about is mental health and we are pleased that Dear Evan Hansen is helping to start important conversations between parents and teenagers about this important subject. Through initiatives including Heads Together and Heads Up, the Royal Foundation is helping tackle the stigma and change the conversation around mental health.

While they plan to continue supporting their existing charities, itaposs believed that they will spend little time in the UK and have axed their Buckingham Palace office. This has lead to speculation about whether they will attend key royal events, including Harryaposs cousinaposs wedding. According to a friend, there is a chance the couple may skip the festivities, which are being held at the Chapel Royal at St James Palace, on May . They told the : Of course Harry and Meghan will still be invited, but itaposs up to them whether or not they choose to attend. The trouble with Harry and Meghan is that they think they are bigger than the institution. Itaposs such a shame things have turned out like this. There is also concern that their appearance - which could be their first in the UK after their move - will create so much excitement that it might actually take attention from Beatrice and Edo.It comes after experts claim the Sussexes made a dig at Beatrice and her younger sister Eugenie in their extraordinary statement detailing aposMegxitapos.Hours after an official announcement on the arrangement were released, the couple shared their own, much longer, message on their personal website. It has been decided that there will be a review of Meghan and Harryaposs set-up after  months - something it seems theyaposre not too happy about.  In their message, they highlighted that other members of the Royal Family have already set a precedent for earning their own incomes. Princess Beatrice and Eugenie are the highest profile examples of this. Beatrice works in finance and consulting, and is currently the vice president of partnerships and strategy at software company Afiniti, while her younger sister is the director of London art gallery Hauser  Wirth. The statement read: “While there is precedent for other titled members of the Royal Family to seek employment outside of the ­institution, for The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, a -month ­review period has been put in place.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum 21 sue radford weeks","story":"NewsMum-of- Sue Radford weeks from number  set to be a grandma againSue Radford, who is pregnant with her nd child, has revealed she is due to be a grandma again making Britains biggest family, based in Morecambe, Lancashire, even largerShareCommentsByJoseph WilkesReporter:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror am celebrity-news video sue-radford-complications-nd-pregnancy-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:,,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news mum--sue-radford-weeks-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Emma Harris had been having a cup of tea with her mum Maxine just hours before she got a desperate call to say she had collapsed after a suspected stroke. Alongside her grandmother and uncle, Emma battled through rush hour traffic at pm and arrived into what appeared to be something out of a scene of a film, and immediately knew this was not good.The -year-old nursing assistant described seeing air and land ambulances, as well as a fire engine at the scene in Kingsway near Gloucester but they were not allowed to see mum-of-three Maxine, reports GloucestershireLive .“When they said that they were working on her, I knew with my training that it was not going to be good,” said Emma, who told a paramedic she worked in care. She went on to plead to know what and later the paramedic ed and told her she could go through to where her mother was. “The paramedic said to me that mum was very poorly and to expect the worst, said Emma. “I went through, knelt by her and they said they were breathing for her. “I said to them that I understood that they had tried their hardest and I appreciated what they have done. She continued: “With respect for my mum I asked them to step back as it was clear that she had enough.” That, according to Emma, is the hardest decision that she has ever had to make. “I had never felt heartbreak like that, she added. Maxine was just  when she died in August last year and Emma and her family now want to raise awareness about cardiac problems, believing potential problems could have been recognised earlier. Now they want to highlight the warning signs to others and tell women that they are just as much at risk as men.  Emma said: “I feel that there needs to be more awareness of heart attacks in women and they are not taken as seriously as men when they have symptoms of a heart problem. “Mum complained of a tight chest however it was put down to her anxiety and depression. “She started at times to get breathless. We were often up with the horses and she found it a struggle to get them in.” Maxine has been described by her daughter as being bubbly and had a massive smile and very active. Emma said: “I am not going to get angry about losing mum. I am going to fight her corner and raise awareness. “The postmortem revealed that she had two blocked arteries. She had been diagnosed with angina but was scared to take the medicine as she was told that she could faint when taking it. “An appointment came through for mum to see the heart team. The first appointment was cancelled and the second one came too late. “If she had seen someone they would have found out what was wrong.” The death of Maxine came as a complete shock to her family. Emma had seen her mother two hours previously at her grandparentsapos house.  There is nothing that could have prepared Emma for what she would have to decide in the early evening of August . She said: “Mum was at her friendaposs house. I had just seen her at my grandparentsapos house that afternoon. “The last thing I remember her saying was what a rubbish cup of tea she was having and said that she had to leave. “I had a call from her friend to say that they thought she was having a stroke. Referring to her familyaposs campaign, Emma went on to say: “We are fighting to raise awareness of heart attacks. Mum definitely brought us up to fight for what is right. “I am meeting with the British Heart Foundation to help boost awareness and make sure that women are aware that they too can have heart attacks at a young age.” Emma will be hosting a black tie dinner and dance to raise awareness of heart attacks and symptoms. This is the first event of many to come in the future. There are some slight dferences that have been reported by women when they are having a heart attack.

The incident happened while the boat was docked in San Juan, Puerto Rico at around .pm on July . Anello initially pleaded not guilty to a negligent homicide charge following Chloeaposs death, but, according to  NBC News, he filed paperwork to change his plea so that he gets a shorter sentence. According to Michael Winkleman, the familyaposs lawyer, the agreement was for the best interests of the family so that they can close this horrible chapter and turn their focus to mourning Chloe.

The ,-capacity MSC Meraviglia is heading for another port having been detained in Ocho Rios since am after red flags were reportedly raised by health inspectors onboard. Reports on the ship suggest Jamaican immigration is currently denying disembarkation after a crew member fell ill on board. The Filipino worker is said to had been in Manila within the last few days. It is currently waiting a mile offshore. after arriving earlier this morning from Miami. Passengers have been seen standing on deck but there has been no confirmed cases detected with one report saying action has been taken as a precaution. Are you on board the cruise ship  Contact webnews@mirror Passenger Laura OaposNeill said she had no idea what was going on until she read aposs story. She told us moments ago: We’ve just been told that we will be departing Ocho Rios since we are not being allowed entry. We have received no communication as to why we are not allowed off the boat except for announcements saying that we are waiting for officials to clear us. This has been going on since am with no additional communication from anyone on board. If it wasn’t for the article, I would have no clue as to what is actually going on. Another woman on board said: Before boarding in Miami our temperatures were taken to make sure.Staff encourages us to clean our hands before entering buffet and restaurants areas.  There are stations with disinfectant in every floor and main areas.  The frustration was palpable amongst us passengers. We were looking forward to enjoying the beaches, the food and the culture. An MSC Cruises Statement read: As is standard practice when a vessel approaches each port of call during a cruise, the ship’s command has to report any illness on board to the relevant local health authorities. Upon arrival this morning MSC Meraviglia reported one single case of common fluaffecting a crew member from the Philippines. The crew member had embarked at the beginning of the cruise in Miami, after passing the mandatory health screening that all of our guests and crew members receive before joining the cruise, a precautionary measure that we have implemented fleetwide. The local port health authority in Ocho Rios today requested further guidance from the National Ministry of Health in Jamaica’s capital of Kingston.  After waiting in port for nearly four hours for formal clearance, ship’s command decided to leave Ocho Rios for the next port of call as the long wait had compromised the passengers’ proposed time at the destination. All MSC Meraviglia’s guests and crew have been screened inidually upon embarkation, both in terms of their travel history as well as their health. MSC Cruises denies embarkation to anyone – crew and guest alike – who has travelled to, from or through mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau, as well as to people who during the past  days have travelled to, from or through any of the municipalities that are subject to quarantine in central northern Italy. In addition to this, all MSC Cruises ships also conduct inidual pre-boarding screening by thermal cameras to identy guests or crew members with signs or symptoms of illness such as fever or feverishness, chills, cough or dficulty breathing.  This will also result in denied embarkation.  The crew member had travelled to Miami from Manila, via direct connection in Istanbul. He developed symptoms of common flu and tested positive to type A influenza after he visited the ship’s   Medical Centre while already on board. He has no other symptoms. MSC Cruises apologises for any inconvenience caused and the disappointment to its guests in connection with today’s missed call due to the delay in receiving clearance. The Jamaican Ministry of Health and Wellnes said in their own statement: A cruise liner with over , passengers and over , crew was denied access to the port of call. It was discovered that a crew member was placed in isolation on board.The crew member had a cough, fever and associated muscle pains with a travel history to a country of interest relating to the COVID-.The MSC Meraviglia was launched in June  and sails to more than  destinations around the world. Global cases of the virus have now passed ,, the vast majority of those in China.  Hours earlier, a hotel in Tenere was been placed on locked down after a visiting Italian doctor and his we tested positive. Guests at the Costa Adeje Palace Hotel are not allowed to leave their rooms. The World Health Organization said on Monday the world should do more to prepare for a possible pandemic. Health Secretary Matt Hancock today said he was not planning a trip to northern Italy as the Government defended its approach to the coronavirus outbreak. People coming back from affected areas have been told to self-isolate but the Foreign Office has not changed its travel advice, meaning flights continue to take Britons to the region. Downing Street insisted its approach was based on medical evidence but stressed that travel advice was kept under review.

Another two tourists were quarantined in hospital after testing positive for the killer virus. An Italian doctor and his we who had been staying at the H Costa Adeje Palace had already been transferred to Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria University Hospital. Two other Italians who were part of the group of  holidaymakers they flew to the island with on February , were quarantined in the same hospital late yesterday after testing positive. News of the fresh cases came as hundreds of tourists were told they must remain in the hotel at the centre of the coronavirus scare. The decision, announced by regional health chiefs and Canary Islands president Angel Victor Torres last night at a press conference, opens up the prospect of British tourists having to spend nearly a fortnight locked in at the H Costa Adeje Palace before the standard incubation period ends. Mr Torres said the “hundred and odd” tourists who had checked into the H Costa Adeje Palace on Monday - and had had no contact with the Italian doctor and his we who tested positive for coronavirus - could leave today. He added: “The others will have to be subject to active inidual monitoring.” Domingo Nunez, head of Epidemiology of the Canary Islands Health Service, defended the decision to keep the hotel on lockdown yesterday after it emerged a guest had tested positive for coronavirus. He said: “We are convinced there wasn’t another option to the measures that were adopted, at least as an initial measure of contention against the spread of the virus. “It was necessary to establish the initial hotel quarantine.” Setting out the immediate future for most of the holidaymakers currently in the hotel, he added: “Guests will have to stay in the hotel without leaving the hotel. “Those who have symptoms will be evaluated and will stay in the hotel without leaving their rooms and depending on the results of the tests and whether they test positive or negative, a further decision would then be taken. “If they tested positive they would be transferred to hospital. “The people who are not showing any symptoms can move freely inside the hotel, although under certain conditions such as using the facemarks which are now available. “But they still won’t be able to leave the hotel. “Once we have new information, we will come to a consensus with the Ministry of Health about what we’re going to do. “But at the moment the situation and the outlook is that people will have to stay inside the hotel.” The group of  Italians the unnamed doctor was part of are expected to be the focus of the medical team that will now remain in the hotel  . Another  Italians staying in the hotel were the next group to be tested for the virus yesterday.  Around  Brits travelling with TUI are known to be in the hotel. Officials say the guests come from  nationalities including Belgians, Dutch and Brits. Since the weekend Spain has gone from having no current confirmed cases of coronavirus to seven - the four in Tenere, one in Barcelona, one in Castellon and another in Madrid. At least five are Italians and the other two are said to have ed to Spain after trips to Italy, where coronavirus has claimed the lives of  people so far. The Tenere hotel at the centre of the coronavirus alert has announced it is closing till the middle of March.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"keep that mojo burning 4 below","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFrom Oban,  Below previously graced the MOJO stage before in  with a blistering set from their debut album Alpha, to great acclaim.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

quick gender change - Ed.And joining them both in a bizarre love triangle is the comedy genius Ross Aitken.With a leaning towards Emo Philips, Ross provides more than a few of the continuous laugh-out-loud moments as Chads side-kick.In Mitchell, Cleland and Aitken, Selkirk Musical Theatre Company has an exciting future.And they also have the equally-talented Ellen McFadzen, Craig Douglas and Amanda Blacklock to provide even more unrequited love confusion.If the lucky ticket holders at this weeks show need any convincing of the depth of talent on the stage they will be blown away as

finances required for a new Peebles High School.Local Conservative council leader Shona Haslam and the local authoritys education portfolio holder Carol Hamilton hit out earlier this month at what they claimed was a financial snub from the Scottish Government.Their claims infuriated Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who reiterated Holyroods commitment to help following the school fire in November.But last weeks budget announcement by the Conservative Independent administration has now sparked a fresh row.According to the figures presented a new Peebles High will cost around pound million - with only pound million coming from an insurance settlement.The claim that there will be a pound million deficit has led to MSP Christine Grahame seeking clarication.The councils chief finance officer David Robertson has confirmed that Peebles High has an insurance value of pound million.And that the local authority is working with loss adjuster appointed by Zurich on a final settlement - expected to be made next month.But the correspondence has now thrown up more questions, with Ms Grahame demanding to know where a pound million deficit will occur.She told us: \"The claims being made by Councillor Haslam and her Tory colleagues are going to be massively concerning for the school community.\"As soon as the scale of the damage from the fire was apparent I wrote to SBC to check that insurance would cover the cost of rebuilding ndash I was told yes, it should.ldquoCllr Haslam has already been caught in one lie by saying the Scottish Government has refused funding for the rebuild when SBC have never requested it. And why would itit was covered by insurance ldquoIs it the case that the insurance company has rejected a claim for new build and will pay only for reinstatement of the damaged areas  If that is the case then she should come clean. She is claiming the school faces a pound million deficit.\"The only explanation I can offer is that this is the cost of replacement of damaged areas but on this Ms Haslam is silent.ldquoI await her response, but in the interim I would ask her seriously to desist in trying to play politics with this to get a disingenuous hit on the Scottish Government and SNP.\"It serves no one and is unnecessarily causing genuine concern amongst the local community when efforts should be going into ing stability and normality to students, parents and staff.Scottish Borders Councils administration has committed to delivering replacement secondary schools in Galashiels, Hawick and Peebles in the next six years.Councillor Haslam believes that an improved replacement school for Peebles school along with using parts of the remaining building needs to be factored in to the calculations.In a response to Christine Grahame, she said: \"As you are well aware the insurance will only pay to replace what was lost.\"This will still result in a music department in a windowless basement and a science department in labs that are not fit for purpose.\"Despite this our school continues to produce first class scientists and musicians but I believe they deserve more and better.\"We had planned to replace Peebles High School in the next  years. To only do part of the school now would be a  economy and impact on future plans to replace outdated buildings.\"I know how keen you are to see a new High School delivered in Galashiels so am perplexed as to why you are so against Peebles getting the same facilities  Perhaps you could clary  I am certainly not satisfied with half measures for our young people.\"We are also extremely keen to ensure that other towns developments are not held back as a result of this fire. So Galashiels and Hawick remain on schedule to be delivered. This means that our Conservative led council will be delivering three new High schools, two new primary schools in the next six years, quite an achievement as I am sure you will agree.\"This is held against the backdrop of a cut to our capital budget this year of  percent.\""},{"url":null,"title":"former-melrose-winger-backs-murrayfield-abseil","story":"A SUPERHERO abseil down the Murrayfield stands has been supported by two Scottish rugby legends.Former Melrose player, Craig Joiner, and Edinburgh attack coach, Duncan Hodge have both backed the superhero feat in aid of Scotlands Charity Air Ambulance .Craig said: \"SCAA is Scotlands only charity-funded helicopter air ambulance and without the support of people such as these abseilers we wouldnt have this vital resource.\"None of us knows when we might need the service and everyone who joins in this fun event at BT Murrayfield should be very proud of their efforts.\"Duncan added: \"Its rare to get the opportunity to abseil from the stands on to the pitch at BT Murrayfield.\"So not only are these fundraisers supporting a great cause, theyre among a very select group of people to add this achievement to their le story.\"The abseil, which is set to take place on Thursday, March , is looking for volunteers to raise at least pound each for the charity before taking part in the Murrayfield touchdown.The  foot drop from the top stands will be where the superheroes take off from, and friends and family come come along to support the abseilers as they descend.Regional fundraising manager for SCAA, Carol Ann McMahon, said: \"SCAAs own heroes are on call every day of the year to fly expert paramedic care to the most sick and injured in our communities and airlt them to advanced hospital care.\"Every superhero who takes on the BT Murrayfield abseil will help ensure this amazing charity stays in the air for those most in need across Scotland and our many islands.\"Borderers who feel up to the super challenge can sign up at https:murrayfieldabseil.eventbrite and pay a pound registration fee."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco-slash-1-800-jobs-bakeries-overhaul","story":"MORE than , jobs are at risk atTesco ndash as part of changes to bakeries in its stores.The supermarket giant, which has a store in Galashiels, has announced , members of staff will be made redundant from May across the country.Tesco will then stop baking bread from scratch in  of its shops.In  stores, only the most popular products will continue to be baked from scratch on site.But the locations of the job losses have not yet been revealed.Jason Tarry, the companys CEO, said: \"We need to adapt to changing customer demand and tastes for bakery products so that we continue to offer customers a market-leading bakery range in store.\"We know this will be very dficult for colleagues who are impacted, and our priority is to support them through this process.\"We hope that many will choose to stay with us in alternative roles.\""},{"url":null,"title":"uk-schools-close-coronavirus-panic-spreads-across-europe","story":"Schools in the UK are taking drastic action to protect against Covid- as the illness continues to spread across Europe amid fears of a global pandemic.Some have closed while others have sent pupils home for fear they may have been exposed to coronavirus during ski trips to northern Italy.It comes as travellers ing to the UK from northern Italy were told they may need to self-isolate as part of measures to stop the spread of illness.# Today @CMO_Englandhas updated advice for travellers ing to the UK from specic areas affected by #COVID.

When the fire effect is switched on, it gives an impressive imitation of a real one.Our small terraced house once had a real fire place, of course, but like so many it was modernised before I moved in, and it was filled in and central heating installed.Yet I am old enough to have lived all my childhood in the lsquos and lsquos without experiencing central heating! It did exist, of course, just not in the houses I lived in as a child!One memory I have is of arriving home from school on a cold winterrsquos afternoon and seeing the smoke coming from the chimney of the church house we lived in at the east end of the Pans. My father had lit the fire early and I still remember its welcoming warmth, and the way it crackled and danced as it defrosted my face and hands. Me and my brothers sat by it, jostling for the best space.Donrsquot get me wrong, Irsquom not complaining about central heating! I know Irsquom lucky to have a warm house and never take it for granted. We donrsquot use the lsquofirersquo for heat, that would be too expensive. But we switch it on for atmosphere. And the effect on the younger kids has been immediate. They sit by it, lie on blankets by it reading and playing and telling stories. I forget that they have little personal experience of having a hearth, even an articial one. The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes. As a storyteller, I have come to understand the importance of a hearth as a focal point for gathering it has the power to bring people together, to share warmth and light but also each otherrsquos presence and social connection. As the freezing wind rages outside, it is a magical space.That magic has been the true gt from my storyteller friend, and she wisely knew it. While much is missing from an articial fire, including the smell and sound of the real thing, our ancestral instinct still kicks in by the visual sight of a flickering hearth.So now my instructions to switch off the screens is more readily obeyed, because it signals time to get together around the fire and lsquobe together properlyrsquo to tell stories and challenge each other with riddles.Burnrsquos poem The Cotterrsquos Saturday Night now has new meaning in our house:To meet their dad, wi flichterin noise and glee.His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,His clean hearth-stane, his thrty wiersquos smile,The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,Does arsquo his weary kiaugh and care beguile,An makes him quite forget his labor and his toil."},{"url":null,"title":"waterside-bistro-chief-takes-castle-inn-dirleton","story":"Brothers Jack and James Findlay have been at the helm of the Waterside Bistro, next to the River Tyne in Haddington, for more than two-and-a-half years.The eaterie was founded by their dad Jim, who also previously ran The Drovers Inn in East Linton, and The Rocks on Dunbarrsquos Marine Road.Now, Jack is expanding the empire by taking over The Castle Inn.He told the Courier: ldquoWe have had quite a soft opening, we just opened yesterday [last Wednesday].ldquoI think the area is lovely and my dad was born in Dirleton, so there is a little bit of heritage there.ldquoWe will be basing it a lot on the Waterside model and obviously myself and my brother will be working alongside each other but from afar.ldquoWe have had tremendous success at the Waterside and we both felt it was probably the right time to look where.ldquoThe Castle Inn was the perfect fit for us.ldquoIt will be myself here and my brother is still based in Haddington.ldquoMy dad is lsquoretiredrsquo but will just be popping in and making sure we are going in the right direction.Twenty-eight-year-old Jack said they already had a good team in place and there were no plans for any ldquodrastic changes.A focus would be placed on locally sourced food, with a daily list of specials.He added: ldquoI would also like to mention the former owners John Dawson and Bert DrsquoAgostino, and want to pay a bit of a tribute to them for their fine work in the trade.ldquoJohn has been fantastic with me and very helpful."},{"url":null,"title":"bench-put-place-memory-tranent-legend-bobby-marr","story":"Bobby Marr, who ran a greengrocer and florist on Tranentrsquos Winton Place for nearly  years, passed away last July.The -year-old was a familiar face to many in Tranent town centre, with hundreds attending his funeral.Marion Hoggan was heavily involved in the fundraising for the bench for Mr Marr, who had colon cancer.She said: ldquoI did not manage the funeral due to work commitments and I felt that I wanted to do something for him.

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride. She was the bringer of light and plentul times, and so people loved her and looked forward to her arrival. Beria was jealous orsquo her.ldquoThis is why Beria kept Bride a prisoner. She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis. She wanted tae keep winter going sae her power would last longer. She whipped up a gale wi a wind sae cauld and sharp it felt like a bird pecking at yer skin. It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength.

It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig. He went to Sabhal Mograver to improve his language skills and says he would not hold his present job had he not become a fluent speaker.ldquoI was fully immersed in the language at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, which is essential to become fluent in any language. he says. ldquoYou could hear Gaelic being spoken every day, in every situation and that helped me no end in improving my own Gaelic. I gained a great deal of confidence in terms of Gaelic grammar, spelling and writing, all of which has been invaluable in my working le.BBC weather presenter, Joy Dunlop, is another graduate of the college who says the fluency in Gaelic she developed at the college has given her many opportunities that she otherwise would not have had.She studied Gaelic as a second language when she was a pupil at Oban High School then decided to do her sixth year at the college. She initially planned to stay for just one year to do the Cugraversa Comais but loved it so much she stayed for four, graduating with a BAin Cagravenan agus Cultar na Gagraveidhlig .ldquoAttending Sabhal Mograver was a revelation for me, she says. ldquoThe education I received was unparalleled.ldquoThe personal support and guidance I received from all the staff was of the highest level and I always felt that our teachers were genuinely invested in both the language itself and our progress.ldquoBeing immersed in the language is definitely the best way to learn, dficult as it could be at times, and having the opportunity to speak Gaelic in both the classes and the community was a real help to me.ldquoSimply,you genuinely want to learn Gaelic, there is no better place to do so than Sabhal Mograver Ostaig.

All that wee and poor Scotland would be able to afford would be wall-to-wall White Heather Club, interspersed with speeches from Alex Salmond.You can see where Irsquom going with this, canrsquot you :He acts the clown but Boris Johnson is a Bolshevik about powerThe former BBC Director-General, John Birt, said that Scots might not be able watch the BBC at all. Well, as it turns out perhaps no one will. At the weekend No Ten declared war on the BBC, saying that timersquos up for the licence fee.ldquoWersquore going to whack them, said a Government source, quoted in The Sunday Times. Probably been watching too many episodes of The Sopranos.The future is subscription. People wonrsquot pay a video poll tax in the age of Netflix, wersquore told. The BBC should sink or swim in the market ndash probably the former. First casualties will be local and ldquoregionalldquo servicesWersquore assured that this has nothing whatever to do with Andrew Neilrsquos lecture on the PMrsquos integrity when he refused to appear on his show during the General Election campaignNow, itrsquos not yet clear that the Government will get away with this. Many Tory MPs remain friends of the Beeb .Contrariwise, there are many independence supporters who hate the ldquoYoon BBC so much they are egging Mr Johnson on. There is a broad coalition of contempt for the BBC.This extends from most Labour Party members, who took to social media to condemn Laura Kuenssberg for being a Tory spokesperson, to the Daily , which believes the BBC is owned by Gina Miller and the Peoplersquos Vote campaign.It was ever thus. The BBC always gets both ideological barrels. But the point is that all this makes a nonsense of the claim that only by remaining in the UK could Scots still tune in to David Attenborough. Hersquos all over Netflix anyway.And the curious thing is that now there actually is a Scottish dedicated TV channel it is not filled with mawkish sentimentality and tartan kitsch. Most of the Scottishprogramming is rather good. Documentaries like Poverty Safari presented by the rapper Loki, for example ndash something the UK BBC would never have done.And therersquos quality. The drama Guilt was as good as anything on Netflix. Scotland has a unique character that is well suited to sardonic noir.The BBC is only the latest example of Scotland potentially losing great British institutions that were supposedly threatened onlywe voted Yes. Remember Royal Bank of Scotland saying that it would up sticks after independence Well, without a trace of irony, or self-awareness, RBS has just renamed itself the National Westminster Bank, in recognition of the fact that  per cent of its business is in the South.Another pillar of the Scottish financial sector, Standard Le, also threatened to leave Scotlandthere was a Yes vote in . It has now shted pound billion in assets to Dublin.Scots have a highly-developed sense of self-deprecating humour. Just as well. Because otherwise we might get very angryndash like those French demonstrators in Yellow Vests. Wersquore used to it. Like the weather.But yoursquod think that there would be just a hint of contrition from those nominally Scottish institutions which sought so recklessly to damage Scotlandrsquos reputation and national self-confidence five years agoRBS was already effectively a London bank in , with the majority of its operations in England. The threatened departure was contrived for political purposes.The same goes for Standard Le. Without a momentrsquos reflection, it has shted a number of operations to Ireland the better to remain in the European Union.I need hardly remind readers that Scots were told that only by voting No in , could Scotland be sure of remaining in the European Union. David Nish, the boss of Standard Le said almost exactly that. Many Scots believed him. When the history of Scottish independence is written, that will be up there with the poll tax and Margaret Thatcher.The list of broken referendum promises goes on and on. ldquoAs near a federal system as possible in the UK was how the former Labour PM, Gordon Brown, described the constitutional future should Scotland reject independence. That was the substance of The Vow published by the Daily Record, in cod vellum, and signed by all three UK party leaders.Well, the powers of Holyrood have been substantially curbed in the UK Withdrawal Act. The UK Government, when it can be bothered, insists that those powers over agriculture, fisheries, environment and so on will come winging back once Boris has Got Brexit Done.Anyone who believes that hasnrsquot been listening. Scotland will be allowed to administer these s, but standards will be set by the UK the better to facilitate trade deals with countries like America. Similarly, Michael Goversquos promise that Scotland would get powers over immigration after Brexit look ridiculous now.Itrsquos enough to make you want another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon keeps saying that Indyref will happen later this year. But that is a heroic case of hope triumphing over experience, or reality itself.The joke is on us. There wonrsquot be another legal referendum now that Mr Johnson is home with an -seat majority in Westminster.It feels ashistory itself is trolling Scotland, seeing just how much humiliation Scots are prepared to take.:Boris-induced surge evokes electric shock experimentEnglish people werenrsquot so docile and biddable. When Brexiters were confronted with Project Fear, they scoffed and voted regardless for what they regarded as independence from Brussels.Scots were given an offer they couldnrsquot refuse in : a borderless independence within Europe. Unfortunately, we did refuse it. And wersquore stuck with it.And herersquos the kicker.

I imagine the team of BBC Scotlandrsquos The Nine do the same when the new edition of Radio Times arrives.One reason for the news programmersquos pitully low, several men and a dog audience numbers, is the sheer strength of the peak time offerings on the main channels.Last night, for example, viewers could have chosen from a new series of MasterChef at pm, the police procedural documentary Murder  , or Flesh and Blood, ITVrsquos latest star-spangled whodunnit set over four nights.Written by Sarah Williams , Flesh and Blood began with a figure on a stretcher and a tease. The unidentied inidual was taken from a storm-lashed beach at night and loaded into an ambulance as a woman, in voiceover, set the scene.ldquoIrsquove known the family for years. I watched the children grow up, and I can honestly say theyrsquove been the perfect neighbours hellip Theyrsquove had their ups and downs. Who hasnrsquot  But I never, ever dreamt it would end like this.Who could resist such an opening, particularly when the narrator - reliable or unreliable  - is Imelda Staunton, playing Mary, the next door neighbour to the perfect family we suspect, and hope, are not so ideal after all.With its beside the Sussex seaside setting and intriguing opening, the ITV thriller has drawn comparisons with Big Little Lies, the Reece Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman-led Golden Globes winner. But Flesh and Blood is more grubby old Blighty in its concerns - nosy neighbour, arguments over money - than Calornia glossy, and it does not take itself too seriously.The plot is that old standby, recently widowed mum takes up with a new man, much to the suspicion of her adult children who worry about her - and their inheritance. It has been more than  months since Vivienlost her husband, and now she is introducing her boyfriend Markto children Jake, Helen and Natalie .Mark, being a retired surgeon, seems like quite the catch initially. Which woman wouldnrsquot want a man who, at a pinch, could perform an appendectomy on the kitchen table He is loving, romantic, attentive, whisking Vivien off to France for a surprise lunch in a private plane. But is he too good to be true Vivienrsquos children are not quite what they seem either, each having their share of secrets and enemies. Then there is singleton Mary next door, an eager little mouse who is always ready to take in a parcel or whip up a batch of cheese straws for Vivienshe is having the family around. Clearly suspicious.The cut where the camera moves from Mary telling the police that she likes to keep herself to herself, to her steaming open a parcel for next door, was wickedly good. Even better was the follow-up.Like Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window, Mary has a set of binoculars and they are not used for bird-watching. Between this, the sweeping orchestral score and the sunny setting in which dark events may or may not be taking place, there is an air of faux Hitchcock with slyly comic undertones about Flesh and Blood. After such a strong opener it has set a high bar for the next few nights.

Its track record on key domestic issues like education is woeful, and therersquos been such manoeuvring against Nicola Sturgeon that shersquos had to confirm she wants to stay on as leader.Yet a quick glance at election results and opinion polls is a reminder that little has dented the SNPrsquos political fortunes. The party went up  seats at the last general election in December  to  MPs on % of the vote. Polls show support for independence sitting at % in some cases.So when it comes to a profit and loss sheet, the party looks healthy. Behind the scenes, though, itrsquos a mess.How can this be  How can a party be doing so well and so bad at the same time  The answer lies in the fact that hardcore independence supporters will cut the SNP any amount of slack when it comes to scandals and mismanagement because itrsquos the only vehicle to get them what they want.That skews democracy, and it hasnt been good for the governance of Scotland.The SNP has been in power since  ndash in political terms thatrsquos an aeon. Over that time, the SNP has conformed to all the ills that beset political parties in office for y periods. Itrsquos got sloppy, fractious, and stupid. But unlike other political parties, itrsquos protected from the consequences by its super-weapon: the get out of jail free card its base of supporters lend it because of independence.Itrsquos like the Trump Effect. Donald Trump once said: \"They say I have the most loyal people. Did you ever see that  Where I could stand in the middle of Fth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldnrsquot lose any voters, okay  Itrsquos like incredible.Wersquove seen with Trump that he can do or say anything and his base doesnrsquot flinch. The same was true of Boris Johnson and Brexiteers. The same is true of the SNP and its base ndash because it wears independence like a shield.The problem is, though, therersquos no shield for Scotland or the Scottish people when it comes to bad government by the SNP.Education is a mess. Teachers are at the end of their tether, and results are atrocious. Pass rates for Higher English last year saw a drop of .% compared to  ndash thatrsquos  fewer pupils passing. Advanced Higher English pass rates dropped by .%.The pass rate for Higher History fell from .% to .%. Higher Modern Studies was down by .%. In Maths, the pass rate fell by .%.To make matters much worse, the Government was accused of trying to sneak these bad figures out by releasing them at night. It looked low and crafty.:MacAskill says tells SNP to focus on lsquogrunt workrsquo not marchingWhile education soaks up most of the negative headlines, therersquos also serious problems with policing and hospitals.There was a time ndash maybe five or six years ago, before the world went mad with identity disorder ndash when nearly all voters judged governments on how effective they were in office. Today, thatrsquos not the case for many voters.What matters to many is whether a political party reflects their sense of identity. This becomes a force field of protection, a magical cloak of invincibility. As long as a party reaffirms the identity of their base ndash be that via Brexit or independence ndash it will avoid the kind of supporter dissatisfaction which would end other governments.This creates a huge distortion in public debate ndash the essential cornerstone of democracy.Yet despite having this super-weapon in its possession, the power of identity as political protection, the SNP is now absurdly starting to juggle with live grenades.Itrsquos splitting rapidly on the best path towards independence. Some would like to see Sturgeon go. Independence, which until now has conferred protection, is beginning to damage the party from within.The isions in the party have crystallised in the Holyrood constituency of Edinburgh Central - Ruth Davidsonrsquos old stomping ground. Two big SNP names are jockeying for a place on the ballot - Joanna Cherry and Angus Robertson.The pair represent the two sides of the party split. Cherry is on whatrsquos been called the Salmond side, and Robertson is on the Sturgeon wing. In the crudest of terms, itrsquos the more populist branch versus the social democrat side of the party.:Analysis: Does Derek Mackay scandal mark the beginning of the end for the SNP Therersquos already mutterings of Cherry replacing Sturgeon as party leader. Of course, this isnrsquot the only split in the party. The SNP is also tearing itself apart over the increasingly toxic debate about trans rights.Letrsquos not forget that the SNP has also just gone through the Derek Mackay scandal, and itrsquos still got to weather the fall-out from the coming Alex Salmond trial.So internally, things look pretty awful for the SNP, but in terms of electoral performance and opinion polls the party is laughing hellip for now.Moving against Sturgeon would change the game for the party. Sturgeon has centre-ground appeal. Plenty of Unionist and No voters hate her, but to many people, shersquos seen as professional, decent, intelligent, and with her heart in the right place.Her rivals come across as isive, angry and slippery. The party wouldnrsquot lose its force field of identity, its shield,it lost Sturgeon ndash the base would still be there ndash but it would damage its centre-ground appeal.Of course, Sturgeon is to blame for a lot of this herself. Shersquos teased the base with independence for years in order to keep power. Now her more headstrong and ill-considered colleagues want to get on with it come what may.A grubby political assassination of Sturgeon would be the beginning of the end for the SNP, and that would inevitably mean the beginning of the end of the campaign for independence. The SNP must step very carefully, unless it wants to succumb to political gravity, dragging the dreams of its voters down with it.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":null,"title":"ian-murray-labour-must-win-back-scotland-chance-government","story":"Ian Murray, MP for Edinburgh South, made the remarks after being endorsed by two former Prime Minsters, Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, this morning.Mr Murray, who is competing against favourite Angela Rayner, as well as Dawn Butler, Richard Burgon and Rosena Allin-Khan, said a Scot should be put in a senior role within the party leadership to \"show all the nations and regions of the UK that they matter.\"He said: \"Irsquom proud to have the endorsement of both of Labourrsquos living Prime Ministers ndash Tony Blair and Gordon Brown ndash and the we of Labourrsquos greatest Prime Minister that never was.\"Without winning back Scotland, they could be the last Labour Prime Ministers.\"Mr Murray said the \"Corbyn experiment has not worked\" and said the party needed \"fundamental change\" in order to regain ground in the polls.He said: \"Were using these deputy leaderships as a staging ground to try to try and get the Labour party back into government.\"Thats where we need to be.

On my trip, for example, I arrived in Turin, but left from Milan, thus passing through two huge cities, two major railway stations, and two sizeable airports.The primary concern, naturally, is public health a pandemic ndash evenit has a mortality rate of ldquoonly around two per cent ndash still has the potential to kill millions. That was roughly the ratio for Spanish flu in , which killed  million people. But the economic impact has been as dramatic ndash even while the virus remains relatively contained.At the beginning of the week, the Dow Jones lost , points in a day . The Italian stock market dropped six per cent, shares in companies such as Apple, which rely on Chinese manufacturing, were down around four per cent, while travel firms got hammered: EasyJet lost a sixth of its total valuation on Monday alone.An outbreak of illness in a Chinese province most British people probably hadnrsquot heard of a few weeks ago has, more or less directly, led to a drop in sales of  per cent at stores in Bicester Village, an outlet centre in Oxfordshire.There are suggestions that there will be a shortage of toys this Christmas unless Chinese factories get back to normal in the next couple of weeks. Romania is attempting to quarantine anyone who has visited Lombardy, and my daughter tells me that Lidl in Turinhas run out of pasta after panic buying.The coronavirus is having a huge impact on Western economies as well as Chinarsquos, eventhe disease doesnrsquot sp widely. It is a largely unexpected and unavoidable natural event bound to occur now and then. But what it illustrates is that the prosperity and productivity of the Chinese worker has a direct effect on retail staff in Bicester or, for that matter, Brazilian soybean prices or Scotch whisky exports.And the major, altogether avoidable, contributors to creating such obstacles to increased prosperity, in China and at home, are barriers to trade. Thatrsquos why Brexit or UK US trade talks, dull stories compared with deadly pandemics, have comparable importance.The UK must have as much flexibility to deal with other countries as it has had with the EU which, far from being a free trade area, erects protectionist barriers . Tarf costs are borne, not by foreign countries, but by domestic importers and therefore consumers.Restrictions on the movement of goods and people necessitated by this outbreak are a sharp illustration of the economic costs of constraints on trade. And at least with trade policy we already know the prescription to avoid the damage."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-matrix-harvey-weinstein-verdict-hope-change","story":"Editorial and comment pieces reflected on how the verdict is the start of a change for the better.The IndependentCleacutemence Michallon in her column says ldquoagainst all sexist odds, Harvey Weinstein has been found guilty of rape and sexual assault. This is history.She said: ldquoThe Weinstein trial was the second-biggest court case of the #MeToo movement, after Bill Cosbyrsquos  sexual assault conviction. The fact that it ended with a conviction, when the US justice system has such an indelible record of systemic misogyny, is a statistical anomaly the importance of which cannot be overstated.ldquoThat this trial happened at all is a sign that people feel increasingly able to speak out and challenge powerful abusers. We as a society are beginning to change, too ndash I want to believe that wersquore doing a better job at listening to people who say theyrsquove been abused and at knowing how to support them. Conversations about harassment and assault are more frequent now than they were five years ago.She went on to say: ldquoObviously, we still have a long way to go. But the fact that the justice system is beginning to march to the tune of the victimsrsquo drum is the result of a type of profound change that is only achieved through collective action and time.ldquoHarvey Weinstein has been found guilty of sexual assault and third-degree rape. This is history.The ScotsmanIn its editorial the paper says Weinsteinrsquos conviction for rape and sexual assault is a landmark event for the #MeToo movement.The paper said: ldquoThe good thing to come out of all this is that society has fundamentally changed. Anyone in a position of power now knows - or should know - that they cannot abuse it the risks of being caught are too high.ldquoGone are the days when this kind of behaviour was an open secret to be joked about in the style of Donald Trump and his infamous ldquolocker room talk about getting away with sexually assaulting women because he was famous. Trump knows he may face legal action when he eventually leaves the White House.ldquoOnce inidual victims may have thought they were alone and that no one would believe them, but the extraordinary litany of offences exposed by the #MeToo movement means the scales of justice are no longer weighted against them and they will now get a fair hearing.The Daily Celia Walden wrote in her column that the verdict is proof that itrsquos still worth coming forward.She said: ldquoAs one of the most powerful men in Hollywood has been taken down, many of those who said ldquome too are being validated. On Twitter, stars yesterday [Monday] sent ldquolove and support to all the women who came forward - although others pointed out that those who kept his open secret for years will never face justice.ldquoHarvey Weinstein is now a convicted rapist, wrote TV chef Padma Lakshmi, while filmmaker Judd Apatow reminded everyone that since Weinstein face four more charges in Los Angeles: ldquoThis is just the beginning.The TimesIn her comment piece Janice Turner says Weinsteinrsquos conviction halts age of sexual impunity. She said the verdict ldquofeels less like a victory than a blessed relief.She said: ldquoAs Weinstein treated Hollywoodrsquos young women like a running sexual buffet, it probably never crossed his mind that hersquod end up in prison for rape. Why would anyone believe a flighty young actress, whorsquod perhaps stripped for a sex scene, over a genius producer  These women knew it too: they shut up, had therapy, and tried to forget. His victims do not only include those he sexually assaulted, but actresses like Mira Sorvino and Ashley Judd, whose promising careers Weinstein spitefully derailed because they fled his grasp.ldquoAbove all, Weinsteinrsquos conviction is a triumph for female solidarity. Women whose sexual assaults happened too long ago for charges to be brought nonetheless spoke out to prove a patter of abusive behaviour.ldquoOlder and younger victims united to bring him to justice.ldquoWith Weinsteinrsquos conviction, the age of sexual impunity is dead."},{"url":null,"title":"jonathon-shafi-snp-must-put-independence-first-forget-eu-obsession","story":"Yet at the present moment, the SNP leader is fending off questions about her future. And no matter the spin that is applied to the First Ministers lsquorebuttalrsquo to Boris Johnsons inevitable rejection of a Section , the UK Government has the upper hand. The perceived wisdom that lsquothe greater the Tories obstruction, the greater the momentum towards independencersquo is a comforting soundbite for many. But it fails to take account of the fact that momentum and morale can also be disrupted and stymied. That is what is happening now.Todays problems are rooted in the way the SNP has related to Brexit for the past three years. Among a litany of failed initiatives, designed to satiate the independence grassroots, there has been a dearth of vision around the case for independence itself. Instead, it became obsessed with lsquostopping Brexitrsquo.This has led to the slow erosion between the SNP leadership and a large part of the wider movement. Nicola would appear at the Stop Brexit demonstration, alongside a whorsquos who of the British establishment, while independence demonstrations would get a tweet. Independence and the EU have become synonymous, to the extent that the whole project has become subsumed into ascending into the trade block.Electoral success cant mask the deeper strategic problems this has brought about. Many rods have been placed up the back of the independence movement. Does it now, for example, have a leg to stand on when there are calls for a confirmatory vote after a Yes vote  Even some independence supporting commentators claim that a Yes vote must hit sixty percentit is to be viable because of the lsquoBrexit shamblesrsquo. Others say independence will be nothing as chaotic as the Brexit. But this fails to acknowledge the institutional power of the British state, the City and so on, that will be wielded to impede and block the realisation of an independent Scottish state.And there is another problem being studiously ignored by SNP strategists. If independence has become what feels like a single issue campaign for EU membership, there should be a rock solid plan for entering the EU upon independence. Yet, remarkably, the Growth Commission, talked up as the negotiating position following a Yes vote, would inhibit EU membership because the proposal for Sterlingisation with the UK would leave Scotland without monetary policy autonomy, as the Growth Commission report admits.In  a former EU economic affairs commissioner said: \"As to the question of whether sterlingisation were compatible with EU membership, the answer is that this simply would not be possible, since that would obviously imply a situation where the candidate country concerned would not have a monetary authority of its one, and thus no necessary instruments for EMU.\"In the context of Brexit, the present proposal on currency is an even larger hindrance to becoming an EU member. The last three years should have, among a host of other things, normalised in the public mind an independent currency. Raise this matter, and you are met with a telling silence.The lsquoleave a light onrsquo sensibility evokes the EU as a moral force. But this forgets that it is above all  a trade bloc. One that has ruthlessly attacked wages, pensions and public spending. Between  and , the European Commission, made demands on suppressing wage growth  times, and on collective bargaining rights  times. The idea that the EU is a benevolent administrator of workers right is a myth. These rights have been won by the trade unions, who at the present moment are in a stand off with French President Macron, the shining new hope of the EU.The EU is not only undemocratic, in that its own structures are insulated from popular pressure and accountability, but also anti-democratic in that it erodes democratic structures of accountability where, particularly in member states. This doesnrsquot just include flashpoints like Catalonia, but its daily ing. It is likely to get less democratic ndash and more militarised ndash as the crisis of Western politics and the global economy intensies.The new commission to lsquodefend the European way of lersquo set up to deal with immigration matters, directly mirrors the rhetoric of the far right. Since the early s, , people have died attempting to enter fortress Europe. So we must dispense the notion that the EU will stand up for migrants. In  Nicola Sturgeon said, lsquoThere are , EU nationals from other states living in Scotlandhellip Scotland was outside Europe, they would lose the right to stay here. Post Brexit, this now needs to be turned on its head, with a new social contract for migrants guaranteeing their rights in Scotland regardless of EU membership.Brexit has been used as a means to win independence. But it is a blunt instrument. Yes, we have seen a rise in support since Brexit. But these polling spikes appeared straight after the referendum result, and after Brexit day. The much vaunted middle class No voters around which the whole strategy appears to have been built is a highly unstable cohort, opposed to disruption. Remember, too, that around a third of Yes voters have changed position since Brexit. Yes leavers are signicant, but ignored in the current approach.The logistical problems outlined here force us to revisit the basis of how we relate to the EU. This is a reality with which the national political debate in Scotland has not yet caught up. But it is also an opportunity to recast independence as a vision that can transform the fortunes of the working class majority in Scotland, and that can centre the need for new democratic institutions that can meet the challenges of the st century. Scotland has a chance to lead the way, but onlythe independence cause is promoted as something far larger than ascension to the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"have your say on future of library services","story":"A series of open public engagement events will be held in libraries throughout Aberdeenshire next week.The informal drop-in sessions will give people the chance to find out more about Live Le Aberdeenshire’s plans for developing libraries, and the opportunity to share their opinions and ideas about future services.An online survey seeking views on future library provision runs until the end of the month and has already attracted more than , responses.The open sessions in communities are intended to complement this survey, seeking the opinions of those who use – or don’t yet use – their local library.Knowledgeable staff will be on hand in each venue to talk through planned changes and improvements, with a wealth of information about the ways in which libraries fit into community le at the moment.Modern libraries aim to be at the heart of their community - a safe and neutral space to browse, learn and meet people.Take this opportunity to shape your local library service over a cup of tea and a chat.Public engagement events:Ellon Library: Tuesday, February  - am to pm.Inverurie Library: Thursday, February  - am to pm.Kemnay Community Cafe, Kemnay Hall: Friday, February  - .am to .am.Kintore Library: Monday, February  - .pm to pm.Meldrum Library: Tuesday, February  - pm to pm.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

OIC has also said all profit would stay in the islands and be used to aid in preserving and enhancing key services as well as providing a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.OIC claims the wind farm projects would also allow the council to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney.Planning applications for the Hoy and Faray projects are likely to follow in Summer and Autumn respectively, due to additional survey requirements for these sites. Public consultation events will be held shortly in these areas to present the latest plans and gather public views.All three developments are substantial, and the turbines are of a height not used in Orkney before, being .m tall at blade tip. The council says it recognises that the projects present a number of potential impacts and these must be weighed against the project#s potential benefits. Iniduals will have dferent opinions on that balance and through the planning process have the opportunity to express their support or objections to the development.Councillors agreed late last year that a request should be made to the Scottish Government to call-in the application on the grounds that the development is of national signicance. That request has now been made and the council is awaiting a decision as to whether they will call in the application or not.The full application documents are available through the council website, with more information available at the application search and submission page, here.

More, of course, needs to be done, not leastwe are to meet the challenge of the climate emergency, but I have no doubt that farmers in Orkney and across the country are up for meeting that challenge.“In order to be able to do that, however, they will need access to a broad range of measures, reflecting the dferent circumstances and approaches to agriculture across the country. This will allow each to make a meaningful contribution to reducing emissions, improving sustainability while safeguarding a sector that plays a crucial role within our economy.“It is also important that any future trade agreements negotiated hold food imports to the same high standards we require of our domestic food producers. It makes no sense to demand standards of our own farming sector that we are prepared to ignore when it comes to those importing food into the UK. This is not an unreasonable demand from the NFUS and I am pleased it is one that enjoys cross-party support, including from Scottish Ministers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While provision has been made, it has consistently fallen short of what is required to reflect fair ferry funding.“Ministers may have changed, but the commitment was one made on behalf of the government. Indeed, the First Minister spent much of last summer in Shetland repeatedly the promises of fair funding.“Claiming it is the responsibility of everyone  to deliver the promises they have made lacks credibility. Instead of holding communities in Orkney and Shetland to ransom each year, the government should honour its commitment to fully deliver on fair ferry funding for these lelines services.”Ms Wishart added: “This Government has already accepted that it must provide full and fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles. Continuing to deny Shetland and Orkney the funding needed to run these leline services is completely unacceptable. At worst it is total cynicism.“The Government needs to step up and deliver on the clear evidence that it has been presented with year after year. We will not allow previous commitments to be traded away.“It is no exaggeration to say that the future of some island communities relies on sustainable ferry services. However, the money that has been given to Shetland Islands Council in recent years does not meet the true cost of running our ferries.“When the budget was announced it was described as having “wellbeing and fairness at its very heart”. But this settlement does not reflect that and is not reflective of a Government that is alive to the needs of island communities.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It acknowledged that Orkney’s internal ferry services fell short of minimum standards in terms of cost, reliability, frequency and accessibility. Since then, little progress has been made.“What has happened, however, is that the ferries operating these leline routes have got older, less reliable and more costly to run. Despite the best efforts of crews, we have seen increasing levels of disruption, including the ongoing problems with the MV Eynhallow. This situation is simply not sustainable and needs to be addressed.“Scottish Government needs to agree a clear timetable for taking forward the procurement of replacement vessels so that communities in Orkney have the leline services they deserve. I will be following this up with the Minister.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The event brought together figures from the worlds of politics, business, media and the arts to look at how the argument might be won for the future of the United Kingdom, and Scotland’s place in it.It was a timely event. Recent opinion polls show that support for Scottish independence, as against remaining in the United Kingdom, is finely balanced. Whilst the impact of Brexit arguably makes the economic case for independence weaker than it was in , the cultural impact may have been in the opposite direction.In any event, it is clear that the arguments deployed by the Better Together campaign in  are no longer as valid today as they were then. Unionism has been in search of a new narrative.At the weekend conference, the former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown spoke about the values of “empathy, solidarity, cooperation and sharing”, which relate to the nations of the United Kingdom. Whilst language of this nature makes a great deal of sense, it is my view that a practical approach is required in terms of making the case for the Union. In that respect, I believe that there are three key areas which need to be addressed.: Here’s why I’m backing Nicola Sturgeon to win independence for Scotland – Angus Robertson: This SNP government is guilty of dereliction of duty - Brian MonteithFirstly, the UK Government has to stop sitting on the sidelines, and become more activist in its support for the Union. The old days of “devolve and forget” have to be left behind.There is a very substantial spend by the UK Government in reserved areas across Scotland, not least in pensions and defence. Faslane’s importance to the economyTo give just one illustration, the naval base at Faslane on the Clyde will now be the home to not just the nuclear-armed submarine fleet, but also conventionally armed underwater vessels.This massive investment by the Ministry of Defence within Scotland makes Faslane the second-largest single-site employer in the country, after only the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow.And yet, how often do we see this huge economic footprint, and the thousands of jobs supported both directly and indirectly, made reference to in debates on the Scottish economy  We cannot expect SNP ministers to talk about it, but it should be shouted from the rooftops by their UK counterparts.In addition, the new UK Shared Prosperity Fund gives a real opportunity for Whitehall ministers to spend directly in Scotland on necessary infrastructure and other projects – demonstrating that where the SNP in Government are failing to deliver, the UK can step in and assist directly.The second area that needs to be addressed is the weakness that exists in the UK constitution, particularly as we move into a post-Brexit era. This should not be confused with the ongoing clamour from the SNP for yet more devolution to Holyrood.It is now entirely clear that the policy of devolving more powers to Scotland in response to a growth in nationalist support, in an effort to protect the Union, is one which is bankrupt.Shared wartime experiences now a distant historyThe Scottish Parliament now has fiscal powers which are the envy of many sub-national institutions in federal states. Far from making full use of these powers, we have actually seen the SNP Government hand these back – it is not willing to take on the operation of air passenger duty, despite legislation being passed to devolve it in , it has delayed the assignment of VAT, and it will not assume some new social security powers for as many as six years.Where the constitution does need attention is in relation to structures at Westminster which still need reform. There is a broad political consensus that the replacement of the House of Lords with something akin to a new Senate, representing the disparate parts of the United Kingdom, is now overdue.In addition, there requires to be a serious restructuring of inter-governmental machinery within the UK, possibly with the creation of a new Council of Ministers to provide a forum for ongoing discussion on shared policy areas, and to resolve disputes.Thirdly, a new cultural argument for the Union has to be developed. It is no longer enough to hark back to past glories. As my party leader, Jackson Carlaw, pointed out recently, to today’s youth the Second World War, and the nations of the UK standing in solidarity together against the Nazi threat, is simply distant history.I was born  years after the end of the Second World War, and my parents lived through that period. For my children, born in a dferent century entirely, it has quite a dferent impact from when someone of my age grew up with Victor comics and Commando books being a constant cultural reminder of this period in our history.A multi-cultural liberal democracyWe need to talk positively of the UK as a project – a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, liberal democracy, one which, despite our many failings, is nevertheless a remarkable success story in modern European terms. The UK is, after all, one of the few European countries not to have witnessed the rise of the far-right. London, one of the world’s great cities, is not the “Dark Star” of nationalist imaginings, but a melting pot of creed and colour, providing enormous opportunities to young Scots of this generation, just as it has done for so many generations past.As a country, our cultural output in the fields of music, film and drama, leads the world. All this lies on our doorstep, with no restrictions whatsoever on Scots living, working, and doing business, across our four nations.Writing at the weekend, the commentator Alex Massie observed that “Scotland has more in common with the rest of the United Kingdom, even after Brexit, than it does with anywhere  on earth”. That is undoubtedly true, however uncomfortable it might be to nationalists. What unionists need to do is make the argument that the UK is a positive project that we want to be a part of, and not a distant land full of dferent people, against whom we need to place barriers.What is encouraging about the output from the These Islands conference is that it is clear there is a new urgency and energy within Scottish unionism.

The gardens are being offered globally to businesses as a place “to showcase your brand and increase experiential marketing activity”.The language converts the gardens into a commodity. As citizens we should be able to stroll through our gardens without being immersed in a brand or subjected to marketing: we need places to escape from being bombarded with exhortations to consume more and more. We are seeing the normalisation of a set of relationships where a local authority morphs into a business. The results are all too visible in East Princes Street Gardens where the mud and water is the legacy of the council’s partnership with Underbelly for the Christmas Market, which began construction four months ago.: ‘Reimagined’ Princes Street Gardens would host  major events a year under new business plan: ‘Naming rights’ for new-look Princes Street Gardens set to go up for grabsThe trashing of East Princes Street Gardens makes it even more important to get improvements to West Princes Street Gardens right. The initiative of hotelier Norman Springford five years ago to donate money to restore the Ross Fountain was widely welcomed, and the results appreciated. However, his ambition for a wholesale makeover of the gardens no longer looks the way to go and his resignation from leading the controversial Quaich Project may mark a new chapter in what’s been a long-running story.An international design competition was held in , and the artists’ impressions of the winning designs have been widely published. However, until there is a planning application we do not know just what might be proposed. Until we know that, and until engineering surveys have been done, the final cost of the scheme is pretty much guesswork .‘City-wide entertainment and exhibition offer’A figure of £ million has been advanced by the project team, with the city council offering to find £ millionthe other £ million can be raised. A public consultation run by the Quaich Project in late  found that nature – bioersity, environmental responsibility, mental health and well-being – was ranked top of four priorities for the gardens, with celebration – arts and public performance – the lowest ranked.The council and the promoters of the scheme have boxed themselves in. By aspiring to make the gardens “the focal point for a unied city-wide entertainment and exhibition offer” they are courting unnecessary controversy but a less expensive, more modest approach could command widespread support. For example, make “nature” the unambiguous top priority it would be the best fit for the climate emergency, and is what people most value about this gem in the World Heritage Site.Reimagine the play area and the shelters, and find ways to improve disabled access, particularly at the west and east entrances where most people enter or leave. Make the existing bandstand and seating fit for the kind of small community-based events which featured prominently in the public consultation.Sometimes city should say ‘no’It is the expensive and intrusive “big ticket” items in the current proposals – the Welcome Centre corporate entertainment building, the new stage, and bridge over the railway to enable larger articulated vehicles to access the gardens – that propel the marketing of naming rights, exclusive corporate events etc.The £ million the council has committed to providing could go a long way to delivering the smaller upgrades. If more is needed, look to borrowing, real philanthropy or crowdfunding, but not corporate branding. There would be no more fortnight of Summer Sessions during August or big Hogmanay concerts in the gardens. Dropping these would be an immediate step to delivering the aim in the new Edinburgh Tourism Strategy to manage tourism and make Edinburgh “an exemplar in achieving environmentally sustainable urban tourism”.If the city and the industry are serious about this, they have to say “no” to some things. Events designed to attract more tourists at precisely the times when the city is already most crowded should top that list.There have been complaints that noise from the Summer Sessions disrupts enjoyment at the Tattoo, and we know that the screens erected to block views from Princes Street into the open-air concerts restrict pavement width at the busiest time of the year. The council argues that these major events have to be held so that small “community” events in the gardens can be cross-subsidised. This obfuscates some basic points. Any charge for state school use is simply a transfer within the city council – from education to cultural venues. The council has enough money to pay huge sums to Underbelly, for example, to run Hogmanay: can’t it subsidise local performers  Finally, towns across Europe stage community-based events without handing over their cities to big commercial operators: it’s something councils are there for.Instead of selling the names of walkways or entrance gates to Huawei or Amazon or whoever will “donate” most money, let’s give residents the opportunity to suggest and vote for names.The memorial benches – so casually dumped and discarded in East Princes Street Gardens – and the memorials to those sacriced in wars provide the basis for a dferent kind of branding, one recognising the erse contributions made by people who were inspired by and loved this exceptional city, and who made the lives of others better. Why not a Robert Louis Stevenson Walk  Or a commemoration of the passionate energy that Ricky Demarco invested in the arts in Edinburgh  Let’s have a flower bed or a series of school choir performances named after Helen Crummy who pioneered the idea of arts–led regeneration in Craigmillar.Let our premier park tell their authentic stories and those of others like them, rather than advertise a mobile phone company or banking group.Clf Hague is chair of the Cockburn Association©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"family of caroline flack share unpublished instagram she wanted to post","story":"The family of Caroline Flack have released an unpublished Instagram post that the star wrote in the days before her death, in which she said that within  hours her whole world and future had been swept from under her feet.The -year-old former Love Island host, who took her own le, described the domestic incident with boyfriend Lewis Burton as \"an accident\".\"On December the th  I was arrested for common assault on my boyfriend,\" she wrote. \"Within  hours my whole world and future was swept from under my feet and all the walls that I had taken so long to build around me, collapsed.\"I am suddenly on a dferent kind of stage and everyone is watching it happen.\"I have always taken responsibility for what happened that night.\"Even on the night.\"But the truth is ...

So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top.

Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

Until we accept there is a problem, there is never going to be a solution.”Oldpark SDLP councillor and the party’s homelessness spokesperson, Paul McCusker, described the figures as “worrying”.“According to figures from the Housing Executive, there is a chronic need for more social housing in North Belfast,” he added.“While housing should absolutely be allocated based on objective need, it is clear that stark disparities exist in predominantly nationalist areas, like the ones I represent in Ardoyne and Carrick Hill.“The area known as North Belfast One showed an average need of , houses in  , a steady increase since   when  homes were required. Just % of the  housing allocations in North Belfast in   were in NB while % were in NB, despite the dfering levels of requirement for social housing between both areas.“These figures are worrying but unfortunately are not surprising to many of us in North Belfast, who have been aware for some time of the dficulties. Behind these figures are families who have been waiting, many for years and in inadequate conditions, to get a house and build a home. They should not have to wait any longer.“I welcome the frank statement from Minister Hargey, who shares my concern at the inequalities highlighted. I hope she will make it a priority to redress this stark imbalance.”A spokesperson for the Housing Executive said:“We will be reviewing current record-keeping practice in light of the Minister’s comments and officials will engage with the DfC about this issue.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-21-at-16.02.40.png","title":"healthy food has never been this tasty","story":"YOU could be forgiven for wondering why a new café has opened so close to one of the busiest gyms in West Belfast. After all, who wants a feed after healthy work-out However, Kaff is a café with a dference. Located beneath GymCo in the grounds of the thriving Devenish Complex, Kaff offers a food and drink menu that is very much caterd for those gym-bunnies who hop by it daily.From a range of breakfast items to an all-day brunch, there is something for everyone on the menu – and for those who want a ‘cheat day’, fear not, Kaff offers a selection of freshly-made traybakes too, including caramel squares, raspberry ruffles and chocolate brownies.It was a Thursday lunchtime when myself and two colleagues paid a visit to Kaff, which opened a fortnight ago. We were shown to our table by a friendly and helpful member of staff.We were assured the coffee is very popular, so it would have been rude not to order my favourite, the simple, timeless, classic Cappuccino. An Americano and what I would call proper tea – the one in a pot with tealeaves – completed our drinks order.On to the food and the menu was a challenge – in a really, really good way. You can be as creative as you want using the ever-popular sourdough bread, eggs cooked the way you like them, not to mention salads, sandwiches, smashed avocado and beans.As it was lunchtime, we were drawn to the mouth-watering choices on the main food menu. I was immediately attracted to the ham hock, served with crushed potato, spring onion, spinach, a fried egg and siracha sauce. As someone who’s not exactly a gym regular, the dish was what I would describe as on the middle-range of healthiness.The pulled ham hock was melt-in-your-mouth stuff and full of flavour, perfectly-accompanied by some expertly-cooked potatoes, spinach, spring onion and perfectly fried egg, all bound together with that hot kick of siracha sauce. Every bite was mouth-watering and I would not hesitate in rushing back to Kaff to order again- it was that good. Priced at just £, it was great value for the generous portion.Across the table, a colleague was feeling creative and opted for toasted sourdough, complete with smashed avocado, smoked jalapeno salsa, poacher and black sesame. The dish had an abundance of flavour and he described it as “refreshing” given that nice kick thanks to the jalapeno. You can do a lot with sourdough bread, as you will see in many cafes across Belfast, but Kaff’s offering was unique and clearly a lot of thought was put into it.Our final lunch-goer couldn’t resist trying Kaff’s all-day breakfast – or to put it more factually, “a healthy fry”. It is was not a surprise to learn this is already proving to be a real hit with customers already – and it’s not hard to see why. It was made up of black pudding, beef sausage, grilled bacon, cherry tomatoes and some of the best poached eggs I have ever seen, all served with the aforementioned sourdough bread and smashed avocado.My colleague was particular impressed by the smashed avocado and plans a rapidjust so his better half can give it ago. I have to admit I was kind of jealous when it was brought to the table. For just £, you’d go a long way to find that quality at that value.With our stomachs satisfied, we resisted the temptation to go for an after-lunch traybake, but I was instructed via phone by a colleague back at the office towith a chocolate protein ball, which I was duly informed is essential for that tasty little bit of extra energy to get over the line in the weekly parkrun.Kaff is serving food and drink with a dference. If, like me, you have tended to pull a face whenever you’re hungry and healthy food is mentioned, then,l again like me, you’re in for a very pleasant surprise.Kaff Belfast,- Finaghy Road North,Belfast,Tel:   www.kaffbelfast"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sketch-1581936686704.png","title":"meet the inspirational lori","story":"“THE greatest pleasure in le is doing what people say you cannot do.”That is how Lori Gatsi-Barnett begins her typical day.

Her le is enriched with business skills, which has helped Lori to train clients in ersity work, small and medium enterprise and corporate social responsibility. She cannot afford to be idle becauseshe doesn’t do it, someone will, that’s the reality.Last year, Lori launched a community interest company called JoinHer Network. It is an open-for-all, impartial, internationally erse group of women whose main scope of work is to change women’s lives for the better. For all women, she says, “Things may be challenging but le is what one makes it. There are many surprises out there, you will not know until you take the chance. There are no limits to what we women can do.”Belfast needs many Loris. We do.The JoinHer Network has seven solid members from dferent jobs and erse experience in the arts, community action, health and business. The group is mobilising new members from across the community to get involved in pushing for making their stories and experiences something that would inspire young women not to give up in whatever successes they have ambitions for.Besides the JoinHer network and continuing to spice up Ireland with good food for thought, Lori is absolutely the essence and mother of good TV. Headhunters should be looking right here.Finally, another factual week. The first-time ethnicity was used as a tick box in the Northern Ireland Census was in .

In between dodging the last remnants of Storm Ciara, the former St Genevieve’s High School pupil and Derry Girls actress is warm, funny and straight talking about how her version of Willy Russell’s creation is “very much of this particular period in time”.She said: “Audiences have come with their friends, then they’ve come again and brought their mums, mother-in-laws, it’s phenomenal. Audiences feel like Shirley and it’s a gt that they want to give to other people. With the character of Shirley, I suppose it’s that thing that people always talk about, about being a ‘strong female lead’. Well, what is a strong female lead  To me, a strong female lead is someone who is flawed, they show their flaws. Shirley is just every woman and that is what is beautul about her. The character of Shirley has so many dilemmas that every woman faces, no matter what we are.“In the play Shirley talks about being back in school, she believed that good things were not meant for her.“A lot of us come out of school feeling like that or afraid to try stuff because we are afraid to fail.“I’ve been asked to contribute to a piece ITV are doing for International Women’s Day in March – what would you say to your younger self  The only thing I would say to my younger self is to try stuff, fail,you fail what is the worst that can happen  You get back up and you do it again, you do it better. This industry is constantly trying, but you can also play it safe. Shirley has been afraid to make mistakes her whole le. She’s got the . children, the nice house, it’s spotless, the husband, Joe, he’s out working, there isn’t much more she can do. It’s basically a question then of, ‘Is this it ’“Yes, Shirley is  and when I say that on stage people laugh because today, in , it’s so young. But actually  years ago  seemed older, people acted and carried themselves older. I’m  and I go, ‘Well, I’m young.’ We’ve come a long way, I think.”During the production’s initial run, Tara Lynne spoke of how, post-show, she had some “brilliant, absolutely incredible conversations” with women and men of all ages.“I had women in their s want to talk about the play, sixth form students talk to me about how they related to it.”Tara Lynne said that the revival of the play is also a fitting tribute to her friend and assistant director, Julie Maxwell, who tragically passed away last August during a night out in the city centre.“I know we all will truly miss her, I truly miss Julie, I have all the notes that she gave me during our first run of rehearsals. I feel that the success of the show and its second staging is a good way to honour her.”When the curtain comes down on this run, Tara Lynne will be preparing to start filming for the juggernaut that is Channel Four’s smash hit Derry Girls. Playing Ma Mary, the matriarch of the Quinn McCool clan, Tara Lynne has gained something of a cult following with her s perm, jumpers and ‘punt purse’ throughout the show’s two series.“We will hopefully be getting the script soon and I’ve no idea what is in them yet. We will be filming May through to July and I can’t wait to see everybody and the third series will be out later in the year. I’ve also written a play for the Belfast Festival later in the year so it’s very much a case of watch this space.”•Shirley Valentine willto the Lyric Theatre from February  until March .

The combination of a growing younger population, gently rising property prices, and some of the lowest housing costs in Ireland or Britain means that Belfast is a hub of activity for younger people in the property market.In order to gain a greater insight into the experience of these first-time buyers in the local property market, the ATN spoke to two young couples that recently bought their first homes in Belfast as well as real estate expert Colin Moran of Property People. Our goal was to investigate what motivates young people out of the rental market towards purchasing, as well as the factors involved in choosing their first property.Fionntan Smithof Ladybrook, and his fiancée Ciararecently purchased their first home, a semi-detached four-bedroom house with a back garden, in Gransha, in the heart of Andersonstown. They said their purchase was a reflection of their two main priorities: an advantageous location and the space to start a family.“Before we purchased we were both living at home with our parents and saving money: we weren’t keen on getting into the rental market and always having that insecurity over your head,” Fionntan said.“Once we knew we wanted to start a family together we looked at a number of locations and homes. I suppose we could have looked at something cheaper down the road, or a more modern home further out in the ‘commuter ring’, but we decided that our priority was the advantages of living in such an older, settled, well-established area like Gransha.“There’s barely any crime here and being in the middle of West Belfast gives you’re the proximity to the city centre, pubs, public transport, the shops. At the same time, we have plenty of rooms and we have a big back garden, which allows us to raise a family.”Chris Campbell-Palmerand his partner Yvonneon the other hand, decided to purchase their first property – a three-bedroom terraced house – just off the Ravenhill Road in Southeast Belfast after eight years of co-habiting in rented accommodation.“We took the step of getting our first home because ultimately we were sick of moving so often, sometimes due to poorly-maintained properties and disputes with landlords,” they told the ATN.“Financially at the end of the day it is more expensive to rent and that isn’t sustainable. We looked at flats first but there’s a real lack of affordable apartments in Belfast, so that’s when we expanded outwards to look at houses in South and East Belfast, where prices are affordable for first-time buyers.“Even though it’s an older property which needs a bit of work, the house we settled on has more space than a typical terraced house, so we can have friends visit or maintain a lodger. Eventhe area is new to us it’s only a mile walk to the Ormeau Road where most of our friends are as well as being close to the city centre for work.”Director of Property People, Colin Moran, concurred with both couples’ choice to move out of the rental market and into owning their homes.“Purchase every time would be my advice. Despite the flexibility of renting, is in my opinion not a good long-term housing option,” he said.“Owning your property gives you much more stability over the future of your home and an asset that can be sold or passed on to future generations. As far as location and the features of the home you settle on, buying a property is very exciting and provides the buyer the ability to choose their home to reflect their personality, le choices, and future. For dferent people that will mean dferent things but the priority is to make sure your home fits your le as it is much more than just the building itself but how it can enhance your le.“In terms of professional advice, I would urge people to get on the property ladder at an affordable entry point, and aim for a % deposit as you have plenty of time to pay it off,” he added.“In terms of an investment, a good investment property is in a location that will be desirable for tenants to ensure occupancy, be of a good standard or at price that reflects any refurbishments. The numbers have to work in terms of rental yield as well, and that is key to bear in mind and somewhere were buyers should seek advice from an expert.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland community pharmacists vote for industrial action","story":"Growing crisis: Gerard Greene FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappGrowing crisis: Gerard GreeneBy Lisa SmythFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Health Minister is facing a fresh crisis after community pharmacists voted to begin industrial action.High street pharmacists, who dispense one million NHS prescriptions every week in Northern Ireland, have said they are being forced to take the action to ensure the safety of patients.It comes after talks between Community Pharmacy Northern Ireland and the Department of Health failed to reach an agreement.Pharmacists in Northern Ireland have repeatedly said severe underfunding of the key NHS service means they are increasingly unable to pay wholesaler bills for medication.This has resulted in patients experiencing dficulties in getting their medication.Pharmacists recovering from surgery have also reported leaving hospital against medical advice because they cannot afford to pay for cover at their premises.No date has yet been set for the beginning of the unprecedented industrial action, although services have already been disrupted as a result of the ongoing funding row, as pharmacists reduce services and opening hours in a bid to make ends meet.Gerard Greene, chief executive of Community Pharmacy NI, said: We have been warning the Department for years of this growing crisis.A litany of unresolved issues stemming from sustained underfunding now means that community pharmacists have reached breaking point. The decision to take action is not one reached lightly and we regret that the refusal of the Department to address this crisis has brought us to this, but our network is at the point where the safe delivery of crucial frontline services for patients could be compromised.Over , people visit pharmacies in Northern Ireland every single day.The ability to access this service and professional advice keeps people out of GP surgeries and hospitals.Community pharmacists already play an enhanced role in transforming our health service but until the Department engages in meaningful talks to stabilise community pharmacy funding and address the current issues, then it is only paying lip service.Any industrial action by the community pharmacy sector will be a hammer blow to official efforts to sht more work out of hospitals and into the community.Under efforts to reform the health service and drive down spiralling hospital waiting lists, more work is being done in the primary care sector.Community Pharmacy NI has been campaigning for increased funding for the service, while a number of reports have called for more money for the key NHS service.A PwC report, commissioned by the Department of Health, said community pharmacy in Northern Ireland is underfunded each year to the tune of £m.Meanwhile, the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee released a report late last year calling for Stormont to resolve the funding crisis.Despite this, the permanent secretary for the Department of Health, Richard Pengelly, said he disagreed with the findings of the PwC report.Community pharmacist Loretto McManus said: Morale in the sector is at an all-time low, so the result of this ballot is no surprise.The refusal by the Department to acknowledge that there are serious issues in our sector is a signicant problem and has led us to this outcome.Dispensing medicines is a role that is critical in maintaining the health of all the patients in our communities.It requires focus and attention to detail, when we have reached a point where we are now working excessive hours and the pharmacist#s health and mental wellbeing is compromised due to the unrelenting pressures, then we have serious concerns for patient safety that need to be put right immediately.Expert reports on transforming our health service say we must enhance community services to keep people out of hospital.The refusal to properly resource and support services like community pharmacy is a total contradiction of this.Meanwhile, Health Minister Robin Swann has said he is due to meet with Community Pharmacy NI in the coming weeks, and urged it to reconsider plans for industrial action.Its announcement of planned industrial action is regrettable and surprising, he said.I am very aware of the challenges within community pharmacy, including the need for greater funding certainty.My Department has been working with Community Pharmacy Northern Ireland on a programme of reform including new services, development of the pharmacy workforce, and updated arrangements for reimbursing community pharmacists for medicines dispensed.I want to assure patients that contingency measures will be developed to minimise the impact of any industrial action.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus: Five Northern Ireland schools take precautionary measures after trips to ItalyFermanagh village in shock after body of Tommy Kelly found in Donegal drainCoronavirus will spread to Northern Ireland, warns medical expert as Italy confirms seventh death after European outbreakNorthern Ireland braced for more snow and ice after weather forces nearly  schools to close their doorsPara turned Provo Paddy O#Kane #centrally involved# in Scottish soldiers# murders, claims BBC Spotlight,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It#s going to be very dficult because it is bureaucracy and it does limit our competitiveness.He said any extra red tape and likely need for increased infrastructure would be a double whammy in which customers would pay more for a lesser service.Pamela Dennison, chair of the Freight Transport Association Northern Ireland, issued a similar warning.I despair at what#s going to comeJanuary, she said.She said an increased responsibility for paperwork would place considerable pressure on the business: If that paperwork goes wrong, it#s myself and my drivers that will be affected.She said that local hauliers who deliver to both the UK and Ireland were in a very volatile area as they waited to juggle both the Northern Ireland protocol and EU regulations.Any extra costs from the new arrangement, she said, will end up on the consumer#s door and will make it unfeasible to buy goods from Northern Ireland.We will have to very careful how we manage this moving forward, she added.Asked for a message for the Government, she replied: Stop telling businesses what you think they want to hear and tell them what#s going on.The committee later heard from David Phinnemore, professor of European politics at Queen#s University Belfast.He was asked what goods entering Northern Ireland would be considered at risk of being transported to the Irish Republic and therefore subject to a tarf.The starting point is very clear: everything is at risk, he said, until the EU can be persuaded otherwise.Businesses are crying out. The last three years have been about uncertainty.I don#t think you#ll find any economic operator who thinks that this is a good deal for Northern Ireland.The UK was today warned not to renege on the commitments on the Irish protocol as the EU gathered to discuss its position on the imminent trade talks.Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said the EU made a generous and fair offer to the UK which must be honoured. Michel Barnier and the Irish government are at one on this. The withdrawal agreement involves signicant commitments in the context of Northern Ireland through the Irish protocol that both the EU and the UK need to follow through on, Mr Coveney added.His comments follow reports that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ordered his Brexit team to find ways to get around the protocol.Downing Street has insisted, however, it will honour the terms of the deal.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus: Five Northern Ireland schools take precautionary measures after trips to ItalyFermanagh village in shock after body of Tommy Kelly found in Donegal drainCoronavirus will spread to Northern Ireland, warns medical expert as Italy confirms seventh death after European outbreakNorthern Ireland braced for more snow and ice after weather forces nearly  schools to close their doorsPara turned Provo Paddy O#Kane #centrally involved# in Scottish soldiers# murders, claims BBC Spotlight,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Derry featherweight was hoping to upset the odds when he took on British champion Ryan Walsh at the York Hall in London, live on Sky Sports, but despite starting well, lost a unanimous decision.McCullagh caused a stir last week when he arrived at the pre-match press conference with friend and fellow pro Tyrone McKenna dressed as characters from classic s comedy Dumb and Dumber. McCullagh was in the zone come fight night however and he began strongly but was eventually broken down by Walsh who sent him to the canvas twice throughout the fight. Walsh, who has defended the British title six times since  – including stoppage victories over Belfast’s James Tennyson and Marco McCullough, picked McCullagh as his opponent earlier in the week after picking the Golden Ball in a tournament which promises the winner a two-year, six-figure deal.This was always a huge challenge for McCullagh who stepped up in weight and class to take part in this tournament before cruising past Razaq Najib in the quarterfinals. McCullagh edge a cagey first round before clearly taking the second with straight shots down the middle.Keeping out of range, McCullagh continued to keep Walsh at bay in the third and looked more than comfortable in the early stages.It was much closer in the fourth with Walsh getting closer but the cleaner work came from the Irishman, who was again proving his doubters wrong.Disaster then struck for McCullagh however as the bout entered its second half as a right hook caught him and took away his legs completely. Following a stumble around the ring, he found himself flat on his back and seemingly very hurt. However, to his credit, McCullagh got back up and weathered the storm for the remainder of the round. Walsh was building momentum heading into the seventh round, but McCullagh was fighting back, showing he had recovered well from that knockdown. It all changed again at the start of the eighth round as a big right hand at the start followed by a body assault had McCullagh in trouble. It seemed the end was near but again McCullagh fought back and again made it through the round.Knowing he was now well behind on the scorecards, McCullagh attempted a spirited fightback, but all hope of a comeback was ended when he was forced to take another count, falling forward to his knees following a salvo from Walsh.McCullagh answered the bell from the tenth and managed to grit things out, with the contest going all the way to the judges who confirmed Walsh a unanimous decision winner with scores of -, -, and -. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I want any investment in roads to reflect the need across our entire network. I am pleased to announce this road improvement scheme on the Baranailt Road which represents an investment of pound, in the Claudy area. The work will signicantly improve the strength and surface quality of this section of the road network and will serve the local community for many years to come.”The scheme will start near the junction with the Foreglen Road and proceed along Baranailt Road for a distance of . kilometres.To facilitate the resurfacing it will be necessary to operate a road closure for the duration of the work. A two way signed ersion will be available via A Foreglen Road and B Drumrane Road. Access for residents and landowners will be maintained.The Department has programmed the work and traffic management arrangements to minimise any inconvenience, however, drivers should expect some delays and are advised to leave additional time when planning any journeys.Welcoming the news, East Derry SDLP MLA John Dallat said: “It’s important that our roads network, which has degraded over three years without an Executive in place, is broad back up to standard. Investing in infrastructure like this has a positive impact on the lives of local people and I’m delighted that the Minister has made East Derry an early priority.“The SDLP will continue to work hard to deliver on the issues that matter to local people.”Completion of the work by March  is dependent on favourable weather conditions a statement from the Department said.Meanwhile, resurfacing work on the Seacoast Road, Limavady is also underway.The scheme extends from near Burnally Road, Myroe for . kilometres towards Crindle, is expected to be completed by Sunday  March .

As an elected representative who is pro-actively working on behalf of everyone living in our local community, it is always pleasing when having worked with the relevant statutory agencies on issues of major importance to local residents, to have residents concerns fully addressed while ensuring the implementation of a programme of essential work. Addressing the issue of the need to finally complete Magheras Highway To Health by linking footpaths along Crew Road and Station Road, Cllr McGuigan added: I have been given strong assurances that relevant council staff are actively pursuing the need to have this vital issue of public safety addressed in the very near future. Working alongside others including relevant statutory agencies, they are sourcing very much needed public finance to have the project completed. This important issue is being given strong attention at this time. I am very confident that we will soon have the highway to health completed as it is vital for ensuring public safety, healthy living and community well-being. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But before you know it little ‘Mary’ is three years old and you only ever see her at Christmas or on her birthday IF you have time and even then she doesn’t really know who you are.Yes you are working, yes you have your own children, yes you live an hour away etc etc BUT what happened to all those good intentions Good intentions are all well and good, butyou don’t actually do anything well they don’t actually mean anything - it’s the old excuses… could have done, would have done, will do, next time, but in fact you HAVEN’T, DIDN’T and DON’T!I love spending time with my nieces, and my great niece too. I’ve one of them to pick up at twelve o’clock today and I KNOW after she goes home I’ll be hoovering up glitter and sequins for weeks!But when I do collect her, see her as she runs to the door shouting ‘Aunty Jen’ and gives me a huge hug and big smile it makes all the glitter and sequins worthwhile, oh and all the laughing and smiling we’ll do together helps as well! It’s fab being an aunty, and I’m sure it is being an uncle and a godparent too, we can spoil them, treat them, play silly games with them - even have a go on the see saw and slide.We can enjoy going to the cinema and watching the new Disney films, visiting the farm or zoo, making popcorn and snuggling on the couch to watch cartoons, getting messy with paint , dancing around the living room and jumping on the couch to get away from the crocodilesand as they get older doing hair and make up, going on go karts or swimming - great excuse to go on that new slide in the swimming baths .There’s loads of fun to be had together so simply put,you don’t have your niece, nephew or godchild for a visit regularly YOU are the one missing out! Of course I’m not suggesting you should have them every week, every Saturday night .But maybe once every month, six weeks or couple of months for a sleep over - they’ll be so excited.I knowyou’ve got children and so has your brother, sister or friend that this may be hard for you, but maybe you could swop children for the day - then you’ll all get a chance to be that fab aunty, uncle or godparent.Or have your children and your niece, nephew or godchild too - what dference is one more child going to make.Yes parents this means you would have a babysitter but you’ve got to do it for your brother, sister or friend too! As I write quite often, their childhoods go by so fast, it’s the time with you today that creates the bond between you both - this does apply to aunts, uncles and godparents too.As our children become teenagers sometimes they need this ‘other’ trusted and loved adult in their le too - someone to talk to when times are tough, someone to be ‘on their side’, someone to help them make the right choice, a place and person of safety when things are going wrong.And this is what you promised when they were just a baby… ‘I’ll always look out for you, be there for you and be there to help you enjoy the world’.But how will they be able to do thisthey don’t know you, don’t play with you, have days out with you, or sleep overs at your house and only see you at Christmas - evenyou do bring great presents Anyway got to run, off to pick up my niece, take her to McDonald’s for lunch, then the cake shop so she can choose a special cake tor us to share after our tea, then it’s home for glueing, glitter, sequins and paint, before playing Snap, dolls and hairdressers, after that it’s be a bath bomb bath for herthen snuggles with stories before bed!No I won’t be telling her Dad about the sweets and ice cream - it’s my job to enjoy, love AND spoil her! googletag.cmd.push Written by, on Facebook, Me  You @meandyoubyjenni to support the Greater Shantallow Talking To Our Babies, Greater Shantallow Area Partnership.

The Leitrim Road will be open to traffic in the evenings during the week and all weekend.The Department of Infrastructure says that it has programmed the resurfacing work and traffic management arrangements to minimise inconvenience, but warns that drivers should expect some delays and are advised to leave additional time when planning any journeys.Confirmation of the Leitrim Road scheme has been welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and SLieve Croob councillor Hugh Gallagher.Mr McGrath said the resurfacing scheme represents signicant investment in a rural area.He continued: ldquoThere has been concern for some time among many people in South Down that there is a regional disparity between how much investment rural areas have received compared to the more urban counterparts.ldquoI am absolutely delighted that infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon is working to alleviate that. When the Assembly was restored I spoke about how she would work to connect communities. In this instance that is literally what she is achieving. This is win for everyone.Mr McGrath said he looked forward to the completion of the Leitrim Road scheme and asked drivers to be patient as work progresses and use the ersions that will be in place.Cllr Gallagher said while Slieve Croob is a ldquomost beautul area,roads are not up to scratch, no one will enjoy the location.ldquoThis resurfacing scheme is about more than just making the road fit purpose.

before.Some of the artefacts included medieval pottery, animal bones, bronze pins, an Early Christian cross slab and a bronze section of a medieval cross with settings for precious stones.Wooden barrel staves were found at the bottom of one pit and Mr Sloan at the lecture will reveal how they have been dated.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey encouraged all those interested to attend the free event.He said: ldquoThe archaeological excavation revealed some very exciting and unusual objects and shows how important this site was in the medieval period.The attendance at the dig during the summer shows how widespread interest is in archaeology and this talk will provide people with a great opportunity to find out more.The dig was part of a series of projects funded by Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilrsquos PEACE IV programme.The digs were designed to find out more about le in the past, but also to help people understand local history and culture and gain

Ballykinlar.jpg","title":"Ballykinlar community facility unused over power supply issue  ","story":"A COMMUNITY centre in Ballykinlar is lying unused because it has no electricity supply, it emerged this week.Newry, Mourne and Down councillors heard on Monday night that the long awaited Ballykinlar Community Centre has yet to be occupied even though it has been ready since Christmas.The issue is that NIE Networks is having problems getting agreement from the Ministry of Defence to carry out work on its land at the nearby disused army barracks in order to get a mains supply to the council-run facility.The centre, a prefabricated building formerly used by the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service in Downpatrick, was moved to the former Kindle Primary School School site in Ballykinlar.Councillors attending a meeting of the Active and Healthy Communities Committee were told that the connection agreement ldquocould be a long-term problem and the longer the facility is left unoccupied, the more prone it will become to vandalism.They also heard that Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association was ldquovery keen to open the facility with numerous users waiting to move in.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason urged council officers to step in and to seea temporary supply of electricity could provided by generators in the interim.She said: ldquoThe community groups are crying out to use these facilities and a lot of things depend on it such as the allotments and formation of a new Menrsquos Shed.Downpatrick councillor John Trainor also asked the council to see what could be done as he said it was clear that the facility was much needed.Council officer Janine Hillen offered a temporary solution of using pound, to pay for the use of electricity generators until it ran out, which was proposed by Cllr Mason and seconded by Cllr Trainor.If a generator is used to provide electricity to Ballykinlar Community Centre, it will be the second council facility to use this method as a generator is used at the Flying Horse civic amenity centre in Downpatrick.Yesterday Cllr Mason said it was ldquocompletely unacceptable that the Ballykinlar community have been let down on this.ldquoThis community group have worked tirelessly to get this much needed new facility in the village, she remarked. ldquoBoth council officials and County Down Rural Community Network have worked alongside the community to secure funding and resources for the site, but they now find themselves unable to use it due to lack of an electricity connection.ldquoIt is imperative that NIE and the Ministry of Defence overcome any barriers that is stopping this electricity connection.Cllr Mason said South Down MP Chris Hazzard had made representations to the Secretary of State to stress the importance of the community facility for Ballykinlar and to ldquosort this issue as soon as possible.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he would continue to call on the council to get the matter sorted out as soon as possible.ldquoIrsquom very annoyed to think that this much-needed facility is lying idle as the community has been waiting on this for years.ldquoPeople were delighted to have been told that they would get this facility on a site which had been used as a drinking den and itrsquos about time they were able to use it.After the meeting Niall Addis, chairman of the Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association, spoke of his growing frustration at not being able to use the centre.ldquoWe are all so ready to get into the building and use it, said Mr Addis, ldquoApart from our group, the Forever Young pensioners group wants to use it, the Allotments Society, a new Menrsquos Shed and I have at least five people who wish to hold parties at the centre but I canrsquot give them a date when it is opening.Mr Addis said he had to lobby to get the council to allow the contractorrsquos generator to be used to power the councilrsquos sustainable Christmas tree for a few days and he is angry that this was not continued beyond that.ldquoThis is not acceptable and needs to be sorted out, said Mr Addis. ldquoIrsquom calling on the council, NIE

Our aim is to effectively address the childrenrsquos needs and prevent exclusion from the classroom and any distress caused by them not having the coping skills, through no fault of their own.Garry Hanna, chairman of the board of governors, announced that the school will be providing a free-of-charge breakfast club between am and am each morning to working parents who need early morning childcare.He said: ldquoIn order to allow many of our parents greater flexibility with their working arrangements, we will now provide this free service.

Neil Curran was home in ., which was a  second PB for him at this distance. Despite improving on his time, he was non-committal about his performance, feeling that a lack of speed work had left his legs wanting.Runners can be hard on themselves and should remember that performances that they think lack sparkle, may be times that others may only dream of achieving.Jimmyrsquos recceA call had gone out to our members to take part in a recce of the course for the rapidly approaching Jimmyrsquos .It was decided to open this up to all comers and it was a popular move. With representatives from Tels Fitness, Murlough AC, Crossgar Harriers and Down Triathlon Club and some solo runners joining our own crowd, there was a jolly band of nearly  runners hitting the streets.Storm Dennis was a bit of a concern, but having consulted the weather charts it was decided to proceed with caution. In actual fact, although there was a taxing head wind at some points, it was dry until after all ed, so Denis was not able to put off these hardcore folk.They soon warmed up with hot drinks and snacks and the general feeling was that it was a good job, well done. All reported that they were looking forward to the real event with even more anticipation having had the tester.Last One StandingAs usual, on this weekend every year, the Last One Standing take place in Castleward.Admittedly, the organisers donrsquot usually have to consider the elements to any great extent as it is an endurance test of the inidual against whatever arises, but the warnings about the arrival of Storm Dennis meant that extra caution had to be exercised this year.With most of the course on grass or muddy forest tracks and with much of it also under the usually benign shelter of the many trees, consideration of the likely effects of the much heralded Storm Dennis had to be a priority.However, cometh the hour cometh the manwho were undaunted by the prospect of storm force rain and wind in their attempts to attain the coveted title of Last One Standing .I personally have to take my hat off to every one who set out on the journey, which no one knows how long it will take or how far it will be, depending as it does on the persistence and bloody mindedness of those participating.The format is basically that every runner has to be on the start line at  noon on Saturday and they then have to complete the course of . miles within the hour and be on the start line again at pm and so on for every hour thereafter.Anyone who fails to finish within the hour or who fails to be on the start line when the next hour begins is automatically excluded from further participation.So, then it develops into a poker game of who will keep going the longest as hour after hour the field gradually reduces until only one person begins what will be the final lap, which he she has to complete to be declared the Last One Standing.In theory, anyone can win, though there are, like in every branch of sport, those who will attract greater support as favourites because of their previous experience at this type of physical activity. Among those would be the likes of previous winner Peter Cromie, from Omagh and Cork man Eoin Keith, who has won many long distance events both in Ireland and abroad, including setting records over  hours endurance races, where the emphasis is on how far one can travel in the allotted time, unlike this one, where itrsquos a case of how long can one keep going for, knowing that all one hour will yield will be . miles.But they have the stickability factor which is so important in this type of event. And so it came to pass that after completing  laps and . miles that the winner was Peter Cromie, following Eoinrsquos retirement at the end of lap . What a battle this proved.In the absence of any results it is not possible to comment further on how any locals fared, but hopefully Irsquoll have more information next week.Jimmyrsquos If you havenrsquot yet signed up to Jimmyrsquos ,  then you should put it on your to do list asap as it is only four weeks until race day.Entries online at https:athleticsni.org Fixtures Jimmys-Ten- or email info@eastdownac for further information.

Our wedding planner team had to be very well organised to ensure that both grooms and their bridal parties were escorted unseen into separate rooms before the ceremony but it was all worth it. We wish the happy couple well for the future.While the couple are now honeymooning on the Costa Blanca, Shane spoke to the Recorder about what the day meant to them and their families.ldquoIt was absolutely brilliant and we canrsquot thank our family and friends for being so supportive, he said.ldquoIt means so much to Connor and I and our families that we are now married and that is legally recognised. Our families came together so well and have been really supportive from day one when we first came out.

Only the re-opening of the Stormont Executive could have prevented it becoming law and the Executive did notuntil after the necessary deadline date last October.Shane explained: ldquoWe registered for a civil partnership for our date last week but then when the law was passed on January , we gave our  days notice to the registry office that we were going to be married rather than the civil partnership. it was all go from then.ldquoWe did think of getting married in England as Connor is originally from there but my grandmother Kathleen Robinson is coming  this year and we couldnrsquot expect her to get on a plane to come to England.However, the couple did not expect their wedding to attract so much media attention as they were interviewed live on the Nolan Show on BBC One Northern Ireland after the ceremony.Another same-sex couple, Robyn Peoples and Sharni Edwards, married in Carrickfergus the day before Shane and Connor.BBC Breakfast initially asked themthey could cover their wedding by contacting Hugh McCannrsquos first.Shane explained: ldquoWe turned them down at the start as we were afraid of any backlash, but then the producer from the Nolan Show actually got in contact with our photographer so we were approached by them from every angle. We only agreed to appear on the show just two days before the wedding.Shane and Connor realise that while many people will celebrate their union, there is still a large group of people in Northern Ireland who remain opposed to same-sex marriage.But for them, it was just about being seen as a couple like everyone .ldquoWe just wanted to be married and didnrsquot carewe were the first, said Shane.ldquoObviously now we know we are the first male couple.

He said it is important this happens as soon as possible.ldquoI am fed up ringing NI Water about this issue, the businessman declared.ldquoI have been given countless reference numbers by officials but no one is doing anything about this. The business community at this part of Ballynahinch should not have to put out sand bags every time there is heavy rain.Mr Comiskey described last Saturdayrsquos flooding incident as ldquoserious and revealed that he had to close a metal shutter at the entrance to the bar to prevent a mix of rain water and sewage from entering the premises.ldquoThis problem needs to be sorted as the issue impacts on a number of businesses. Six months ago the local council gave us sand bags and while a drainage firm has examined the drains on several occasions, its staff have told us that there is nothing that they can do, he said.Mr Comiskey said there is speculation locally that debris from work on Ballynahinchrsquos public realm scheme which was completed several years ago may be causing blockage.He also revealed that the volume of water being forced up through drains is powerful enough to lt heavy metal covers which could damage passing cars.Mr Comiskey added: ldquoWhen the drain overflows you can see raw sewage mixed with storm water. Every time there is heavy rain we have to be on our guard. We have been flooded in the past and do not want this to happen again.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is seeking an urgent meeting with NI Water engineers to discuss the flooding issue.He said there is increasing concern about the problem at the Main Street junction with Lisburn Street where there is a combined sewer which deals with rain water and raw sewage.ldquoBusiness owners should not be forced to take measures to protect their properties with sand bags when there is heavy rain. While the storm drains at this part of Ballynahinch have been cleared with powerful water jets, the problem continues to persist.ldquoWe cannot continue to allow raw sewage to spew out of storm drains next to businesses. The current situation is unacceptable and must be addressed.The Rowallane politician has also asked that work to resolve the combined sewer issue must be carried out in the evening to minimise the disruption that it will inevitably have on town centre traffic.Cllr Walker added: ldquoGiven the fact that raw sewage is involved, this issue must be dealt with immediately. Every time there is heavy rain, business owners are running for sand bags in order to protect their properties. They should not have to live like this.A spokeswoman for NI Water said that its wastewater team has confirmed that the combined sewer is operating ldquonormally and that the issue at Lisburn Street in Ballynahinch is a matter for the Department for Infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Strangford.jpg","title":"Strangford residents in local boost  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Strangford can now keep up to date with all that is happening in the village, thanks to a boost from the Big Lottery Fund.It is financing a new village noticeboard, website and newsletter to keep everyone in Strangford abreast of all that is going on.Given the many clubs and societies in Strangford mdash which currently number  mdashthe villagersquos residentsrsquo group is delighted with the Big Lottery Fundrsquos cash windfall which ensures that it can deliver in its vow to improve communication.Group member Jenner OrsquoReilly has been writing feature articles in the newsletter about inidual residents and it has been a great hit.

Some of the volunteer workers from ious countries assigned to this duty dreaded the ominous ‘pancake day’ as it often had its share of disasters, giving them the in-house nickname of ‘panic cakes’! In the ious hotel and catering establishments I have worked in over the years, eventhey were secular, there was always the obligatory ‘Pancake Day’ or ‘Shrove Tuesday,’ even though the tradition is linked to the fasting of Lent that begins the following day on Ash Wednesday observed by Protestant and Catholic denominations as a precursor to Easter.

It was a day to use up eggs, milk and other rich foods before the  day fasting period.This gave rise to the name ‘carnival’ coming from the Latin ‘carnem lee’and for others ‘Mardi Gras’ meaning ‘Fat Tuesday.’ Pope Gregoryissued the following rule to Augustine in Canterbury: “We abstain from flesh, meat, and from all things that come from flesh, as milk, cheese and eggs.” Ash is still daubed on the foreheads of participants on Ash Wednesday in some denominations from burnt palm fronds made into crosses from the previous year, almost reminiscent of some religious practices in India, but which was linked to the time of penitence and confession.I have never panicked making pancakes, but I do question whether Jesus would actually require this practice from anyone who chooses to follow Him  Certainly there were no such traditions in the early church. Jesus fasted in the wilderness for us. We don’t need to do it ourselves. Fasting can come freely at any time of the year, but not by ecclesiastical obligation. Besides, following Him and not religious traditions invented by men is the best recipe for success in my book.Colin Nevin, Chef, Israel -"},{"url":null,"title":"stormont mlas returned work agreeing deal read christmas wish list and now they are holding out begging bowl ","story":"Man’s body found lying on shoreline of NI town - post mortem to be carried outArmy veteran who took his own le a ‘victim of the IRA’NewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensNewsOpinionLettersStormont MLAs ed to work by agreeing a deal that read like a Christmas wish list, and now they are holding out a begging bowlLast week saw the infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon publicly complain that she does not have enough money in her budget to keep the lights on.By The NewsroomTuesday, th February , : pm\"\"Letter to the editorWith an annual budget of just shy of £m for revenue andcapital, it is hard to take her seriously.It seems instead that she does not want to prioritise it over other aspects of the remit she now holds.On the one hand, infrastructure is vital to the Northern Ireland economy and it needs spending for sure.Our roads, rail, broadband and public transport networks keep the place moving.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The pupils were then asked to redesign the maps by using their knowledge of the local area. They identied key landmarks, short cuts and potential barriers to walking and cycling.The pupils also developed a set of symbols and a map key which will be used in the new map.Sustrans also held a parent engagement workshop where they invited families to identy routes that they and their children use.Sustrans will produce a bilingual pocket-sized travel map which will be available to students, staff and parents for free. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this. I just love looking after people.ldquoItrsquos because of that choice to join the Princes Trust volunteers that I ended up where I am, so I genuinely do thank him for taming a very wayward -year-old.Describing her job at Marie Curie, Kathryn said: ldquoI love it here. Therersquos no comparison. You can give that  percent every sht. And wersquove got a cracking view. The sun rises and then the moon rises. We get to see it all across the water. Itrsquos gorgeous.Following the tour, the prince ended his visit at a reception where he met actor and Marie Curie ambassador, Suzanna Packer.In a brief speech, he commended the staff and volunteers for their dedication which he called lsquotruly remarkable.rsquoHe then unveiled a plaque to commemorate his visit and cut a daffodil-themed cake made by local Michelin-starred chef, James Sommerin.Angelina Hall and Cathy OrsquoDoherty, co-owners of Glass By Design at Station Approach, were commissioned to design and produce the plaque.ldquoIt was an honour for us as local artists to be asked to make this, said Cathy. ldquoItrsquos something which is going to be here for people to enjoy.His Royal Highness was also the first person to sign the charityrsquos Great Big Daffodil - a -foot tall model with paper books in the shape of petals which will start a UK wide tour this week.The Great Daffodil Appeal is an opportunity for people to share their stories, memories, or tributes to a loved one.After signing the book and cutting the cake, Charles gave a final farewell to the staff who had gathered to see him and left with his entourage.The prince met with flood victims in Pontypridd later that afternoon.His trip to South Wales also included engagements at the CAF train factory in Newport, the Aston Martin Lagonda factory in St. Athan, Barry, and the British Airways Maintenance Centre in Cardf. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers.

Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
