Many firms have been held back over batteries overheating, which is dangerous as well as damaging devices.Samsung had to recall millions of phones in 2016 after batteries overheated, damaging the device – with some even bursting into flames after getting too hot. The Korean giant recalled 2.5 million handsets at a cost of billions of pounds.Oppo’s new technology has been in development since 2014.Neil Monger, Oppo’s UK product manager, said: ‘We have been working on Vooc technology since 2014. It was relatively fast back then and it has carried on evolving.‘It’s not just about speed – it is also about doing it in a way that is safe for our customers. For example, if you just try to put more power into a battery without the relevant safeguards, it may cause longer-term battery damage that causes it to degrade quicker over time. We test and test to avoid that.’He added: ‘These new versions of SuperVooc have 13 temperature sensors installed in the phone to monitor the charging status in real-time. It reduces the chances of overheating and prevents other abnormalities.‘If someone is keeping a phone for two or three years, they need to know the battery will last. A good battery will retain 80 per cent of its capacity after 800 charges. Ours do that after 1,600.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Welcome Crufts clown gets laugh","story":"Share this article Three of Michelle Smee\u0027s dogs – Bolt, aged six, Sunny, two, and 11-month-old puppy Jay – will be among the 32 Pumiks to compete. The support teacher from Bristol said: \u0027They are lively, intelligent, funny, quirky, and even though they look cute with their big fluffy ears, they need lots of stimulation and exercise.

If the war continues to escalate and continues into the medium term, Ireland will be expected to host about 2 per cent of all refugees who have been forced to leave their home country.On that basis, the Government has begun scenario planning based on a minimum of 20,000 Ukrainian refugees arriving in Ireland.Last night Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the Government is discussing opening an online portal or register where people can pledge how they can help the new arrivals, whether this is through providing accommodation or other skills,.Any Ukrainian people arriving in Ireland will need support, especially young children who will attend Irish schools, according to Mr Martin. “This will be challenging. The first wave of those coming into Ireland are meeting friends and staying with friends.”This will result in the biggest displacement of people on the European continent since the second World War, he added, and Irish people who want to help should make cash donations to the Irish Red Cross. He was speaking on the Late Late show where more than €3 million was raised for the charity. The Government donated €10 million last week to United Nations organisations at the front line and another €10 million will be donated this week, said the Taoiseach. Speaking on Friday afternoon, Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris said he would not be surprised if the figure coming in would easily exceed 1,000 by next week.Government sources said it was not expected that a large number of refugees would arrive in Ireland in the coming weeks and the figure of 600 fell within expectations.There are an estimated 4,000 Ukrainian-born people living in Ireland at present and, in the initial stages, Ukrainian refugees arriving into Ireland will go to relatives.A source said virtually all of the 621 people who have arrived have support networks of family and friends in Ireland and have not sought any help from the State so far.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"over one third of north s population hold irish passport","story":"Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, was due to pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the UK withdrew from the EU.  More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics europe s turning point","story":"Russia\u0027s invasion of Ukraine has brought about enormous changes in European policy in an incredibly short space of time.

Health experts said around 15 per cent of the city’s 7.4 million residents are already infected.The comments by chief secretary John Lee on his blog, came as supermarket shelves were stripped for a seventh consecutive day, with anxious residents stocking up on products left on shelves from tofu and soy sauce to frozen vegetables.As infections and deaths hit record highs, Hong Kong has implemented its most draconian restrictions, with restrictions on public gatherings of more than two people, most venues closed and flights banned into the city from countries including the United States and Britain.The government has repeatedly tried to reassure residents after widespread chaos this week due to authorities’ mixed messaging over whether a city-wide lockdown would take place and the almost daily tweaking of Covid rules.While city leader Carrie Lam has said the Chinese-ruled hub will not have a full-blown lockdown during the mass testing, residents remain unnerved about what to expect.The former British colony has had more than 470,000 Covid infections. Most of the roughly 1,800 deaths have been in the past two weeks, many of them unvaccinated elderly residents as infections have spread in hundreds of nursing homes.The surge in infections has crippled manpower in the healthcare system, for public transport, mall operators as well as postal services, supermarkets and pharmacies.Many restaurants and stores have been shuttered with main districts eerily quiet and few residents out in typically busy neighbourhoods. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"putin holds talks with macron russian tv reports","story":"A demonstrator holds a sign showing a picture of Russian president Vladimir Putin during a rally in support of Ukraine in Los Angeles, California, on March 5th.  2022.

Ankara has called Russia’s invasion unacceptable and offered to host talks, but has opposed sanctions on Moscow.In a statement after a one-hour phone call, the Turkish presidency said Mr Erdogan told Mr Putin that Turkey was ready to contribute to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.“President Erdogan, who said an immediate ceasefire will not only ease humanitarian concerns in the region but also give the search for a political solution an opportunity, renewed his call of ‘let’s pave the way for peace together’,” his office said.“Erdogan emphasised the importance of taking urgent steps to achieve a ceasefire, open humanitarian corridors and sign a peace agreement,” it said.The Kremlin said Mr Putin told Mr Erdogan that Russia would only halt its military operation if Ukraine stopped fighting and if Moscow’s demand were met, adding the operation was going to plan.Russia calls its assault a “special military operation”. It has uprooted more than 1.5 million people, in what the United Nations says is the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War Two.Turkey has said it would be “naive” to expect results from the Ukraine-Russia negotiations while the fighting continues. Turkey’s defence minister on Sunday said an urgent ceasefire was needed so Ankara could evacuate its citizens from Ukraine.Mr Erdogan, who has called Mr Putin a “friend”, had last spoken to the Russian leader on Feb. 23, a day before Russia launched its invasion. The call makes Erdogan the third NATO leader to speak to Putin since his offensive, following the leaders of Germany and France.While forging close ties with Russia on defence, trade and energy, and hosting millions of Russian tourists every year, Turkey has also sold drones to Ukraine, angering Moscow, and opposes Russian policies in Syria and Libya, as well as its 2014 annexation of Crimea.Turkey has said it wants to bring together foreign ministers from Ukraine and Russia for talks at a diplomacy forum next week in southern Turkey.

alarming models abandoned objectivity","story":"Scientists abandoned their objectivity, misled with alarming models and failed to appreciate the damage lockdown would cause, a government adviser has claimed in a damning indictment of Britain’s pandemic response.Prof Mark Woolhouse, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M), said that the Government’s advisory system was dominated by clinicians and public health specialists who “weren’t looking at the bigger picture”.In his memoir, The Year The World Went Mad, Prof Woolhouse claimed that lockdowns “had surprisingly little effect” and just “deferred the problem to another day, at great cost”.He argued that Spi-M was set up to tackle the wrong disease, influenza, and that early models were based on flu dynamics, and so mistakenly thought schools were a major driver while underrepresenting the impact of shielding.Prof Woolhouse says he was “extremely sceptical” about the Imperial College report from March 16 2020 that claimed more than 500,000 people could die without intervention, but The  revealed last week that, at the time, modellers were still “uncertain” of case numbers “due to data limitations”.The figures, published a week before lockdown was announced, led to an about-turn from the Government.Scepticism over figures leading to first lockdown“It was perfectly obvious that no one could predict the course of the epidemic over such a long timescale, so what was the point of publishing those outputs?” wrote Prof Woolhouse.“The worst-case epidemic is one in which the virus is allowed to spread in the absence of any countermeasures at all. It’s useful to know how big that epidemic would be, but it would never happen in practice. It is inconceivable that we would carry on as normal while hundreds of thousands of people were dying.”Imperial College London published an analysis the following June, claiming that lockdown had saved nearly half a million lives in Britain.However, Sweden managed to bring its epidemic under control without lockdown, leaving Imperial College to conclude that it was Sweden’s ban on mass gatherings that played the decisive role – even while arguing it had not been enough in other countries.“The conclusion wasn’t remotely plausible,” wrote Prof Woolhouse. “Analyses by other researchers came up with quite different conclusions that the UK epidemic was already in decline before lockdown took effect.“I expect this debate will rumble on for years, but I doubt anyone would claim now that the Mar 23 lockdown saved anywhere near half a million lives. Anyone who supported lockdown on the basis of the half-million figure was misled.”An inquiry into the pandemic response is due to begin this spring. However, research is increasingly suggesting that lockdown was not needed because the public naturally begins social distancing when they see cases rise, or friends and family becoming infected.This week, modellers told the Commons science and technology select committee that many of the recent models were wrong because they had failed to factor in these behavioural shifts.Prof Graham Medley, the chairman of Spi-M, told MPs: “Human behaviour is very difficult to predict. If you could do it, then you would make a fortune on the stock exchange. We haven’t included that, and maybe that’s an error. But on the other hand, we’ve seen dramatic behaviour changes which were completely unforeseen.”Spi-M first met in Jan 2020, and modelling from the group was frequently cited by politicians to justify imposing new measures.Yet in his memoir, Prof Woolhouse said that scientific advisers had given too much weight to preventing deaths from coronavirus, while dismissing the indirect harms of lockdown, such as damage to education, mental health, the economy and the rest of the NHS.He said that Britain is likely to be paying for the mistakes of lockdown “for a generation or more”.“The public health benefits were overestimated, skewing the argument in favour of that course, however damaging it was,” he added.“Will the cure turn out to be worse than the disease? It is still early days for doing the reckoning but the moments are not good.”BBC accused of ‘over-egging Covid risks’Prof Woolhouse also accused the BBC of over-egging the risks from Covid and that said scientists had abandoned their objectivity by wading into policy.“It became routine during the pandemic for scientific advisers and commentators to push for one policy or another,” he wrote.“As citizens, they have every right to do that. But when there is a constant stream of government scientific advisers in the media calling for a lockdown, as there was during the second wave in Oct 2020, then we have crossed a line.”Prof Woolhouse also said it was an “awkward” truth that the people who benefited most from suppression of the virus, such as the elderly and vulnerable, were not the group that suffered most from the impact of lockdown: young people and low-income workers.“Even before the UK first went into lockdown in Mar 2020, we knew that novel coronavirus was far more dangerous to the elderly, the frail and the infirm than to healthy young adults and children,” he added.“That should have shaped our response. Instead, the UK administrations continued to act as though everyone was equally at risk. They even actively promoted this misinterpretation to try to bolster acceptance to a lockdown strategy.”The Year The World Went Mad is published by Sandstone PressMore from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Terrified civilians run for their lives as rocket attacks target bridge they were sheltering underFrom the front line: Ukrainian fighter\u0026#39s diary of a week at warDon’t lecture me on plight of refugees, says Dominic RaabScreaming in fear, running for their lives: Civilians e for cover as bombs fall on their only route out of IrpinLatest pictures from Ukraine: Warning it could be \u0026#39months, if not years\u0026#39 before war ends The New York Times should give ‘reckless’ Britain a breakMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"buses sit empty mariupols evacuation proved false hope left","story":"The drivers waited for the order all day, their yellow school buses lined up on Zaporizhzhya’s Dnieper embankment facing south, towards the war.They were meant to be the rescue mission: gathered together at short notice to evacuate hundreds of civilians from Russia’s brutal siege of the port city of Mariupol.But as darkness fell, they had moved nowhere.A promised ceasefire had failed. The buses remained stationary. And the civilians remained trapped inside what has become one of the most violent battles of the 10-day old Russian invasion of Ukraine.Videos and witness testimony from Mariupol, which was surrounded by Russian forces on Tuesday, paint a picture of unrelenting brutality.Mangled corpses lie uncollected on the ground. Buildings have been pulverised by salvos of missiles, rockets and artillery fire. There is no water or electricity.Terrified residents boil snow to make drinking water and cower in basements.  But on Saturday, a glimmer of hope emerged. Russian forces announced that they would grant a temporary ceasefire to the city, as well as to the besieged town of Volnovakha, to allow the evacuation of civilians - principally, women, children and the elderly.It was presented as a gesture of humanity in an increasingly merciless conflict that has shocked the world.But within hours, those hopes were dashed. Ukrainian authorities reported that the Russians had breached the ceasefire and were continuing to rain down shells and missiles on Mariupol and Volnovakha. The evacuation was suspended.Vadim Boichenko, the mayor, said in a statement that the Russian ministry of defence promised early on Saturday morning to ceasefire along roads leading to the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhia, 140 miles northwest.“Unfortunately at the moment we were ready, the Russian army began a bombardment of the very roads we were meant to take. In other words, there is no ceasefire,” he said in a video address cancelling the evacuation.He promised that he would continue talks and would announce a new evacuation as soon as a ceasefire was secured.Evacuees were already gathering at three designated evacuation points in the city when the move was cancelled. They were urged to return to bomb shelters as local officials said the assault on Mariupol continued.“The Russians are continuing to bomb us and use artillery. It’s crazy,” said Serhiy Orlov, Mr Boichenko’s deputy.“There is no ceasefire in Mariupol and there is no ceasefire all along the route. Our civilians are ready to escape but they cannot escape under shelling.”The Ministry of Defence yesterday said Russia\u0027s offer to let civilians evacuate was “likely a deflection” to reduce international condemnation and gather its forces for a renewed offensive. Those civilians who were able to escape described the horror of enduring cold, darkness and primal fear amid the rubble and twisted metal.Fleeing the city was a “suicide mission”, Diana Berg, who escaped Mariupol on Thursday, told the BBC.It was a “miracle” that she and her husband had survived, she said. They had to drive at speed between Russian armoured vehicles, thinking that at any moment they would be fired on.“We just squeezed between two of them very fast. They pointed their (weapons) at us, but they didn’t fire.”Schools and hospitals have been shelled, there is no heat or running water, and petrol stations have run out of fuel.“Mariupol was a resistance symbol - it was a sign of how Ukraine is not giving up,” said Ms Berg.She believes Russian objectives go far beyond seizing the city, which is home to around 450,000 people. “They don’t want to occupy it. They don’t want it to surrender. They just want it dead.”Even if they had made it to Zaporizhzhya, it would not have meant safety.The Russian army is just 30 miles away from there and is widely expected to try to seize the city’s strategic bridges and helicopter factory in the next stage of its advance.In scenes reminiscent of the Second World War, hundreds queued on the freezing platform at the city’s main train station on Saturday to wait for evacuation trains headed west.The long evacuation trains are free and require no ticket - all you have to do is get yourself to the station and hope there is a space.But there is no telling when one will arrive, and when they do they are often already crowded with refugees from elsewhere.“What is there to say. It’s an absolute nightmare,” said a 69-year-old woman travelling with her 15-year-old grandson and a Yorkshire terrier.When the three o’clock train rolled in an hour late, crowds rushed from door to door looking for a carriage with some space.Women and children screamed as they were separated in the crush.A visibly distressed soldier carrying a Kalashnikov grabbed a mother holding a baby and forced a corridor through the crowd for her.“This way, this way, children first!” He shouted at another young family. They cottoned on and hurried behind him.  “Enough!” screamed a female train guard as she tried to push back a woman clinging to the steps. “I said enough! There is no more room.”She slammed the door shut, and several children burst into tears.Ten minutes later, she relented and reopened the door. She let five more people on before again having to physically push someone back down the steps.“There’s not space! What’s with the suitcase? This is for refugees, not tourists,” she shouted as a man tried to push a large bag on after his family.The rule is women and children first, and able-bodied men are anyway banned from leaving the country.But amid the chaos, it was impossible for fathers to make even painful, hurried goodbyes.It was a horrible scene to watch. And the panic is understandable.  Zaporizhzhya, an ancient Cossack capital on the Dneiper river, has so far been spared the worst of the war.But everyone has seen footage from Kharkiv, Mariupol and Kyiv circulating on the Telegram messaging app.There is no room for illusion about the realities of a modern siege.Video footage posted on social media by inhabitants of Mariupol shows the facades of apartment blocks ripped apart by shells, a shopping mall burned down and a market incinerated.“The shelling is constant and random,” said one woman. “People come out onto the streets to make fires and warm up. When you are on the streets, at any moment a rocket can land next to you.”The grim testimony came as the Russian defence ministry said that a broad offensive would continue in Ukraine, where it denies targeting civilians or invading, calling its actions a “special military operation”.Russian forces were carrying out strikes on military infrastructure and forces from separatist-held Donetsk were tightening the encirclement of Mariupol, Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said.Aid agencies have warned of a humanitarian disaster across the country. The number of refugees could rise to 1.5 million by the end of Sunday from a current 1.3 million, said the head of the United Nations refugee agency.Ukraine says Russian forces have focused efforts on encircling Kyiv and Kharkiv, the second-biggest city, while aiming to establish a land bridge to Crimea.Kyiv, in the path of a Russian armoured column that has been stalled outside the Ukrainian capital for days, was again under attack, with explosions audible from the city centre.Mariupol is a key strategic target for Russian forces. It lies between territory held by Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas region and the Crimean peninsula, which was annexed by Moscow in 2014.To open a land corridor from mainland Russia to Crimea, it must be captured.The city has been under attack since the start of the Russian invasion on February 24 and is the last major population centre still held by Ukrainian forces on the Sea of Azov.But despite being surrounded, the Ukrainians have refused to surrender.The defenders trapped inside include a number of British volunteers serving in the Ukrainian marines.“Last night the shelling was harder and closer,” said a member of Medecins Sans Frontieres, who is trapped in the city.“We collected snow and rainwater yesterday to have some utility water. “Multiple grocery stores were destroyed by missiles and the remaining things were taken by people in desperate need. Still no power, water, heating or mobile connection. Pharmacies are out of medicine.”One 16-year-old boy was killed when a Russian shell exploded on the field where he was playing football. The damage to Volnovakha, an ethnic-Greek town between Mariupol and Donetsk, is, if anything, even worse.Inhabitants said that around 90 per cent of buildings had been damaged or destroyed by Russian mortars, artillery fire and missile strikes.Dmytro Lubinets, a local MP, said bodies lay strewn around the town.Denys Tsutsayev, a volunteer who was trying to coordinate the evacuation from Volnovakha, said: “There are problems with water, power. There are so many people without any heating. There is a very bad connection in the area so it’s difficult to reach people.”Marina Gasanova, who lives in a village near Volnovakha, said her husband was driving back and forth trying to evacuate people. “The situation in the city is very scary, there is almost nothing left. My husband said, ‘I drive in, there is a car standing there, when I come back again, the car is on fire.’ There are corpses lying around, torn off arms, torn off legs.”The International Committee of the Red Cross said it understood that the evacuation of civilians from Mariupol and Volnovakha would not resume on Saturday.“We remain in dialogue with the parties about the safe passage of civilians from different cities affected by the conflict,” the ICRC said in a statement.“The scenes in Mariupol and in other cities today are heart-breaking. Any initiative from the parties that gives civilians a respite from the violence and allows them to voluntarily leave for safer areas is welcome.”Those are exactly the scenes that the people of Zaporizhia fear will soon be visited on their own city.As the train pulled out of the station there late on Saturday, the unlucky ones stood crestfallen on the platform. It had started to snow.“Wait for the next one? That’s the second f—ing train we’ve missed,” shouted one mother, losing her temper in front of her children.A man shushed her. A woman in her forties with teenage daughters fought back tears.Kirill Medvedev ignored the screaming and sat on a suitcase, rocking his distraught four-year-old son Roma on his knee.“He’s alright. Just scared by the crowd,” he said when the boy had quietened down.‘What happens next?’He sent Roma off for a walk with his 10-year-old sister Margarita and their grandmother and took the opportunity for a sly smoke.Like most men here, he was resigned to staying behind but hoped at least to be able to take his girlfriend Alisa and their children as far as Lviv before coming back.“It’s women and children first though, so I don’t know if I’ll get on,” he said. “What happens next? They will decide in Lviv.”“Personally, I just don’t want the children to see this,” he said, meaning the war gripping Mariupol to the south.“I honestly don’t know what is going to happen here. But they say their tanks and APCs are already outside the city.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Terrified civilians run for their lives as rocket attacks target bridge they were sheltering underFrom the front line: Ukrainian fighter\u0026#39s diary of a week at warDon’t lecture me on plight of refugees, says Dominic RaabScreaming in fear, running for their lives: Civilians e for cover as bombs fall on their only route out of IrpinLatest pictures from Ukraine: Warning it could be \u0026#39months, if not years\u0026#39 before war ends The New York Times should give ‘reckless’ Britain a breakMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"11 ways tory cost living","story":" ways Tory cost-of-living crisis will squeeze your family next monthEnergy bills are rising along with National Insurance, Council Tax, rail fares and inflation - while other help is frozen, wages suffer a real-terms cut and you have to pay for Covid tests.

Wages for teachers and NHS staff, benefits and pensions are all set to rise by less than inflation, leaving you with less disposable income. And those paying student loans are hit with a aposstealthapos rise. Tory ministers announced a £ council tax discount this April for people in Band A-D homes in England. But it won’t touch the sides of the energy bills price rise, let alone all other squeezes as the country starts paying for Covid.  Another £ “rebate” is really just a loan that has to be paid back out of future bills and won’t arrive until October. The minimum wage for over-s is rising from £. to £. an hour, but could also be cancelled out by the squeeze. Boris Johnson is currently avoiding much political pain over the price rises due to the focus on the war in Ukraine.But that won’t stop them hitting your wallet or your family… . Energy bills Regulator Ofgem confirmed the energy price cap will increase to a record £, for a typical household following soaring gas prices. Around million Brits on iable tarfs will be hit with a £ rise to the average annual bill overnight on April . Those on fixed tarfs will be hit by rises when their fixed-rate period ends. Rishi Sunak has announced plans to help, which include people living in bands A to D getting £ discount on their council tax in England, and a £ rebate off energy bills in October.But Labour has branded him the loan shark Chancellor as the rebate is effectively a loan which will need to be repaid over five years. The discount will be clawed back from people’s bills in equal £ instalments from . Pressure will build on the Government to act again in October, when a second hike is expected. The Chancellor admitted annual bills could rise more than £, this year.  . National Insurance riseFrom April, a £bn rise in National Insurance will hit working people as the Treasury looks to cut Covid backlogs in the NHS and begin funding social care.It will mean that employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay .p more in the pound for National Insurance from April  - from % to .%. A worker on £, a year pays an extra £ in tax. Someone on £, will pay £ more. People earning under £, a year, or £ a month, will not have to pay National Insurance or the new levy. Those supportive of Boris Johnson argue the levy is progressive as the wealthier pay more. But Tory backbenchers hostile to new taxes baulk at the plans as the tax burden hits its highest in decades. . Inflation and interest rates UK inflation has hit .% and Britons are beginning to feel the squeeze as the cost of food, energy and transport rises at the fastest for three decades. This means the same pound in your pocket buys you less in bread or fuel.And both are products that could rise in price further due to the war between oil giant Russia and wheat-producing Ukraine. Meanwhile the Bank of England hiked interest rates earlier this month to .% in the first back-to-back increase since . This will mean mortgage rates become more expensive, an overnight rise to the monthly payments for people on standard iable rates.Mr Sunak insists inflation is a global problem post-Covid, but whether this line will hold remains to be seen.  . Council tax rise Most of England’s families will be hit with an eye-watering Council Tax rise of % or more in April, Mirror research reveals. The vast majority of cash-strapped town, city and county halls are imposing the maximum possible hike on April . Of  councils that run social care, the Mirror found  were planning rises of .% - the maximum normally allowed this year. And a further  planned rises higher than .%, by using allowances that were unused in previous years. Six of those authorities - Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Sandwell, Oxfordshire, Surrey and Rutland - are set to impose a .% hike. In Rutland that will raise a Band D bill by £, wiping out much of a £ discount that is meant to help pay rising energy bills. Search for your council tax rise by postcode below.  . Covid tests From April  the vast majority of people must paythey want a Covid lateral flow test - eventhey have a cough and fever. No has said spending £bn a month on free tests is not an effective use of taxpayers’ money at this point. This has prompted a furious row with Labour, some medics and the Scottish and Welsh governments - which will get no new moneythey want to continue free tests. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but No is seeking a regulated market where each test costs a low single-figure number of pounds. This suggests a box of seven could cost £-.Asymptomatic tests for NHS workers will be made available but not routinely, only as a surge effort where thereaposs an outbreak. But they will be available for care home residents. Exact lists of those eligible are being drawn up.. Student loans aposstealth taxapos Millions will be forced to pay more on their student loans under what has been branded a “stealth tax rise”. Student loan repayment thresholds will be frozen from April  after plans to raise them by .% were scrapped. That means graduates will have to shell out more of their disposable income as wages and prices rise with inflation. The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies warned the freeze will cost £k earners £ a year more than they expected. IFS senior economist Ben Waltmann said it was “a further hit to real incomes”, adding it “effectively constitutes a tax rise by stealth on graduates with middling earnings.” It gets worse further in the future. Students starting university next year will begin paying off their loans when they earn more than £, - down from the existing £,-a-year threshold. And theof time to repay their debt will be extended to  years, up from . The IFS said this will leave poorer graduates paying £, more over their letimes.  . Income tax goes up Rishi Sunak chose to freeze income tax thresholds at a time when inflation is climbing at frightening speed. Youaposll still pay % on earnings over £,, and % on earnings over £,, evenaverage wages rise. According to the Commons library, more than a million more people will be paying a higher rate of income tax by . It will also lead to around . million more workers having their earnings going over the % tax threshold and almost . million more people will be brought into paying the basic level of income tax. The Treasury can expect to net £bn from the move. But, when the impact arrives for Brits, calls from backbenchers for the Government to change course could grow. . Real terms cut to welfare and pensionsBenefits like Universal Credit and pension rates will both rise by .%, £. a month and £. a week respectively.Tory MPs pushed through the plans last month - saying it was in line with inflation. But it’s only in line with what inflation was last Autumn, before prices began to soar at an alarming rate. Meanwhile the pensions triple lock - which would have raised the state pension by more than % - was suspended. Many are warning that this will severely exacerbate the cost-of-living crisis for those who are struggling the most. Foodbank use is expected to climb as a result and the Government is no doubt braced for more interventions from high-profile campaigners such as Man U footballer Marcus Rashford.  . A real-terms cut to childcare help Poor parents will be hit hard by April’s cost-of-living crisis as Tory ministers refuse to raise a crucial childcare allowance - despite soaring inflation. Parents on Universal Credit can claim back % of childcare costs, but only up to a £.-a-month cap - which has not changed since  and is not rising in April. Campaigner and working mum to a four-year-old and Gemma Widdowfield, , told MPs: “We’re all in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis. We’re all feeling the pinch. “My childcare’s going up slightly but the Universal Credit cap isn’t going up at all… that’s going to be passed on to us.” . Real terms cuts to pay - including for NHS and teachers Inflation also means that many planned rises to public sector wages - which are due every April - will be wiped out by prices. Rising prices put huge pressure on the Chancellor to give these vital key workers pay rises above % or %, to avoid hitting them with a real-terms cut. But there are already clear signs the Treasury resisting such big cash rises. The government has spelt out plans to raise salaries for experienced teachers by only % in  . Health unions have also blasted plans to offer NHS staff in England a “miserly” % hike. . Rail fares Okay, we’re cheating here - this one has already come into effect. Rail passengers faced a ticket price nightmare as the steepest increases in almost a decade hit on March . According to industry body the Rail Delivery Group, people in England and Wales are set to shoulder the largest hike in rail ticket prices since January  with fares predicted to go up by .%. Labour has called the price hike brutal and campaign group Railfuture has accused Boris Johnsonaposs Government of “stoking the fire of the cost of living crisis” by enabling the increase.Ministers regulate rises in around half of fares including season tickets on most commuter routes.

The result reflects the world’s horror at the illegal actions of Vladimir Putin which has led to the slaughter of countless innocent lives.The words of condemnation must now be matched by a further tightening of the screw on Russian business and finance. The UK Government has acted swtly in cutting off banks and banning Russian planes from our airspace but has lagged behind the US and the EU in imposing other sanctions. Unlike Brussels we have still to freeze the assets of the members of the Russian Parliament. Dozens of Putin’s cronies and high-ranking military have yet to be targeted. The Tories have allowed London to become the world’s laundromat for Russian dirty money. They have also taken millions in donations from people with ties to the Kremlin. If they are serious about putting pressure on the Russian regime they should widen sanctions andthe donations. The longer they take to act, the more the suspicion grows that they are still in thrall to the oligarchs.  The best of us While Vladimir Putin has shown the worst of humanity with his brutal invasion, the public response to his vile actions has shown the best of humanity. Millions of people have donated to charities to help the people of Ukraine and the hundreds of thousands made homeless by the war. Some volunteers have even driven to the Polish-Ukrainian border to deliver much-needed medical supplies, food, clothes and toys for children. Their compassion has never been more necessary.

They have discovered the most effective way to deliver viruses into our homes is by infecting porn sites with them. A former cyber spy told the Sunday Mirror: “One click on an enticing video is enough to introduce malware into your computer or mobile. “The advice for safe cyber sex is the same as for real sex - use protection.”  That means always accepting updates when offered which install the latest security software on devices to ward off denial of service attacks. Our critical infrastructure and most big companies now have sufficient safety measures in place to foil even state sponsored cyber aggressors. But despite that the National Cyber Security Centre recorded  attempted breaches last year as Russia, China, North Korea and Iran tried to infiltrate four in ten British businesses. But it is small firms and iniduals without any sophisticated protection who are most at risk. The only sure way to stop the spread of viruses is to follow Covid rules - and self-isolate. Keep all sensitive information on a laptop not linked to the internet so viruses cannot destroy it. And then use a second machine to go about your day to day business. Russia has already done something similar on a larger scale, as its internet network can be disconnected from the rest of the worldneeded. They tested it in January in readiness for cyber war.

It was about as useful as holding it over your head when the four-minute warning sounded. The Army bod’s stark message was that the horrors of post-Armageddon existence would be far, far worse than sudden death. It says everything about the seriousness of preparations for survival that civic responsibility for liaising on who got to go in the bunker and trivial things like which civilians might be shot – ­looters first – was passed down to the youngest, most junior member of the local authority. We all knew: they wouldn’t, would they  Couldn’t, surely wouldn’t. Follow all of of todayaposs news on the war in Ukraine as it unfolds with our live blog  That was then, when the Cold War was beginning to heat up in an arms race, with US missiles piling up on British soil, pointing at Moscow. Here we are again. Households flocking to buy DIY nuclear bunkers. This time it’s Vlad the Invader threatening “consequences the like of which you have never seen in your history”the West so much as dips a wingtip across the border to alleviate the suffering and torment of the Ukrainian innocents. Nuclear war. World War Three. But he wouldn’t, would he  Only a madman would contemplate… President Vladimir Putin might only be pretending to be mad to frighten Boris Johnson and our military masters in Washington.As he hides under his bottle-strewn desk in Number , Boris will take small comfort from the fact that the suffering of Ukraine will at least deflect from his own demise. For now. Charles Powell, Tony Blair’s chief of staff, says that the deranged, megalomanic, brutal dictator had always been “rational” until now, echoing the diplomatic comfort blanket clutched by the West that the Russian leader had always been “pragmatic”.  No light burns as bright as hindsight. But this is the President who all the while presided over a string of naked violations of international law, from annexing Crimea to bombing civilians in Syria, while London became the laundromat for oligarchs’ dodgy cash. The judo black belt who claims ­martial arts saved him from a le of “hooliganism” on the streets had been plotting thuggery on an international scale. For him, the fall of the Berlin Wall was a “catastrophe” for Russia, to be reversed by redrawing the former USSR borders. Boris Johnson is “confident” Putin will fail in his conquest of Ukraine. That’s when it gets tricky. In his twisted logic, Putin believes a world without Russia is a world not worth preserving. Pariah status, crippling economic isolation and “failure” are seen as an existential threat that’ll make him desperate. A year ago, Putin lowered the bar on the use of nuclear weapons. Maybe his new best mate, Xi Jinping in China, will be able to persuade him that a new world order with half the planet missing isn’t a good idea. God help us all, as we pretend war planners used to say. It’s worked so far.

The great-gran scaled a ft-high indoor rock wall for the first time on her birthday. She was the first nonagenarian to don a harness at the Craggy Island Indoor Climbing Gym – and she loved every second. Marie, who is ft in, said: “It just felt so natural. I was cross I hadn’t done this before. “I just kept thinking, ‘I’m going to wake up soon, this is too much fun to be real!’ “It was something inside of me just waiting to come out. I’m just glad I’ve finally found out before I was too old.”Daughter Patricia, , said: “When Mum got down, there was this crowd standing around, unable to fully take in what they were seeing. “Mum was beaming and claimed she hadn’t heard the call to come down earlier because of her hearing aid – then did three more climbs!” Beth McFarlane, an instructor at the rock climbing centre in Guildford, said: “I wasn’t expecting Marie’s strength and speed.  She raced up the wall like someone half her age. It was staggering!” Former secretary Marie, from Old Coulsdon, Surrey, did a follow-up climb at Christmas and has booked to go climbing again for her th birthday.

For her th birthday, Marie enjoyed a games day which was attended by her five children,  grandchildren and  great-grandchildren.Patricia said: “Mum was firing guns, did archery, slack-lining, a coconut shy… she was the first in the Jacuzzi and we had a marquee representing Buckingham Palace, with a full-size Queen cutout. “Later, Mum steered a barge up and down the Thames while singing Land of Hope and Glory.“Mum’s always done things her way.

Lauren Monaghan, , crashed her  Vauxhall Adam Grfin into a parked vehicle in the early hours of the morning, just three doors from her home. Her motor, which sells for between £, and £,, stopped next to a tree. The honest estate agent then called the cops to admit she had crashed her car while being under the influence of alcohol.

Lauren lives with her parents in Aitken Crescent, Redding, Falkirk, and pleaded guilty to driving with excess alcohol. Solicitor Simon Hutchison, defending, said: Itaposs clear this was a really stupid one-off on her part. Sheaposs very, very upset and annoyed at her behaviour and she shows a great deal of remorse. It is her first offence, thereaposs nothing  outstanding, and Iaposm pretty sure weaposll never see her again in the criminal court.

A little-known Highway Code rule bans drivers from snoozing in their vehicle - with punishments ranging from a £, fine,  license points, or imprisonment. The rule - which is part of the road traffic act and the Highway Code - makes it illegal to be inside your car when drunk regardless of what youaposre doing. Evenyouaposre found fast asleep in the car, you could still be considered illegally in control of the vehicleyouaposre over the limit, My London reports.Sleeping in your car when youaposre drunk comes under the Road Traffic Act .  It says a motorist can be found guilty of the offencethey are in charge of a motor vehicle on a road or other public place after consuming so much alcohol that the proportion of it in his breath, blood or urine exceeds the prescribed limit. The rule is in place because there is no guarantee that a person will not try to drive when they wake up still under the influence - the law has to foresee that possibility. Depending on how much alcohol you have consumed you might need to consider spending the night at a hotel until you sober up. Other alternatives include getting a lt home from a friend or family member or trying to get a taxi.  The no-sleeping drunk rule comes under drink driving laws and a recent campaign has been set up to try and limit the damage that drunk driving is causing on our roads. It was made by THINK! and actively discourages the main group of drunk drivers, young men. Liz Brooker MBE, Chair of Road Safety Great Britain, told My London : “Road Safety Great Britain fully supports the THINK! Pint Block campaign. Someone who gets in their car after drinking is a risk to themselves, and all others on the road,including their friends.“This campaign highlights the role everyone has to play in reducing the number of people who drive, using the power of friendship to encourage safer driving and the need to protect those we care about.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AlcoholDangerous drivingCarsVehicles\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Roaring Girls, by Holly Kyte, retells the extraordinary lives of eight women who revolutionised the way we see women today.

Charlotte CharkeCharlotte was an th-century actress, theatre manager and cross-dresser, at a time when it was highly unusual for a woman to run a theatre.

Hannah Snell Hannah was an th-century performer who disguised herself as a man and became a soldier.

The district of Hodge Hill, four miles east of Birmingham city centre, is officially the country’s worst-hit area for fuel poverty. It is a place where schoolkids hand over lunchbox treats for poorer, hungrier children. And where even the homeless make contributions to foodbanks. The constituency is home to , people and nearly a third of families live in fuel poverty. It has one of the highest child poverty rates, with an astonishing % of youngsters – nearly , – living below the breadline. Unemployment is .% – one of the highest in the UK.Go behind the Government statistics, as the Sunday People did, and you find desperate families struggling to put food on the table amid a double whammy of fuel bills and price rises at the shops. Many pensioners choose between heating and eating and hordes of families visit foodbanks daily. They include nurses, who don’t earn enough to feed their families.Hodge Hill’s Labour MP Liam Byrne tells us: “It’s absolutely shameful. But it’s not unusual. The reality of Boris Johnson ’s Britain is that we have lockdown heroes who don’t earn enough to feed their families. It makes me absolutely enraged. And it’s always the people with nothing who give the most.“One homeless man came up to us at a foodbank collection asking what we were doing. When we told him, he handed over his own food.  “We literally have the homeless donating their food to us. That’s how desperate the situation is. “We’re in pretty much the poorest postcode in the country and the generosity is incredible. “You see children taking Penguin biscuits out of their lunchboxes to give to a foodbank, saying they didn’t want to see people going without. “We have people with nothing willing to help their neighbours, and a Prime Minister who parties on like there’s no tomorrow, oblivious to what’s going on in real lives.”  Mr Byrne spoke after we uncovered statistics revealing almost one in three hard-pressed people in the West Midlands has had to cut down on essential food items in the past three months. As the UK braces itself for a % energy price hike next month, new research from the Post Office and foodbank charity the Trussell Trust shows huge numbers are in crisis across Britain. Their surveys reveal % of Brits have had to make cutbacks to afford food and household bills. In the West Midlands % have less cash for food and half fear worse is to come. It’s not much better in London where % had to limit spending.What do you think  Have your say in our comments below... Figures from the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy show . million UK families were in fuel poverty in . Again, the West Midlands was worst hit, with , homes – or % – affected.At Aston and Nechells foodbank, where Suzi Lea is the co-ordinator, volunteers have seen the numbers of people coming through its doors increasing since the £ Universal Credit uplt was scrapped last year. Volunteer Keith Crawford , , and his husband Velta , , have had to rely on the foodbank themselves.Keith says: “That extra £ meant people had dignity. We treat animals better than people in this country. Week in, week out we are seeing broken people come through our doors.  “We see the whole cross-section of society. Since the uplt was removed, we have had starving people coming through the doors who we have had to offer a biscuit and a drink to. “It’s never been this bad. We had so many people through the doors one day over Christmas that we gave out  meals and stayed open longer. “One man who came in had to choose between eating and showering. How can people live in dignity and how can people go to job interviews in an area of already high unemployment when they can’t afford to shower  It becomes a vicious circle of poverty.”Family support worker Atia Parveen , who goes into the foodbank to offer debt advice, says people have become trapped by money problems.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  She adds: “Foodbanks are never intended as long-term solutions, so we’re here to help people budget. “But since Covid and now the cost-of-living crisis, we are seeing double trouble. “Helping people budget doesn’t get them out of crisis because they have nothing and prices continue to rise. We are trapped.”Care giver Marlene Taes , , collects food for the youngsters she supports. She says: “There are no opportunities for young people in the city. “We are seeing more and more vulnerable young people who don’t have jobs to go to, the ­training to support them or the services to help them get out of poverty so they can find work.”At Welcome Change Community Centre and Cafe, which helps vulnerable people and hosts lunch clubs throughout the week, we meet Lin Morris , . She is reliant on the centre and her grandchildren, who also provide her with food.Lin, who is registered disabled and is in assisted living, tells us: “I am one of the lucky ones, but without the extra support and help I get from my family I think I’d be dead within the year.” Married PatandTony Flynn , , fear the impact of “skyrocketing” prices on fuel and groceries.Their daughter’s food bill for her and her -year-old son has gone up from £ to £ a week. Of fuel, Pat, , says: “We are really worried because our pensions aren’t going to reflect the price hike. “It would mean us having to choose between heating or eating.”Full-time mum Jenner Gadson , , who has Ruby, eight, and Jack, four, has also seen her food shop more than double to over £. “There isn’t any extra support coming in from the Government to help,” she says. Childminder Karen Watson , , is struggling to meet weekly bills of more than £. She tells us: “All of the families I help are telling me worse and worse stories every week – and are even struggling to pay childminding fees.”Despite the bleak outlook, community spirit is, thankfully, alive and well in Hodge Hill. Pat Woolridge , , has been volunteering at the foodbank since it opened nine years ago.She says: “I am astonished by how much worse it has got over the pandemic. We have seen homelessness go up in the last few months too.” But amid a pile of donations, Pat packages toys, gts and books donated for local children. It brings a smile to her face. And she adds, with stoicism typical of Hodge Hill folk: “We’re really lucky to live here.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Trussell TrustEconomic crisisFuel povertyPrice risesUnemploymentBritish economyHomelessnessPoliticsSunday MirrorSunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ahead of this year’s International Women’s Day on Tuesday, we’ve asked some of the UK’s most inspirational women what being female means to them – and why women are still being held back today. STEF REID, PARALYMPIAN My mum Carol was always ahead of her time. I will never forget, we were away on a weekend with my dad and his friends. The men were playing a golf competition to see who could get closest to the hole. They all took a shot, they were about to see who the winner was, when my mum said, ‘Hang on, I want a go.’ She took a shot and won. It proves gender doesn’t matter. I can go out and compete with men, it’s not a barrier.  It’s happened a few times when I’ve felt like people were more interested in working with a male. It makes you feel small and want to shrink. My biggest female inspiration is Chantal Petitclerc – she is widely regarded as the best wheelchair racer of all time. She told me there is no one path to excellence. You have to forge your own path and be brave enough to do that.  GLORIA HUNNIFORD, TV PRESENTER WHO IS TEAMING UP WITH FELLOW ITV HOSTS TO PROMOTE INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY An elderly woman in Dublin stopped me last year and whispered, ‘I love that Loose Women... you talk about sex and we were never allowed to!’ These days, we can discuss any subject – and that’s a big change. I grew up in a conservative house in Ireland watching my mother desperate to do something, but Dad wouldn’t allow her to have a job. It was dferent for me. I liked the independence that work gave me. I thought I was going to be a singer until I met a forward-thinking BBC producer who convinced me otherwise.It was  and the start of the troubles in Northern Ireland. He said, ‘Remember, as a woman you’re not coming here to do knitting and sewing and recipes. You will be as good as ANY man reporting on bombs, bullets and barricades just like them.’ He was the key to making me feel like I could do this job.  JESS PHILLIPS, LABOUR MP AND SHADOW MINISTER FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SAFEGUARDINGThe women of the  general election changed my le. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for them – they knew young mums needed support with childcare. They built a ladder for women like me. My mum was like Erin Brockovich.She was a freedom fighter. She sued the biggest pharmaceutical company in the country because they blinded my nan. She still inspires me every day. Women face many of the same challenges in  that they did in . They are still lower paid, they are still not safe in their homes, in their workplaces and on the streets.  On International Women’s Day, I want women to know they should never be grateful for progress made – they should always be desperate for more. KATIE PIPER, ACTIVIST The survivors and volunteers I have met through my charity, The Katie Piper Foundation, are the women who have taught me I can do anything. I have felt discriminated against – not only because I’m female, but because my appearance isn’t society’s ‘norm’.  Gender-based discrimination happens every single day, in so many dferent circumstances. Conversation helps and we need to keep having open, honest conversations. My mum Diane is my biggest female inspiration – she is the definition of a strong, resilient woman. I’ll teach both of my girls that the world is their oyster, and I’ll do what I can to make that path easy for them – as a mother and as a woman. ANGELA RAYNER, DEPUTY LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY Women are just brilliant, aren’t they  I am incredibly lucky to be surrounded by a huge iety of wonderful women in every part of my le. It is because of the encouragement of the women I worked with that I became their Trade Union rep. And it was a woman, my mum in the movement, Sue Forster, that dragged me into becoming so involved with UNISON and ultimately becoming an MP.My best friends from school, the women that I caused mischief with as a teenager are still some of my best friends today. They supported me through a teen pregnancy when none of us had any money and absolutely no clue.My women MP friends are brilliant and I am proud to be able to navigate the weird world of Westminster alongside them. We celebrate each other’s successes and we protect each other when it gets rough.What do you think  Have your say in our comments below... When I was younger, I donapost think I never saw feminism as something for me. I was a social carer raising a tiny child on my own, feminists were white middle-class women asking for a place at the boardroom table. But I learnt that wasn’t the case. Feminism is creating the space for each of us to authentically be ourselves, without fear of discrimination or harm. Feminism has plenty of space for gobby northern gingers. I am only where I am because of the love, encouragement and kindness I was shown by women for many years.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. International Women’s Day is a moment for us to celebrate what it means to be ourselves and commit for another year to be there for each other. If you do nothing  this International Women’s Day, please join me in sending a postcard, a note or a text to woman you think is wonderful and telling them why - it might just be the little boost they need. JESSICA-JANE APPLEGATE, PARALYMPIC SWIMMER AND MENCAP AMBASSADOR I come from a single-parent family and my mum has been the biggest influence in my le, she has taught me so much. My auntie also taught me cheeky, naughty things when I was younger but that was to wind my mum up! My nanny also used to take me out into the garden and teach me about flowers and butterflies. I struggle with my mental health and I love being in nature - I find it helps. My learning disability affects me daily in everything from my organisation skills, reading and writing abilities to my training at the pool. I rely on the support around me for so much and my coach Alex is amazing. Before a race, she used to make me flip charts of small pictures to take with me to keep me calm.  For many years I havenapost been able to compete at the Commonwealth Games, not because Iaposm not fast enough or because my classication wasnapost included - but because men were included but women were not. This made me angry to start with and I had to watch my teammates get all their lovely kit and go off to competitions I wasn’t allowed at. In the end I had an opportunity with Mencap to raise the issue in Parliament. Never did I think the rules would change in my career, but only two weeks ago I raced in Aberdeen and got the qualying time. International Womenaposs Day is important to me because I try to campaign for inclusion for everyone and women in sport is really important, so this day is the day we can celebrate and promote all the fantastic female role models out there as well as share stories of inspiration. I would say to young girls who have a learning disability: you can achieve anything, anything is possible! DR SAGIDA BIBI, SENIOR POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCHERAT THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD AND MEMBER OF THE OXFORD VACCINE GROUP I am first generation born in the UK after my parents arrived here from Pakistan. Education in Pakistani communities across the UK was not seen as a priority for girls at the time. I didn’t know any Muslim or Pakistani female that had gone to university or into science. There are still many girls that don’t have strong female role models in their families and communities but that should not deter them.  When I looked around when I was younger it seemed like success and careers weren’t for people like me. You never felt quite good enough and this is reinforced through dficult experiences like racism and prejudice that you face growing up. I don’t think I ever thought I would be going to university because the concept was never instilled either at home or school. If you keep striving for the next step evenyou don’t have your whole future mapped out, then you quickly realise that you are on an uncharted but exciting path. I didn’t get my PhD until I was  – but I didn’t give up. Even when people told me I wouldn’t make it – that it was too late, too dficult or my grades weren’t good enough. It’s important that you remember your strengths not your weaknesses and don’t let anybody ’s expectations for you define your future path. It is important to recognise that barriers for people of colour – let alone women – in educational and employment workplaces still exist and we are still striving for better representation in the scientic fields. I am part of a fantastic group and a scientist that helped develop the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine and still get amazed that the girl at school who wasn’t even sure she should do A-levels made it this far. I get to work alongside some of the greatest researchers in the world and help some of the poorest to get the vaccines that they should – and that’s a privilege that I never take for granted. My message to all girls and women out there that might just be thinking they are not good enough – you are more than good enough and will excelyou just keep moving forward towards your goals. SAS GRANVILLE, FOOTBALL COACH AND MENCAP AMBASSADOR  Growing up I was always taught the importance of being respectful and caring of everyone. I have cerebral palsy and a learning disability and so have to adapt many of the things I do that most people consider to be ‘normal’ or ‘day to day’. I have been very lucky to have some great female role models around me both in my immediate family and some of the kind people who have supported me. My older sister, Roxy, has taught me some invaluable le lessons. Most notably, the importance of taking time to appreciate yourself for who you really are, and to embrace being dferent. My mum has also helped me to grow into a confident and independent young woman. Without her support and encouragement, I would not be where I am today. I work hard to make sure my disability doesn’t limit me and view it as a part of my le that I live with. I really appreciate it when people acknowledge and consider this and ask how they can help, rather than making assumptions or sometimes not seeing and noticing. From a young age, I always looked up to my grandma who taught me some of the most important le skills. She was a kind, patient and lovable person who always had time for everyone. International Women’s Day is a great opportunity to highlight fantastic achievements and the importance of dference. I would say never give up on your dreams and don’t let anyone bring you down. Keep doing what makes you happy and build strong relationships with female role models around you. But most of all, don’t let anyone ever tell you that you can’t do something because of your disability or your gender. DR MAHESHI RAMASAMY, SENIOR CLINICAL RESEARCHER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD AND MEMBER OF THE OXFORD VACCINE GROUP It is a really extraordinary time for women in science. In many ways the pandemic has impacted adversely on women in terms of increases in domestic violence, women seeing their careers impacted and women having to bear the brunt of childcare.  But I am grateful that women’s roles in healthcare and science have been highlighted and celebrated. When I started out as a junior doctor  years ago, there were very few female consultants and female role models. It’s been incredible to see how much the situation has changed. There has been a real sht in the numbers of women in my specialty, but we still have a long way to go when we look at senior management. I hope in ten years’ time it will change again.  I am very lucky to come from a family that celebrates female education and where working women have been the norm. My great-grandmother was a real trailblazer of her time - she was the first woman to be a school principal in Sri Lanka. And my mother was a scientist. That’s quite unusual in an Asian background like mine. It has never occurred to me to not pursue the career I wanted because I have been surrounded by these amazing women who have always done what they wanted to do. And there are so many women we can look up to now who are reaching those peaks - Baroness Hale was incredible as President of the Supreme Court. For a woman of her generation to have got to her level is an extraordinary achievement. And to see a woman of colour like Kamala Harris become US Vice President is pretty remarkable. I hope we can reach the stage where we can talk about them not because they are women, but just because they are amazing people. I am glad International Women’s Day exists - but it’s a shame we need to have an International Women’s Day at all.Sas and Jessica-Jane are Myth Busters for the learning disability charity Mencap.

However, Ms Phillips, , from Thames Ditton, Surrey, had not booked any undertakers as her -year-old father Brianaposs death was classied as aposunexpectedapos by paramedics. This meant he had to be collected by a dferent funeral director, which was acting on behalf of the coroner. Floyd and Son Funeral Directors, which was contracted by the coroner to transport the body, said the care home should have told Ms Phillips where her dadaposs body was being taken. However, she was forced to track down Brianaposs body alone after Albany Park Nursing Home, in Enfield, London, gave her the name of the undertakers and nothing . Ms Phillips said: “The care home assumed he had been handed to my undertakers. “I said ‘no he hasn’t, my undertaker is not allowed to take him until the coroner has seen the body’. I asked themthey’d handed his body to any old undertaker.Have you had a similar experience  Email webnews@mirror to tell your story “They gave me the name of the funeral directors and I had to look up their number – I remember Googling it.“For three days I was searching for my dad, I was so shocked about what was going on grief didn’t really come into it. “I was thinking ‘where is he ’ My brother joked saying maybe it wasn’t him, maybe he had gone into another room in the care home because he couldn’t get the football on the telly.” The siblings even joked that the wrong body might turn up at the funeral like in the opening scene of the  film Death at a Funeral. Ms Phillips said: “The care home had no idea where he was. I was flabbergasted and angry. The only thing they knew was the name of the undertakers who collected dad. “I would expect a care home to know what mortuary he had been taken to and who the undertakers were. I got the impression they didn’t after they said my undertakers had collected him. “I don’t think they passed over any of my contact details. The coroner said they had no contact details for me.”  After the care home gave her the name of the coroneraposs undertakers, Floyd and Son Funeral Directors, she rang them and found out her dad’s body had been taken to Haringey Mortuary. Her fruit and veg trader father died of suspected Covid on January  last year but it was not until January  that she was able to get through to the mortuary and confirm his body was there. She added: “I had to ring up the mortuary because I needed to know - because of what had gone on before – that he was there. I wanted to make sure, you stop trusting what you hear. “My dad died on the Saturday and I got through to the mortuary on the Monday. “They confirmed they had his body and said I needed to contact the coroner’s office to make an appointment .“I sent them an email and a woman rang me on Tuesday saying she was so glad I contacted her because they had no contact details for me.” Discussing Brianaposs death, Ms Phillips revealed that paramedics attempted to resuscitate him even though he previously had a ‘do not resuscitate’ order in hospital. The order was not transferred to Albany Park when he was discharged from hospital just over two weeks before his death. After the resuscitation efforts failed, the ambulance crew called the police as Brianaposs death was unexpected and therefore needed to be investigated. The police deemed it was not suspicious and rang the coroner service, who in turn organised for Floyd and Son Funeral Directors to collect Brian’s body, Ms Phillips said. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter She is only speaking out now because she does not want another person to go through the same ordeal as her. “Part of me feels guilty about complaining. I know it was a terrible December and January with the second wave, I know how hard everyone was working and how stressed people were,” she said. “ButI don’t say something it’s going to happen again.” Ms Phillips emphasised that she has no issue with Floyd and Son Funeral Directors as they were helpful in her time of need. Dean Floyd, of Floyd and Son Funeral Directors, said: When we arrive at the care home, we introduce ourselves as Floyd and Son, we advise the manager that we are here to collectand they take our details down.We advise them we are taking the deceased to wherever has been requested by the coroner. In this instance Haringey Public Mortuary. The care home should have a duty of care to relay that information to the next of kin. Floyd and Son would not have knowledge of this information. The care home should have given the mortuary number - we never bring a deceased back to Floyd’s. What’s appalling is the number is not manned over the weekend, where our number is, so any of my staff would have been able to advise where Mr Phillips was, but they would not have been able to speak to the Coroner’s office or Mortuary until Monday morning. At the very least the care home should have said Floyd and Son collected the late Brian Phillips, and given them our telephone number and we could have advised the next of kin. Enfield Council launched a safeguarding probe into the case and concluded that in the future the care home should ensure families receive the correct information about undertakers. The council, which does not run the care home, declined to comment when approached by The Mirror. Albany Park Nursing Home was approached for comment.

Our heartwarming photo shows a beaming Denise Fergus cradling tiny Peyton, who has turned her le around. Denise sees tiny flashes of James in the tot, who is now  months old. And when the toddler visits, she is always drawn to the picture of a smiling boy on the mantelpiece. The little boy she sits and stares at is two-year-old James, who was tragically abducted and ­murdered  years ago by two evil killers, both aged .In an exclusive interview, Denise told the Sunday People how her granddaughter has “helped remind her of the happiness in the world”. She said: “Peyton has been a power of strength for us and helped the light come back into our lives after James. “Her dad Michael looks so much like James and I can see him in Peyton, too. It’s lovely.” Denise will tell Peyton about her uncle James one day but said her granddaughter “is a reminder to try to focus on the happiness in our lives, not the tragedy”. She added: “There is not a day I don’t think of James and now having Peyton in our lives gives me even more strength to fight in his name.” And Denise needed all that strength last month when it was revealed Jon Venables, , one of James’ killers, is bidding for parole. He will appear at a hearing later this year. She said: “I’m living an amazing le and most the time I’m flying with ­happiness but when this comes up it drags me back down again. “It just ­deflates me, it’s just so hard. It’s been never-ending. “But I will fight with everything I possibly can to keep him in prison. It is a le battle. I’ve done it from the ­beginning and I’ll do it until the end.”  Denise, , who has three other sons – Thomas, Leon and Michael – will ­never accept an ­apology from Venables, or speak to him, saying: “I don’t believe he’ll ever be sorry. He should never be allowed back on the streets.” She and husband Stuart are also battling to keep the James Bulger Memorial Trust alive after fundraising was blighted by Covid and they received no Government help. The charity foundation helps young people affected by a crime or bereavement by ­offering them stays at a ­holiday lodge. James’ brutal torture and murder in  at the hands of Venables and Robert Thompson shocked the nation. The twisted pair snatched James from Denise as she was out shopping in Bootle, Merseyside. They were jailed but also given lelong anonymity and new ­identities following their release. Venables was first released in  but then recalled in  and  for possession of child abuse images. Thompson, also , is now free and is living under a new identity. Denise said: “What happened to James is something I think about every day. It has got easier over time but especially when something comes up like it just has, it comes back. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to sht that off. “I’m hoping and praying he doesn’t get ­released because he’s still capable of evil. He’s proven to everyone that he’s still got it and that’s why he’s locked up again.  “I thinkhe comes out he will do something ­because he’s so used to ­being looked after now. He’s a danger to society. I don’t want another family to go through what my family has been through – you’re on a rollercoaster ride from the beginning. He knows where I live, he knows what I look like. I’m not getting told where he lives and I don’t know what he looks like. “Now the lads are older and we’ve got the new baby I’m going to be ­worried. I don’t knowhe’s going to be standing outside my house while we’re all sleeping. “I’m hoping to God he doesn’t find out where Michael lives.” Denise was told by her lawyer that Venables had askedhe could speak to her and say sorry. She said: “I wouldn’t accept his apology. What would he expect me to say. It’s OK  When you murdered my boy in the worst possible way  You can apologise over saying something wrong, but not taking someone’s le.” She also hit out at the criminal justice system, saying: “How much money has he had spent on him  “New identity, new le, protection, yet we live on the edge of our seat. They always look after the one who taken someone’s le and not the victims. It’s wrong on every level, the law should be changed on that.” Denise and Stuart have taken solace in their family. Thomas, Leon and Michael lived at home with her until recently. In November , Michael and partner Leanne had Peyton, Denise’s first grandchild.Denise said: “She’s an absolute doll. She’s such a good baby, she hardly ever cries, she’s walking everywhere, she’s just a joy. She’s at that stage whereyou give her a chocolate bar it doesn’t stay in her hand, it’s all over your furniture.” Leanne thinks Peyton looks a lot like Denise but the new gran said: “We can see Michael more in her. It’s more her eyes than anything. Of course, you have moments when you remember James at that age. “Having our family has helped so much. You could be having a down day but then the front door opens and in they come, that gives you the lt then, it changes your mood and changes the day for you. “It’s just lovely to have them around and we’re always there for them as well. “The years have gone so quick it’s just unbelievable. You see them as babies but now they’re grown men and we’re ­grandparents now.” Last month, the family went to James’ grave, which they call his “resting place”, to mark the th anniversary of his death. But Denise said Peyton’s presence the past two years has altered the ­atmosphere around the date for the family. She said: “She changed the mood on James’ anniversary last year and this. We talk amongst ourselves and we talk about James, but when Peyton came along – it’s still about James – but Peyton takes our attention. Although there’s the grim side, we still give our time to Peyton. She takes me back to when we had James and our lads. We’ve got this new baby in our lives and we absolutely adore and treasure her.”  Michael said: “When it was the anniversary of James in February they came to ours. You could see the smile on the face from Denise having the baby there. It just took her mind off what the day should have been, this little bundle. It was really nice to see.” The family have cleaned the ground at James’ resting place, laid new grass and got a new wrought-iron frame made. Denise said: “Michael brings Peyton to James’ resting place and it’s nice he makes her a part of it. At Christmas Eve we go and put up a Christmas tree for James. We always have a star that goes on top of the tree at Christmas Eve and that’s always been Michael’s job. Maybe it’s something he and Peyton can do ­together this year.” They also have a quiet place in honour of James behind their home in Merseyside – James’ Garden. Denise said: “Because James isn’t here to spend the money on, we put the money into our own ­private little garden. “We’ve got a fish pond out there we’ve got a ­waterfall fountain thing with Christmas lights. “It’s a constant reminder of him for us.” Later this month, Denise and Stuart are hosting the Black Tie and Tiara Ball for the James Bulger Memorial Trust. Denise said: “It’s so good to be fundraising again in James’ name and for his trust. Lockdown made it really dficult and we seriously had to consider whether to close the trust, such was the upkeep of the lodge and other things. “We also had to cancel on the eve of a big charity ball which would’ve marked James’ th birthday because of Covid. “Since then we’ve struggled – we’re not the only ones. But now we’re back. We have got a good line-up – Claire Sweeney and a Jersey Boys tribute act. It will be a great night.” Denise added: “Sometimes I feel like throwing my cards down and saying I’ve had enough. But then I speak to Stuart and the lads, and look at Peyton. “And I did make that promise to James and I will stand by it. I’ll always keep ­going for him.”The Black Tie and Tiara Ball in aid of the James Bulger Memorial Trust is on Saturday, March , at the Crowne Plaza, Liverpool.

The fact The Queen appointed Harry as her Commonwealth Youth ambassador and that bride-to-be Meghan accompanied him to the  Commonwealth Youth Summit was proof of the confidence which she had in them both. A month later, as Meghan walked down the aisle her ft veil included hand-stitched detail depicting the flowers of every Commonwealth nation in homage to The Queenaposs Coronation gown.  Meghanaposs mother, Doria Ragland, had flown from Calornia and was the only member of her family present. Thomas did not attend saying he wanted to spare the couple any embarrassment after an incident which saw him pose for paparazzi pictures as he prepared for the big day. It was unclear why Michael, a US air force veteran and diplomat who had once secured her an internship at the US embassy in Argentina, was not invited.  But, Mr Hardman adds, the dynamics of her family certainly eclipsed the usual criticisms about the Royal Family being dysal.The book also reveals The Queen knew the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would notto royal le as soon as she learned they had left with their dogs in tow. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stunned the world when they quit their royal duties in , revealing they were starting a new le overseas.Some around the corridors of Buckingham Palace expected them to one dayto the fold, but the -year-old monarch knew dferently. She told a visitor she did not expect them to resume royal le. When asked about a futurefor the couple, she replied: “Of course not. They took the dogs.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CommonwealthBuckingham PalacePrince HarryThe QueenMeghan MarklePrince Charles, Prince of WalesMarriageRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They took the dogs.”  Meghan loves animals and was heartbroken when she had to leave her Labrador-Shepherd mix dog Bogart behind when she moved to the UK, because of his age.Sources suggested Bogart did not join them in their new Los Angeles home as he “ did not get on with Harry ”.The Sussexes currently have two dogs- a beagle named Guy and a black Labrador called Pula - who Meghan used to dress in Union Flag colours. Pula is the currency of Botswana, the African country which became a “refuge” for the prince following the death of Princess Diana.  Botswana is also where the couple spent five nights camping together when they were first dating. Meghan, a promoter of adopting rescue dogs, chose animal welfare charity Mayhew as one of her first patronages. She has previously said the pair of rescue dogs mean the absolute world to her and has referred to them as my loves and my boys. Chat show host Ellen DeGeneres first convinced Meghan to adopt Bogart when she bumped into her in a shelter. Prince Harry’s love of dogs runs in the family, with his grandmother best known for her love of corgis.  Harry revealed in  the corgis took to his then new partner “straight away”. He said: “Iaposve spent the last  years being barked at this one walks in, absolutely nothing.” The Queen has owned more than  corgis, many of them direct descendants of her first one, Susan - given to her as an th birthday present by her parents in . Susan was so loved that she accompanied the then Princess Elizabeth on her honeymoon.

I didnapost go to the gym for years and years and years.” And her gym routine will also leave people shocked, as the nonagenarian works out for at least an hour and a half, maybe a little more.

The new rules and regulations being brought in at the beginning of April cover areas such as orce proceedings, paying taxes and receiving money from the Government. Some of them only businesses but several could affect ordinary people, too. WalesOnline reports on some of the key measures which people may not be aware of.VED rates are going up meaning a rise in car tax from April  From April , Vehicle Excise Dutywill rise in line with the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation from April . But how much the cost will rise by will depend upon your vehicles emissions. For instance,your car emits no CO, your car tax will remain at . If your caraposs CO emissions are between  and g per km, your standard rate of car tax will increase from £ to £, but your first year rate will still be £.  The amount you pay also depends on how often you want to make a payment. There’s a five per cent surchargeyou pay monthly or every six months. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agencyruns computer tests every month to check whether the owners of cars registered in the UK have paid tax. If the system flags up an untaxed vehicle that is not declared SORN , the DVLA will send a fine of £ to the owner. If this is paid within  days, a  per cent discount should be applied. New orce laws will come into force from  April  On  April this year changes to the legislation on orce will come into force. The changes are part of the Divorce, Dissolution and Separation Act , which aims to reduce the potential for conflict amongst orcing couples by:removing the ability to make allegations about the conduct of a spouse allowing couples to end their marriage jointlyThe act also introduces a minimum period of  weeks between the start of proceedings and application for conditional order.  This provides couples with a meaningful period of reflection and the chance to reconsider. Where orce is inevitable, it enables couples to cooperate and plan for the future. It will also no longer be possible to contest a orce, except on limited grounds including jurisdiction.It is worth noting that, as the new changes are brought in, the current online service will be unavailable from  March . You can find out more about this on the governmentaposs website.HMRC will stop making payments to Post Office card accounts after  April  About , customers still need to switch so they don’t miss out on vital payments as HMRC will stop making payments to Post Office card accounts after  April . This means customers must noty HMRC of their new account details. Customers can choose to receive their benefit payments to a bank, building society or credit union account. If they already have an alternative account, they can contact HMRC now to update their details.If a customer misses the  April deadline, their payments will be paused until the customer noties HMRC of their new account details.Customers can also use The Money Helper website, which offers information and advice about how to choose the right current account and how to open an account.Employers will have to increase wages paid to some workers Changes in the minimum wage are in the pipeline. The Low Pay Commission made recommendations to the UK Government on what the minimum wage and living wage should be for . The UK Government accepted those recommendations and from April , , it will be law for employers to pay their staff no less than the new rates. New living wage and minimum wage rates from April  can be found on gov.uk. New tax for plastic packaging A new plastic packaging tax is coming into force in April  that will apply to all plastic packaging manufactured in the UK, or imported into the UK, that does not contain at least % recycled plastic. The government has defined plastic packaging as “packaging that is predominantly plastic by weight” and the new tax will not apply to any plastic packaging which containing at least  per cent recycled plastic or any packaging.  Imported plastic packaging will be liable to the tax whether the packaging is unfilled or filled. The Government says the new tax aims to “provide a clear economic incentive for businesses to use recycled plastic in the manufacture of plastic packaging” and should lead to increased levels of recycling and collection of plastic waste, saving much of it from going to landfill. The new law will take effect from April . Accountancy firm Harold Duckworth reports the rate of tax will be £ per metric tonne of plastic packaging. Changes in corporation tax Companies and unincorporated associations that pay corporation tax will be affected by changes which come into effect on April , . HM Revenue and Customs has set the “main rate” for corporation tax for all non-ring-fenced profits to  per cent for the financial year that begins on April , , increasing to  per cent of profits over £, from April , . A small profits ratewill also be introduced at this time for companies with profits of £, or less so that they will continue to pay corporation tax at  per cent. Households urged to get ready for £ council tax rebateHouseholds across England are being urged to set up direct debits with their local council to receive a council tax rebate that will help millions of families manage costs of living.People who pay council tax by direct debit will see the cash go directly into their bank accounts from April. Those who do not pay by direct debit will be contacted by their council and invited to make a claim. Around  million households in council tax bands A to D - including  per cent of rented properties - are set to benefit from the £ billion council tax rebate, which does not have to be repaid.  It is part of a package of government measures to help families with rising energy costs. An extra £ million will also be given to councils to provide discretionary support to vulnerable households who may not qualy for the £ council tax rebate. This includes people on low incomes in council tax bands E to H.According to the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Rt Hon Michael Gove : As we emerge from the pandemic, we understand the pressures facing many families as global inflation levels increase.The support we have introduced will help millions of people, particularly those on the lowest incomes and the most vulnerable. We continue to stand behind the British people and I urge everyone who is eligible to claim this rebate to do so. Changes to fuel Red diesel and rebated biofuels will become illegal from April , which will mainly affect users of off-road vehicles such as bulldozers and cranes. The change is being made to help the UK meet its  climate commitments.

Putin raised the awful spectre of nuclear confrontation because he’s losing, or at least not winning as easily as he expected. His calamitous miscalculation in invading Ukraine is backfiring badly now, and the world is uniting against him. He faces a battle at home too, as anti-war protests swell in Moscow and other cities. The pressure on Putin must be intensied, never relaxed, until he has withdrawn the last of his forces from the country he attacked.  And then he must face judgement. He must be held to account for an unforgivable assault that will cost many lives on both sides, including civilians. Many more are being forced to flee their homes in terror. Britain has sent military equipment and is picking up speed on sanctions but much more can be done to help Ukraine. Oligarchs close to Putin must be pursued relentlessly. And we should take in our share of Ukrainian refugees.  Plane  simple Lting remaining Covid travel restrictions, particularly the bureaucratic passenger locator forms, could ease flying without endangering public health. The evidence proving they helped reduce virus infections is almost non-existent. On the other hand, dropping a demand that the unvaccinated entering Britain take a test to prove they’re Covid-free is arguably more controversial. We deserve to see the science guiding Government decisions, because a resurgence of the virus would be terrible.

Her Majesty, who usually resides in London, has been working from home at Windsor Castle for the last two years since the pandemic began.And now with more health concerns having recently caught Covid- and suffering from more mobility issues, the -year-old is said to have decided to make Windsor her official residence.Buckingham Palace, which has been the official royal residence since , is currently undergoing a £million refurbishment which is due to be completed in .  When the renovations began, it was planned that the Queen would only moved out of her private apartments temporarily. But since then, it has been decided that she will vacate the Palace for good to minimise her travel, with it also no longer deemed suitable for a long-term home, The Times reports. Itaposs understood the Queen will also permanently work from home at Windsor Castle. The record-breaking monarch will celebrate her th birthday this year, and was reported to have said that she “couldn’t move” as she leaned on her walking stick at a meeting at the Castle last month. Last October, the Queen was advised to rest for several weeks on doctor’s orders, after going for tests at hospital for an unspecied illness. She also tested positive for Covid- last month, experiencing “light symptoms” while she continued to carry out “light duties”. The Queen spent much of lockdown at Windsor with Prince Philip until his death in April last year. It is expected that Her Majesty willand “be visible” at Buckingham Palace for festivities such as the Platinum Jubilee celebrations this year.For her birthday on June , she will still appear in the balcony of the central London residence. And the Union Jack, which flies to signy the monarch is not at the Palace, will now remain permanently, disappointing any tourists hoping to catch a glimpse of her while visiting London. During the pandemic, the Queen did not switch her residence seasonally as normal, where she typically ummer with family at Balmoral in Aberdeenshire and takes up residence at her Norfolk estate, Sandringham, from December until mid-February. Her next event outside Windsor Castle is the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on, this month on March .

Tweeting about her shock, she said: “I am shocked to find out that the oranges I was trying to buy all day are not vegan. Pfft.” She had been searching for the Tesco Finest Emperor Oranges  Pack, but couldnapost buy them due to her choice of diet. Non-vegan fruits were also found in Marks and Spencer and Morrisons. The fruits themselves are of course vegan, but they are classed as unsuitable due to the chemicals sprayed on them as they grow. Farmers often use pesticides to make the fruit look better, and grow larger. Imazalil - banned in all but tiny amounts - is the common non-vegan item used by growers on their fruit and veg.  The E version of the chemical, as it will be shown on any label, is a wax made of shellac. There are also other versions of the same wax which are made up of beeswax to give fruits such as oranges a shine. Vegans don’t eat shellac or beeswax as they come from animals and therefore aren’t part of a plant-based diet. The added chemical also drew attention to the hazardous pesticide Propiconazole, banned apart from tiny amounts by the EU as it is hazardous to health. Now that the UK has left Europe, Propiconazole is no longer regulated as harshly and is being used as a pesticide on fruit and veg. It is known to have cancer increasing qualities. There was widespread criticism of the use of pesticides, especially the two listed above. One social media commenter said: “Propiconazole banned by the EU because of risks to fertility and to the health of the unborn child. Propiconazole is now on fruit in the UK. Important work done by the EU in assessing safety of chemicals - now ditched by Govt.” Another said: “When fruit isnapost suitable for Vegans you know something bad is happening.” With one explaining: “Imazalil  propiconazole are fungicides  are the reason why we shouldaposve been scrubbing citrus fruits before using the peel  washing hands after peeling  before eating treated fruit. Better to buy organic, untreated fruits when available.”Tesco told MyLondon that all their oranges are suitable for vegans but some oranges are labelled ‘non-vegan’ due to the wax applied post-harvest which contains shellac which helps keep fruit fresh.They said it is a common treatment for conventional citrus packing in the industry. They are also working with growers to develop a vegan-friendly alternative.

Michelle Edwards, , claims the council even offered to provide a van to help her with the move, although she says this never happened.She has lived in her London flat for more than  years and says she hasnapost been able to stop crying since she was handed the unexpected notice last week, reports MyLondon. I’m incredibly stressed out, I can’t even quanty the level of stress and anxiety, and it’s just been relentless, she said. I’ve been crying non-stop, my sleeping has been affected, it’s the first thing that’s on my mind when I’m drting off to sleep, it’s the first thing on my mind when I wake up.”  Although Michelle says sheaposs happy to move into a new flat, she claims she should have been given adequate time, information and resources to make the move. She believes the way Waltham Forest Council has treated her has even bordered on harassment, claiming they have been calling her repeatedly throughout the days encouraging her to move. Michelle was left infuriated further when she claims she discovered friends on the estate knew more about the situation than she did. There had been talks of a regeneration project in the area for a number of years after the council found the flats were “unfit for purpose”.Michelle claims the council had plans to move her into a new property since before , but complications brought about by the pandemic and Brexit meant it was delayed.“We received one eviction notice, and nothing happened. It fell through,” Michelle explained. “Then we received another eviction notice in  and a letter last year saying we would be moved out in November .” Michelle began to pack up a letime of possessions, but claims she was never provided with a specic move-out date from the council. A neighbour told her she had heard sheaposd be moving in January  rather than November, and she started to put things in place for the new move-out date. But Michelle claims the date was changed multiple times, leading to increased uncertainty and worry about when she would be placed in her new flat. “I’ve had ious dferent health complications over the years,” Michelle said. “I dislocated my left arm, I detached my left foot from my leg [...] I’ve got metal plates and rods holding everything together. That’s always given me problems. Walking is quite problematic, and then I have backache from where I’m not walking properly and have chronic pain.” Michelle also underwent treatment for fibroids, which meant roughly three quarters of her stomach was surgically removed and she is still dealing with the effects of this treatment. On the late afternoon of Thursday, February , Michelle received an email from the council. She claims she was invited to move into her new property on Monday, February , when her new tenancy would begin. This would give her only three full days to pack up her flat, view the new property, agree to the move and arrange logistical arrangements.  Michelle claims this situation has left her “essentially homeless”. She added: “To drop an email late Thursday, start my tenancy on Monday - and then you tell me I’m liable for rent on a property I haven’t even seen  How am I supposed to move  years’ worth of possessions and move into a new property, that I wouldn’t have even had the keys for, andit by the Sunday  Nothing makes sense.” Waltham Forest councillor Simon Miller, cabinet member for economic growth, said: “The regeneration of the Marlowe Road estate has been ongoing since , and residents have been kept informed at all times. “The project will deliver  much-needed high-quality new homes, including  for council rent and a further  for shared ownership, and an on-site energy centre alongside a new plaza, children’s play area, and commercial outlets. In a consultation held prior to the regeneration commencing,  per cent of residents indicated that they were in favour of the area’s redevelopment and we are working with tenants to ensure all moves into their new homes go smoothly. “We invite any residents who feel they do not have the adequate support they need to contact us so we can work together constructively to find a solution.”Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DisabilityHousingWaltham Forest Council\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

At apos, Julia is only slightly taller than apos Kylie, and youaposd be forgiven for thinking you were looking at the real deal.Although sheaposs yet to match Kylieaposs  million Instagram followers, Julia has carved out a signicant social media presence, boasting , followers on Instagram where she goes by the username @juju.brazil. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Julia receives many messages from people calling her the Brazilian Kylie Jenner, but finds that attention ies depending on whether sheaposs in the UK or Brazil. The cam model said: “I think itaposs funny because a lot of people around here [London] think I look like her. It was only since I moved to the UK four years ago that I started to get told it. I think in Brazil thereaposs a similar kind of look, so people donapost point it out. However, being Kylieaposs doppelganger certainly has its disadvantages, with Julia having previously been told that her looks can be intimidating.She explained: People tell me Iaposm intimidating to approach. Probably because I have a resting b***h face. Then when they speak to me I start smiling and they realise Iaposm friendly. To be honest I think people use it as an excuse to talk to me.When I do a TikTok people even use the resemblance as a cuss. They call me the Walmart Kylie Jenner. But to be honest thataposs still a compliment. She is stunning.The thing is people think I try to look like her on purpose but I donapost. However, while they certainly look similar, Julia notes that their taste in men dfers somewhat, revealing: All my ex-boyfriends have had the same kind of look. All blue eyes and blonde hair. I do think Travis [Scott] is good-looking but heaposs not my normal type. Juliaaposs many Instagram followers just canapost get over the similarities, with one person writing, Oh my goodness, Kylie Jenner is you  Iaposm shocked, you really look like Kylie Jenner, absolutely stunning.

One man is reportedly finding it very hard to understand - so much so that heaposs going to ask his partner for a maternity test.According to a Reddit post, which has gone viral on social media, the man, known only as Dan, has been in an on off relationship for a while and his partner is now pregnant.

Taking to Redditaposs Am I The A**hole forum, a friend of Dan claimed: AITA for calling my friend an idiot for wanting a maternity test My friend Dan recently found out he might be a father.

She offered to get a paternity test once the baby is born and doesnapost expect any kind of support until they find outthe baby is his. Heaposs on board with that and appreciates that sheaposs not pushing him into fatherhoodthe baby isnapost his. The issue is that when he was talking to me about it, he also said he wants to get a aposmaternityapos test done to make sure the baby is hers. Kara is visibly pregnant. We know sheaposs pregnant because she did a maternity photoshoot and posted it on social media, so itaposs obvious sheaposs not faking being pregnant. Weaposve both seen her in person, too and sheaposs most definitely pregnant. However, Dan believes that the baby might not be hers.  The friend says theyaposve tried to explain to Dan that this isnapost how biology works and that the only way the baby wouldnapost be hers isshe had an embryo implanted in her. However, they donapost think this is likely, as they continue to say: Itaposs ridiculous to think that sheaposd do all that just to baby trap a guy who is unemployed and living with his parents at . Plus heaposs never donated sperm.Heaposs genuinely convinced that the baby might not biologically be hers despite not only me, his mom, and our other friends explaining that thataposs not how babies  pregnancy works. Heaposs still insisting on a aposmaternityapos test and told me that I was being ridiculous and that Iaposm the one who doesnapost understand biology despite me studying to be an autopsy pathologist which has required quite literally years of biology classes.I got fed up and called him a senseless idiot and told him to call me when he got his head screwed back on straight. Ever since then heaposs been spamming my phone and has gotten a couple of our friends to spam me as well, telling me Iaposm being insensitive and heaposs just stressed about possibly being a dad. So, AITA for calling my friend an idiot  Thousands of people responded to the post, with many agreeing the friend was right to call Dan out. One person replied: Tell him that to help with his stress you found a free maternity test - stand in a delivery room and seea baby shoots of out of a hooha. Another said: I’m legit crying laughing right now, sorry you have to go through this.

Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine  days ago and UK spies are said to have been increasingly certain of Putinaposs plans after tapping into social media messages.The intelligence services gave the information to Ukraine to help in anticipation of a full-scale invasion, only keeping back some details to protect sources and methods.

It meant we were very au fait with the plans and the imminence of the invasion, right down to details such as the movement of blood supplies to the Russian troops.It comes as brave Ukrainians marched towards Russian troops in the city of Melitopol and told them to go home, forcing the soldiers to retreat while firing their guns above the demonstratorsapos heads. Citizens had been given a five hour window to flee the bombed-out city, only for fighting and strikes to cause many to immediately seek shelter orto their homes.Crowds hailed President Volodymyr Zelensky, chanting “Zelensky is a good guy, Putin’s a f***ing jerk”. And efforts to evacuate Mariupol were halted as Russian shelling of escape routes continued despite a ceasefire.Ukrainians trying to flee the city during a five-hour ceasefire had to seek shelter after Russian forces continued shelling, it has been reported.

But, despite a promise by Home Secretary Priti Patel to stand “shoulder to shoulder” with the Ukrainians, many are being refused visas as they are not “immediate family”. We can reveal refugees in Calais are being told to apply to other European countries instead.Tonight Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper branded it “a disgraceful situation” and demanded an explanation from Ms Patel. Refugee charity CareCalais, which is trying to help families enter Britain, also reacted with fury.Follow all of of todayaposs news on the war in Ukraine as it unfolds with our live blog  A spokesperson said: “Our Government must do more. If they want to show solidarity with Ukrainians it will take more than words.” Ukrainian-born British citizen Victoria Perebeynis, , who teaches English, travelled to the Polish border at Krakowiec to collect four members of her extended family. She planned to take them to her home in Oxford, but said: “The British Embassy told us to fill out application forms, which were rejected. And they have been told they need to apply for other countries.”  The relatives Victoria wants to help are her cousin Valentina, , her daughter-in-law Maiia Magda, , Maiia’s son Glib, , and her mum Ekateria Pergat, also  and disabled.Maiia’s husband and older son stayed in Ukraine to fight the Russians.The terried family, from the shelled Energodar region, travelled for four days to reach France. Victoria said: “Valentina is so distraught and depressed. We couldn’t open the windows on the drive as she was terried someone would shoot at her. She and Ekateria still think they are being attacked. They have lost everything. They travelled across Europe with one sock between them and one piece of underwear. That’s all they had when they got to the border.  “Their whole lives have fallen apart.”CareCalais is helping the family appeal the visa rejection. There are around  Ukrainians at the Centre Europeen de Sejour in Calais. More are expected. But our strict entry criteria only applies to parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren and siblings of British residents. A Government scheme to allow refugees inthey can get sponsored by an inidual or organisation is not up and running.  Boris Johnson committed to taking , refugees. But other European countries have acted faster and pledged to take in many more.Ms Cooper tonight said: “Families who have fled the Russian bombardment and are desperately trying to find sanctuary with relatives here should not be ending up stuck in Calais because of the Home Office. “This is shameful. Priti Patel needs to explain this disgraceful situation. People need help now.” The Home Office said the sponsorship route is “opening soon”. But they could not tell us when it will start. Meanwhile Ukrainians working here as fruit and veg pickers are panicking over confusing changes to their visas. They have been extended but the pickers can only work for the farmers who sponsored them – who may not extend their contracts.

As the conflict rages, footage has emerged from across the ravaged country showing how unarmed civilians have climbed on top of armoured vehicles and barricaded routes into their towns and cities to halt the advance of Russian convoys. Others have hurled Molotov cocktails at vehicles as they resist occupation – while some bravely confront Kremlin troops unarmed.Here, we give the stories behind some of the astonishing images of the everyday men and women battling Vladimir Putin ’s forces. Bila Tserkva, near KyivJust  miles from Kyiv, Ukrainians from all walks of le have been keeping their spirits up by making Molotov cocktails. They began after officials issued advice to civilians on how to launch the petrol bombs at enemy tanks to help repel their advance. And across the nation, people are now flocking to help manufacture them en masse. Follow all of of todayaposs news on the war in Ukraine as it unfolds with our live blogOne video shows Bila Tserkva locals laughing as they go about their work in woodland. An elderly woman grins at the camera while the man filming her says: “Look at this ‘smoothie’.”He then adds defiantly: “You will burn, occupants, andnot we will help you for sure with that. Glory to Ukraine!” Bucha, near KyivThe city of Bucha, also in the wider Kyiv region, has suffered a relentless onslaught over the past week. One video shows roads strewn with rubble after fighting intensied, bringing the town to the brink of destruction. Smoke billows through the streets as one man surveys the wreckage and he tells the Russian forces: “Guys, that is what is left near my house. I will find a way to repay you.”  On Thursday, Ukrainian forces claimed to have liberated Bucha, raising the country’s flag above its town hall and saying: “Glory to Ukraine and its soldiers.” But locals have been playing their part too. Footage from last week shows Russian heavy military equipment engulfed in flames after a resident reportedly launched a Molotov cocktail at it.Kupiansk, KharkivKupiasnk, near Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv, is no stranger to the brutality of occupation. During the Second World War, German forces arrived in July  and stayed until the Soviet army liberated the population seven months later. But on February , it was Russian forces that took over as part of Putin’s bloody invasion. The town’s mayor, Hennadiy Matsehora, surrendered in exchange for peace. Ukraine has now indicted him for treason. Yet fearless locals refuse to submit to Kremlin aggression.  Footage shows unarmed students waving Ukraine’s flag in a square. And when an armoured car approaches, they crowd around it, forcing it to slow down. One young man climbs on top and tries to break the windscreen with his foot. The car speeds up and he is thrown from the roof – but as it rolls out of sight, another man launches a stick at it.Enerhodar, ZaporizhzhiaEnerhodar became a flashpoint this week when Russian forces attacked its nuclear power plant – Europe’s largest.They seized control by shelling it but thankfully a disaster which would have dwarfed Chernobyl was averted as no radioactive material was released.Ukraine remains in control of operations but fears of a disaster remain.  Yet residents are doing everything they can to stop Russian forces advancing. Barricades made of tyres, planks of wood and metal spikes have sprung up. In some cases, their efforts have worked as footage shows a military column having to reverse.Melitopol, ZaporizhzhyaRussian forces arrived in Melitopol on February  – a day after the invasion began. Days of fighting ensued, with reports an emergency rescue unit was shelled. On March , mayor Ivan Fedorov said the city was occupied. But furious residents took to the streets to halt the Russian advance. A video shows a soldier pointing his gun at them as they chant: “Occupants!” Seconds later, he fires a warning shot and a man yells: “You’re fascists! Would you shoot civilians ”When the Russian column tries to advance, people throw themselves in front of it. And as it finally breaks through the crowd, the locals cry: “Murderers! Murderers!”Nedryhailiv, SumyIn the town of Nedryhailiv – home to , – a resident was filmed lobbing a Molotov at a Russian armoured vehicle as an onlooker shouts: “Good job!” And an unarmed man tells Russian troops: “Glory to Ukraine.” When told to stop shooting his video, he says: “Why  The Ukrainian constitution allows for filming.”OdesaPutin is desperate to seize the port city of Odesa, as it could open up a corridor to Kyiv from the south. Its strategic location on the Black Sea coast means it plays a vital role in the Ukrainian economy – so losing it would be a hammer blow. Naval and ground forces are said to be en route and last week, locals were preparing to greet them with Molotovs and makesht weapons.Koriukivka, ChernihivIn March , , of Koriukivka’s residents were massacred by Nazi soldiers in just two days. A week later, some elderly residents ed, thinking the SS troops had gone. But the troops came back and burned them alive. Now, its people face a dferent aggressor – yet they refuse to yield to the Russian forces.  Footage from last week shows a brave woman marching up to a convoy of enemy tanks and confronting the soldiers, despite being completely unarmed. Trying to reason with them and appeal to their consciences, she tells them: “I understand, you are soldiers. You cannot just give up. But you can say, ‘Our heavy equipment has broken down.’ You don’t want to discuss anything with us, even though we ask you.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Black SeaVladimir PutinSoldiersRussia Ukraine warUkraineSunday Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

What can we do, in the face of the suffering of young and old, and the frightening prospect of a wider European war  Respect, then, to the Merseyside dockers who refused to unload Russian oil bound for Stanlow Oil Refinery, Cheshire, in solidarity with the Ukrainians. The Government has already banned vessels owned, operated or chartered by Russia from our ports but those registered with other countries can still transport Russian products to Britain. In highlighting what trade unions say is a loophole in UK sanctions, the dockers have shown that iniduals can make a dference.They should be praised for standing by Ukraine. We echo their call for the Government to change the rule that would have allowed a German vessel to unload its Russian cargo on our shores. Companies have been trying to do their bit as well by depriving Russian consumers of their goods or closing their Russian stores, to heap pressure on Putin’s regime. They, too, deserve praise. But some big names – among them McDonald’s – have failed to pull the plug. It’s time for them to act and to put principles before profit. Still walking in fear The women and men who joined vigils after the death of Sarah Everard a year ago hoped they could make a dference. They believed her rape and murder might be a turning point, sparking action to make the streets safer. So it’s heartbreaking to learn that since Sarah’s killing by a serving police officer, there have been almost , attacks on the streets of England and Wales. The chilling statistics, from app WalkSafe, also highlight where most attacks take place. Car parks are worst, followed by areas near sports and recreation facilities, and supermarkets. As WalkSafe co-founder Emma Kay says, it’s awful to think these attacks are happening as women are doing everyday things. While the horrors of war rightly dominate the headlines, we must not forget the issue of violence against women, to ensure Sarah has a lasting legacy.

About  mothers and their infants cowered in cramped conditions in the basement of a maternity hospital in Odesa. Heartbreaking footage showed babies –just hours and days old – being nursed and laid out in cradles by their anxious mums. The sobering video was posted online by Ukrainian journalist Oleksiy Matsuka.Nina Sorokpoud, of the kids’ charity Unicef, said: “Mothers with newborns are hiding from shelling and air attacks in a small space of the maternity hospital bomb shelter in Odesa. “Tens of healthcare facilities came under attack last week as fighting escalates around Ukraine.Ukraine children need peace from the day they are born.”  Hospitals in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol have all come under fire from Russian troops.Two Ukrainian maternity hospitals were reportedly attacked by Russian missiles. Ukraine’s foreign ministry posted a video appearing to show troops destroying a facility hospital in Zhytomyr. First deputy minister of foreign affairs Emine Dzhaparova said: “Russian armed forces keep attacking maternity wards, kindergartens, orphanages, hospitals. One hospital has set up a neonatal intensive care unit in a basement. Doctors have warned a lack of specialist drugs and medical equipment mean some tots born in dangerous conditions will not live.  Heartbreaking scenes of tiny tots being cared for in makesht shelters have been shared by medics throughout the invasion of Ukraine.

There,  or so kids are trapped by their own bodies.Without the dialysis machines they may die. If they stay in war-torn Kyiv, they may die. Friday’s news of Russia ’s capture of Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant and gains in the south was bleak. So a young woman becoming red-nosed clown Chou-Chou – “Crazy-Crazy” – and getting sick kids to laugh out loud showed how the ordinary, ­extraordinary people of Ukraine can turn terror into sheer, bloody brilliant joy. It stabbed me in the heart.As the desperately poorly kids giggled, cracked jokes and gave me the thumbs up, I was in tears behind my mask. Grief is common in Kyiv but so is ­anger. The Kremlin hates free speech, reporters, democratic argument, MPs mouthing off or comics poking fun – all of which you can see on Ukrainian TV. Follow all of of todayaposs news on the war in Ukraine as it unfolds with our live blog  Vladimir Putin ’s solution  Fire ­missiles at Kyiv’s TV tower. I hitchhiked to the tower to inspect the damage, where I was challenged by Rost, a Ukrainian in a dark hoodie armed to the teeth.Everywhere you go you get challenged by men with guns. A Russian missile had punched a hole the size of beach hut in the TV control building. There was a bright patch of red against the rubble and snow. The worker’s body had been removed but his blood had not been washed away. I asked Rost what he did before the war. “I used to be a hot air balloon pilot,” he replied. In Ukraine, the surreal comes as standard. Across a road two more Russian missiles had overshot their target and hit a row of shops, some of which were still smoking.  In front of us were the bodies of an old man, a mother and her child. Men from the ­mortuary came out and placed blankets over the dead. Yet the Kremlin insists it is not targeting civilians in Ukraine. That is a lie. This is not Russia’s war. Its soldiers don’t want to kill their Ukrainian ­grannies in Kyiv and are abandoning their heavy machinery. On social media you can see Ukrainian tractor boys towing a million tank and three lads on a side-car stealing a Russian gun, and laughing their heads off. The Ukrainian army are the world’s best warriors. Last time Russian soldiers voted with their feet was in  and things did not go well with the old Tsar. More than a century on, things are not going well for the new Tsar.Putin’s grip on power is weakening by the day as the rest of Russia realises that he no longer has full control of his military machinery. He can huff and bluff buthis soldiers don’t want to kill people, he has a problem. How many people die before good Russia rises up against him is the critical question of our time. In , a Russian BUK missile shot down MH, the Malaysian Boeing jet packed with  holiday makers and crew. I stood in a cornfield in ­pro-Kremlin rebel-held eastern Ukraine surrounded by aircraft engines, the stink of kerosene, paperbacks, plane seats and corpses. That September, thanks to my clever Panorama producer, I was able to pose as a professor at a museum opening and quiz Putin about the shooting down of the passenger jet. He gave one of his long, monotonous replies blaming the Ukrainians for the mass murder he was responsible for. In the flesh, he came across as curiously effeminate. You won’t hear that on Russia Today.  Here Boris Johnson, ever the ­cunning populist, has been banging the ­pro-Ukrainian drum but it’s too little, too late. I have been an enemy of Putin since I saw the evidence of his army’s cruelty in Chechnya in . The European Union quickly threw open its doors to anyone with a Ukrainian passport for the next three years, no questions asked.It was Friday before the British Government followed suit. A Tory minister had said some Ukrainians could come in, so long as they picked fruit. Johnson’s government has been mean with the ordinary poor Ukrainian but sanctions against Putin’s oligarchs have been slow to bite and will probably be easily sidestepped. Roman Abramovich has known links to Putin but his ­biggest yacht has been allowed to slip into ­international waters. The reason is, I believe, that Moscow gold has long been more important to Johnson’s gang than Ukrainian and Russian blood. Johnson and company have made sure “Londongrad” has stayed a safe place for Russian money throughout Putin’s crimes against British people and British interests. On Friday my ordinary email was hacked and the IP address turned out to be somewhere near the Kremlin. I have changed my digital security. When I say the Kremlin is out to get me I’m not being paranoid – it really is.

Putin was snapped with singer Paul McCartney before a concert in Moscow in , sat with actor Jack Nicholson at the Moscow International Film Festival in  and was even in correspondence with Pamela Anderson. He had drinks with Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio at the International Tiger Conservation Forum in Saint Petersburg in  and shook hands with British supermodel Naomi Campbell at the same event.As well as these celeb acquaintances, Putin has actually developed close friendships with a few Hollywood stars, who have been reacting to Russiaaposs war on Ukraine. Around the world, Putin is losing allies fast with many condemning his terrying invasion and attacks on defenceless civilians, with the Russian leader promising worse is yet to come.So how has this changed the way his famous friends think about him  Steven Seagal Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Hollywood actor Steven Seagal has a surprising friendship with Putin - and has even been to his home. The Under Siege and Hard to Kill star, who received his Russian citizenship in , first bonded with the Russian leader over a shared love of martial arts. The Michigan-born actor has previously described his father as pure Russian, as his paternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants, and he still has some relatives in the country.Unsurprisingly, Seagal did not put any blame on Putin over the Ukraine war and has claimed an outside entity is provoking both countries into fighting.The -year-old martial artist told Fox News Digital that he looks at both Russia and Ukraine as one family. Most of us have friends and family in Russia and Ukraine, he said on Monday as he refused to take sides. I look at both as one family and really believe it is an outside entity spending huge sums of money on propaganda to provoke the two countries to be at odds with each other. My prayers are that both countries will come to a positive, peaceful resolution where we can live and thrive together in peace.  Seagal has spoken out in praise of Putin on several occasions, including in a  interview with Russian TV channel RT when he said Putin was one of the greatest world leadersnot the greatest world leader alive today. He went on: The first time I went to his home, I walked in and saw a le-sized statue of Kano Jigoro, who is the founder of judo, so I was immediately taken and impressed and really wanting to get to know this man deeper and deeper. In , Seagal met with Belarusan president Alexander Lukashenko to eat carrots and chat about that yearaposs harvest. That year he was also granted his Russian citizenship, resulting in him being barred from entering Ukraine. This [was his] desire, he had really applied, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov announced to the press. He had been really persistent for a long time and been asking to grant him citizenship, he is actually renowned for his quite warm feelings toward our country. He never made a secret out of it, at the same time he is quite famous, as you know, actor. In , Seagal appeared on Good Morning Britain live from Moscow to defend Putin amid claims he had influenced the American election.  Speaking about his Russian citizenship, he said: I have lots of relatives in Russia and you know I love Russia, I love the country, I love the people and, you know, I think that one thing that’s sort of not widely known, there are millions and millions of people in America who have dual and multiple citizenship so this is not an uncommon thing. The thing that makes it controversial is all of the propaganda flying, particularly from America about Russia, therefore it becomes kind of a controversial situation. He told Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid heaposd had many direct dealings with Putin as he lavished praise on the Russian leader. Seagal said: As I’ve said many times I think he’s one of the great world leaders, he’s brilliant, he’s articulate, he’s a great tactician. Him and I started out becoming friends over the martial arts. The martial arts has to do with a lot of things. It’s a philosophy, it gets into the history of tactics and the history of the world and the world in conflict and the world in peace and so him and I basically, we don’t have a political relationship, we really talk about the martial arts and the philosophy and people and dilemmas in le, that kind of thing. American podcaster Joe Rogan recently shared an image of a fake CNN report depicting Seagal wearing special forces unorm and holding a gun. The fake news report tried to claim Seagal was among Russian special forces positioned around the outskirts of Kyiv. Gerard Depardieu  French actor Gerard Depardieu has been one of Putinaposs closest celebrity pals - but their friendship could be coming to an end as he has somewhat surprisingly denounced the fractricidal war. The -year-old, who has starred in Cyrano de Bergerac and  Dalmatians, actually received Russian citizenship after turning his back on his homeland.Depardieu annoyed many of his fellow countrymen by running off to Russia, which was apparently to avoid paying large taxes in France after a highly publicised tax row.Putin himself signed the decree granting Russian citizenship to Depardieu, who described Russia as a great democracy, and not a country where the prime minister calls one of its citizens shabby. The actor responded by writing an open letter saying: I love your country, Russia - its people, its history, its writers. I love your culture, your intelligence. Depardieu travelled to Russia in  to be officially given his Russian passport and had an audience with Putin. The pair shook hands and hugged each other at the meeting in Sochi, although the presidentaposs spokesman said he did not hand over the document personally.  The actor was later invited to set up home in the central Russian region of Mordovia, known for its Stalin-era prison camps. Local governor Vladimir Volkov said Depardieu could choose an apartment or a place to build a house, Interfax news agency reported. After arriving in Mordoviaaposs main city of Saransk, the actor showed off his new passport, saying: I am very happy, itaposs very beautul here. Beautul and soulful people live here. In , Depardieu caused outrage in his native France by appearing in a aposnauseousapos advertisement in which he boasted about shooting a deer and being a Russian. Proud to be Russian said the actor, who was then seen kneeling over a dead dear and blowing a kiss. , the online French news outlet, meanwhile called the advertisement vulgar, while GQ magazine said it was a mixture of nauseous wordplay and pathetic production quality. But now the love-in between Putin and Depardieu may be coming to an end as the the actor denounced Russiaaposs war with Ukraine. In a shock move, the film star posted a photo on Instagram with the message: Russia and Ukraine have always been brother countries.Although he did not call out Putin directly and called on both nations to start negotiating for peace. I am against this fratricidal war, he added. I say, Stop the weapons and negotiate.apos However, the Ukrainian people are unlikely to change their opinion on Depardieu because of his past links. Back in , the Ukrainian government included the French actor on a list of cultural figures who were a threat to the countryaposs security. While no specic reason was stated, it is believed the decision is linked to controversial comments he made questioning Ukraineaposs independence. At the Baltic Pearl movie festival in Latvia in , Depardieu said that he loved both Russia and Ukraine, which is part of Russia.

Footage of the chopper being downed in a field by a surface-to-air missile emerged amid claims Vladimir Putin has lost around , men in just  days.Former British Army chief General Lord Dannatt told the Sunday Mirror he fears the dictator could turn to nuclear weapons in an attempt to turn the tide. The terrying warning came after Ukrainians posted a clip online showing the chopper – believed to be an MI- Hind Gunship – being shot down in flames by their forces. Follow all of of todayaposs news on the war in Ukraine as it unfolds with our live blog  It crashed to the ground before exploding in a fireball. A caption on the footage said: “Glory to Ukraine.”Earlier, Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky defiantly declared his forces were killing up to , Russian soldiers a day.The death toll is a devastating blow for Russia, which has more than , active personnel.By comparison, the Soviet Union lost around , soldiers in Afghanistan in  years – and that conflict helped fuel the collapse of the communist state.  Ukraine, which is thought to have lost around , troops, also claims hundreds of Russian tanks, armoured vehicles, helicopters and fighter aircraft have been destroyed. Sources said the Kremlin was “demoralised” by the losses and the additional , wounded. Those killed include Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky, , who was shot by a sniper trained just days earlier by the SAS.  Two other senior Russian officers – one isional and one regimental commander – have also perished. Many of the Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine are believed to be just  and poorly trained. POWs have been seen telling their captors they had no idea they were being sent into battle and claimed they thought they were on exercises. Bullying and the abuse of young recruits is also re in the Russian forces.  One source said: “Le for young recruits in the Russian Army is brutal. It is little wonder why so many soldiers are surrendering.” Gen Dannatt told how the Russian generals’ inability to mount a major all-arms operation had been “woefully exposed”. He said: “Moreover, their battlefield leadership has been appalling.  “The absence of clearly explained reasons for the operation to their troops has been verging on criminal – asking young men to risk and lose their lives without knowing why. “Conscripts believed they were going into Ukraine as liberators and peacekeepers and were shocked to find themselves opposed. The true Russian casualty figure will be very high, and probably never known.  “To compound things, it would appear officers have been abandoning their soldiers – trapped in their vehicles on the huge northern convoy – in order to save their own skins. This is a moral and military failure of the highest order.” Gen Dannatt said he believed the war would become a stalemate, but expected Putin’s army to advance further in the coming weeks.He said: “The Russians will start to make some progress as a result of their superior air and fire power. The big battalions usually win. “However, this could all take time and time is not on Putin’s side as sanctions and international isolation begin to bite. There must be a negotiated settlement, but who will facilitate that  Putin hates the West, but he fears China. “The US should be using deniable back channels to talk to the Chinese to persuade them to put an arm around Putin and guide him to the conference table – a ceasefire first, then discussions about Ukraine’s future status, probably a form of neutrality akin to Austria.”  Gen Dannatt warned Putin could fire a tactical or battlefield nuclear weapon to topple Kyiv. He said: “The Russians might consider using a tactical nuclear weapon to break a deadlock – north of Kyiv to gain entry, perhaps. A nightmare scenario.”Last week, Putin announced he had placed his nuclear forces on “high alert” and battles that raged around the remains of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant raised fears of potential nuclear fallout.On Friday, Russian troops were accused of risking a catastrophe after a missile strike at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant caused a fire in an outbuilding.  Putin’s forces have progressed in south and east Ukraine, but an armoured convoy more than  miles long is stuck north of Kyiv. Gen Dannatt said the failure to attack the capital so far suggested Russian chiefs were hoping to “envelop” the city from the south. However, it is thought the convoy’s problems may be hampering plans. Many of the vehicles are believed to have run out of fuel or be stuck in mud and the soldiers are looting local homes for food. Defence sources say Ukrainian ambushes, the destruction of bridges and poor planning have all had an impact. The unfolding horror has forced more than million people to flee Ukraine, but the country’s State Border Guard Service said , men had ed from overseas to fight.

Troops from the UK, US and Ukraine have reportedly come together at a remote base in Lithuania to plan the treacherous mission.Russian Spetsnaz special forces are now said to be targeting Zelensky and he has survived three assassination attempts in a week after plots were foiled by double agents. The brave Ukrainian president has also already turned down rescue offers, saying: I need ammunition, not a ride, in response to American forces.It comes as Zelensky confirmed he spoke to the US President, Joe Biden, discussing security, financial support and continuation of sanctions against Russia. As part of the constant dialogue, I had another conversation with the President, Zelensky wrote on Twitter.Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog Around  UK elite soldiers and  US Navy Seals are training for a rescue mission alongside Ukrainian forces, The Sun reports.“The most likely sensible option could be to relocate Zelensky out of Kyiv where he could be picked up. We have aircraft but the distance is critical,” a senior source said.It comes as Vladimir Putin said Western sanctions were akin to a declaration of war, as his forces pressed their assault on Ukraine on Saturday for a th day.The Kremlin said the West was behaving like a bandit by cutting economic relations and Putin warned any attempt to impose a no-fly zone in Ukraine would lead to catastrophic consequences for the world.Meanwhile, Israelaposs Prime Minister Naftali Bennett met with Putin in the Kremlin to discuss the Ukraine crisis, then spoke with Zelensky by phone.Israel has offered to mediate in the conflict.And refugees keep pouring out of the country with number of Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion predicted to rise to . million by the end of the weekend, the head of the UN refugee agency s aid. This is the fastest moving refugee crisis we have seen in Europe since the end of World War Two, the UN refugee agency head, Filippo Grandi said. The sanctions have hit me very hard. Prices are already up around % ... you already canapost buy some medicines. Things will get worse, Lidia, a freelance worker from Rostov, describing the impact of sanctions on Russians.

The indiscriminate bombing of civilians we see on our TV screens, reports of Russian soldiers raping Ukrainian women, the ceasefires in which the Russians do not cease firing. And the children in dire need of continuous cancer treatment forced to break off to cower from bombs in basements. Yet despite the pain and anguish, and the odds stacked against them, the people of Ukraine are an inspiration for their resilience and defiance. It takes superhuman courage combined with boiling anger for unarmed civilians to confront trigger-happy Russian soldiers and tell them to clear off.If that was all it took to win this war then the invaders would be scuttling out of the country with their tails between their legs. But that is the stuff of movies, not real le. And Ukrainians must brace themselves for the suffering to get worse as Vladimir Putin tightens the noose around their key cities. There are a number of ways in which this war might be brought to an end, but they grow fewer the longer it goes on. The nightmare scenario is that Putin, frustrated by the lack of progress made by his troops, might turn to battlefield nuclear weapons. He has already shown scant regard for the fallout that would cause, by shelling Ukraine’s largest nuclear power plant. It is possible President Xi of China, the only world leader Putin respects, might broker a negotiated settlement. But NATO is less likely to make the concessions that would require, given how Putin’s behaviour has shown the need – more than ever – for a strong defensive alliance. It is possible that ever more restrictive sanctions will convince Putin that withdrawal from Ukraine is preferable to his country’s economy being suffocated. But Western intelligence chiefs are united in the belief that now Putin has gone into Ukraine he cannot come out without a victory, no matter the cost. It is possible that Putin’s own people might get rid of him, so appalled will they be at bodybags piling up and the empty shop shelves they will face in towns and cities. Unlikely as his toppling may seem it would be the best outcome for Ukraine, for Europe and for Russia. But the generals and the spymasters would have to risk their lives to stand up to him. And it would need the oligarchs, stripped of luxury yachts, London mansions, shell companies and other ill-gotten gains, to support them. With Putin gone and a new leader for a new Russia, Ukraine could be ed to its people. With Putin gone the West could reassess its security necessities and open fresh talks over the NATO presence on Russia’s borders. With Putin gone we could once again live in peace and friendship with the Russian people we have no quarrel with. The world would be an infinitely better place, with Putin gone.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

We just want to keep going like that.“I don’t think look too much at the table, where we are, how many points – I don’t care too much, to be honest.“I just take it game by game and want to win every game, because obviously it’s much more enjoyable.

I’m very happy, pleased to be back playing  minutes because it’s been a long time but it went very well.“Thomasasked meI felt OK to play  minutes and I said for me that’s no problem.

If you are sure you know something to be the case beyond contradiction, you don#t need faith.Doubt, on the other hand, is strongly linked with faith because, while you may have faith strong enough to move mountains, there is always the possibility your faith is misplaced.I would argue the existence of God is proven by large amounts of evidence, but in the end that is a matter of faith.The Bible recognises this right at the start where Adam and Eve leave the Garden of Eden and do not see God face-to-face anymore.From now on, they, and we who come after them, must live by faith.This is what it is to be human – and faith is always open to challenge.When suffering occurs, when disaster looms, people ask, #Where was God # and use what has happened to deny God exists.Yet the faithful keep believing. Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"oban golfer bob shines in californian sun","story":"With  top  world-ranking players in the field, the honorary Machrihanish Golf Club member was going head-to-head with the one of the strongest fields assembled outside a major championship.Having shown signicant signs of ato form in his previous two tournaments in the United Arab Emirates, this was a chance for the left hander to build on his progress and climb back towards the top  in the world rankings.An opening level par  on Thursday left Bob in the middle of the pack after day one.

The mine was finally rediscovered by HMS Bicester early last week.Bad weather made it impossible for the crew of the Bicester to attach a surface riser to it and the mine was left to a Navy ing team to bring it up.Led by Lt Adrian Dann, the four-man Northern Diving Team from Faslane finally pinpointed the mine on Tuesday morning and brought it up later that day.The two-tonne mine is currently lying on the New Quay waiting to be picked up by the mine laying team from Cromby, Fe.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown churchgoers, in common with other congregations throughout the country, are being asked to sign petition forms calling for an end to public filth in television and literature.Already many people, including non-churchgoers, have appended their names to the forms which are also in several businesses in the town.The forms are headed: ‘Petition for public decency.’It states: ‘Being concerned about the effect on society – particularly on the young – and of the increasing exploitation of sex, the public portrayal of intimate or unnatural sexual behaviour and violence and brutality, we the undersigned call upon Her Majesty’s government: to note the concern of the public about this matter. to ensure that the law as regards of sanity stops this public affront and is so designed as to be an effective instrument for the maintenance of public decency.Some church congregations in the town have already begun signing the petition and others planned to follow suit in the near future.All of Campbeltown’s ministers are in agreement that the obscenities on television and in literature are going too far, and hope that the petition has the desired effect.The Reverend James W Hood, of Lorne Street Church, commented yesterday: ‘I think it is perfectly right that the church should be given the opportunity of speaking its mind.’SEVENTY YEARS AGOThe majesty and pomp of King George VI#s funeral procession through London, and later its journey to Windsor Castle, was seen and heard by people in Campbeltown and Tarbert on Friday, in the history-making experimental television broadcast.In both places, reception was remarkably clear and those who were privileged to see it saw this royal journey of dignied and poignant pageantry in a much greater detail than the vast crowds in London and Windsor.At both places, the sets, with -inch screens, were shown by radio dealers to parties of friends.Mr Anthony P MacGrory, Campbeltown town councillor and housing convener, had his set installed in the radio showroom of his firm’s shop in Main Street.At Tarbert, the set there was arranged by Mr Douglas C Smith, Electrical and Radio Engineer, Harbour Street.Earlier last month, Mr Smith informed us that he was getting surprisingly good results from the test from the Scottish television station at Kirk o’ Shotts – the Scottish station which is using only low power transmission.Scottish TV reception of this historical occasion was the previous day viewed with serious misgivings and doubts by BBC experts, who pointed out that the Kirk o’ Shotts station was not due to open until March  and that this is the first-ever television radio link up, connecting Scotland to London, through Manchester, was merely an experiment and the Scottish transmitters were still undergoing adjustment.So, until the TV programme went onto the air on Saturday, the BBC could give no guarantee that the venture would be successful.It was a great success and thousands of Scots over a wide area, from Dumfries to Aberdeen, saw clear pictures of the funeral processions.At Campbeltown and Tarbert, the pictures were almost as clear as everyone was looking at them on the cinema screen, the detail in some of the pictures being unbelievably perfect.One local businessman, who saw it, described it as ‘uncanny’.But, throughout the years, this has been the descriptive of all great inventions when they first made their impact on the public mind.It was a pity, of course, that this great moment in Scottish television progress should have been heralded in with such a sad event as the funeral of our King.Considering that Kintyre was not regarded as a good reception area and that this  miles relay was the longest ever attempted by the BBC, the result was truly amazing and will no doubt mean the booking of many orders from this part of the country.Already, Mr McGrory has been receiving enquiries from ious parts of Argyll.We were privileged to see the screening in Mr MacGrory’s premises that afternoon. The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television network, it must have been an unforgettable experience to have this outstanding London ceremonial brought hundreds of miles to before their eyes and to be taken in imagination straight to Windsor to

What#s inside the singing kettle # # which Artie still uses today.While this principle was always central to the action, plot lines and stage sets were built around imaginative story lines, transforming the original concept into a spectacular musical for the whole family.The Singing Kettle turned children’s theatre into an art form and the troupe#s unique performances became the bench mark for fellow professionals everywhere.They performed in hundreds of venues, from the Palladium in London to the Town Hall in Campbeltown, from the Palace Theatre in Kilmarnock to the Royal Palace in Jordan.BAFTA-award winning and decorated with MBEs for services to children’s entertainment, audiences worldwide were hooked on their madcap musical adventures flavoured with cheeky Scottish humour.Adults and children alike found themselves singing the songs together long after the performances were over.The company closed in , with the final line-up forming Fun Box and with Cilla retiring.Artie continued performing solo shows as Artie#s Tartan Tales but since the beginning of  his show is now Artie#s Singing Kettle.There is a £ one price ticket for the show, plus booking fee.

We can only advertise the whole area, which is very large,’ he explained.‘But a town of this size could do a lot more in the way of advertising.’The caravan sites around Campbeltown are among the best in the west of Scotland, Mr McKinnon added.Caravanning, he says, is up and coming in the popularity stakes among holidaymakers.SEVENTY YEARS AGOThe  miners, who had been on an unofficial strike at the Argyll Colliery, Machrihanish, since Monday afternoon of last week, ed to work on Monday morning.This followed meetings of the Argyll branch of the National Union of Mineworkers and the men involved the previous night.It was decided to go back and await the report of the inspector, who, it was stated, was to make an inspection of the colliery on Wednesday.This inspector is appointed by the National Union of Mineworkers and he acts with full approval of the National Coal Board.The strike was in sympathy with two backsht men who walked out because they alleged that part of the pit, where they were working, was unsafe.However, an inspector of the Ministry of Fuel and Power, who made a thorough inspection of the colliery on Thursday, on the recommendation of the manager Mr James W Williamson, reported that the colliery was perfectly safe and that the method of working was highly satisfactory.Prior to his inspection, the men, at one of their meetings in Campbeltown, claimed that too much coal was being extracted from the section concerned and expressed their fear that it might lead to a major disaster.Mr William Marshall, president of the Argyll branch of the NUM and one of the men involved, denied that the two men who originally stopped work because of the alleged danger were men of little mining experience.He stated that one of these men had  years’ experience in mining in the Blantyre district, while the other man had  years’ experience in another Scottish mining area.He argued that on several occasions the men had to quit the road because of creaking and tearing in the roof which were, he said, the usual signs of danger."},{"url":null,"title":"hoops in whisky barrel sculpture are not in wrong order","story":"Campbeltown resident Fiona Macpherson sent a photograph of the installation to the Courier after noticing that the weathered steel rings did not seem to taper out from each end to the middle like the hoops on a whisky cask, which they are supposed to represent.#I looked at the original drawing from the plans and it looks to me like the hoops are in the wrong order,# she said. #It#s nothing like the artist#s impression of how it was going to look.#But Cosmo Blake, network engagement manager at Sustrans Scotland, said the angle of the specic photograph does make it appear as though the outer ring is wider, but #this is not the case in reality#.#To stay true and accurate to traditional whisky and herring barrels, the #taper# on the outer ring of barrels is much lesser by design,# he added.#We are conscious that the previous rendered artist#s impression images of the rings could not illustrate the final and exact angles of the rings in detail.#Named Am Baraille, the feature is part of a joint project between Sustrans and Argyll and Bute Council.It was built near Campbeltown#s New Quay as a visual marker to welcome visitors arriving into Campbeltown by ferry and to mark the start of Sustrans# -mile Caledonia Way cycle route from Campbeltown to Inverness.The six weathered steel rings representing the copper straps of a cask were said to be #informed by community workshops and research of Campbeltown#s whisky and fishing history#.#Art is a fantastic way to spark conversation, create interest and promote unique spaces,# said Mr Blake, #and this artwork, was designed with the local environment and community at its heart.#An interpretation trail, featuring quotes gained from community consultation, leads to and through the sculpture.Ms Macpherson fears these quotes, as they currently are, may be a trip hazard as some of the metal bars on which they are written are sitting slightly proud of the tarmac path.She added: #Also, in the original drawing, the sculpture looks to be set in a sandy surface but it#s actually set in white concrete which is already getting stained, and it#s surrounded by tarmac, neither of which match the surrounding pathways.#It#s an absolute monstrosity, a complete eyesore.

said.He added that the final ground surface layer was also due for completion in spring.#Once installed, it will result in a colour reflective of the rendered image,# he said.#Sustrans and Argyll and

responsibility for the completed artwork.#The weathered steel materials used are in keeping with the colour of herring and whisky barrel straps, and are incredibly durable which was a key criteria put forward by Argyll and Bute Council, ensuring that the sculpture remains vibrant in the prevailing weather of its coastal location.#The paths, sculpture and materials were all agreed between Sustrans,

week washed, dried, ironed and folded the first loads of washing through its new laundry service, after moving its headquarters from a former retail shop on Longrow to a unit at Snipefield Industrial Estate.The new Launder-Aide venture offers a same-day laundry and ironing service, with pick-up and delivery included.‘We had been looking for new premises for some time and the unit has everything we need,’ said Joan Stewart, Shopper-Aide project manager.The building has been altered to suit Shopper-Aide’s needs, with the creation of a reception office space, a group meeting room, a private office and accessible toilets, in addition to the laundry room that was already in the building.There is also a kitchen where Shopper-Aide hopes to make soup which will be sold to the public twice a week.While there are still some small additions to be made to the building, Joan said Andrew Smith, Shopper-Aide’s new landlord, and local tradesmen who have carried out work so far, have been ‘brilliant’ in helping get things up and running.When Shopper-Aide was first set up, to help people aged  and over with their grocery shopping, it was dependent on external funders to operate and pay staff salaries.Over the years, as it began to offer more services including household support, a befriending service and organising social clubs like Elderberries and Garry’s Gang according to clients’ needs and abilities, the charity introduced new initiatives to help generate its own funds.These include selling crafts created by clients at its art and crafts clubs and donated second-hand books and other items.The importance of Shopper-Aide has been highlighted during the Covid pandemic, with its outstanding work in the community earning it a Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service, the UK#s highest award for volunteers.During the first lockdown, the charity’s shopping client-base more than doubled, but an influx of volunteers who were unable to work due to Covid restrictions supported the charity to cope with the increased demand.Volunteers also helped Shopper-Aide to continue providing entertainment to older people throughout lockdown, despite not being able to hold its regular groups, by organising virtual afternoon teas and quizzes and a poetry competition.A ‘Phone Buddies’ system was also set-up, offering one-to-one phone-calls to clients.The charity encouraged its clients to knit squares as part of its ‘lockdown blankets’ project. These were then sewed into blankets which have been donated to three dferent charities to help homeless people.‘During lockdown, it was brought to our attention that it wasn’t only older people with dficulties who struggled,’ Joan said. ‘Everyone felt loneliness.‘To that end, we want to invite everyone, including older people, to come and help us at Shopper-Aide, to help support their community.‘Our volunteers come from all walks of le and are truly tremendous. We wouldn’t be where we are today without them.‘Just an hour a week of someone’s spare time would make an amazing dference to us.’Shopper-Aide is looking for volunteers across all areas of the charity’s work, although it should be noted that people must be aged  or over to drive Shopper-Aide’s vehicles.Garry’s Gang, a men-only group that meets twice a week, was the first to resume when Covid restrictions allowed.One attendee told Shopper-Aide staff: ‘I’m not going to die of Covid, I’m going to die of loneliness.’That is why the charity is keen to restart its social groups as soon as possible, initially in bubbles to ensure safety.‘The last two years, we’ve been on hold, the same the rest of society,’ said Joan, ‘but we’re starting to open our wings and are looking forward to getting back to the new normal.’Shopper-Aide has three full-time and  part-time staff who assist and coordinate volunteers.‘Our staff are very committed,’ Joan said. ‘They all do a brilliant job and go above and beyond what’s asked of them.‘The Shopper-Aide family is committed to supporting each other, and we want to become more resilient should something like Covid ever happen again.’As well as volunteering, people can also support the charity by becoming a ‘Shopper-Aide Friend’ by donating £ a year infor newsletters and the knowledge that they’re supporting a charity within the community.Call   or visit Shopper-Aide’s website or Facebook page for more information on the new laundry service or to support the charity."},{"url":null,"title":"letters march 4 2022","story":"We have recently moved to Carradale, and are loving it!I wrote this poem in praise of our new home.Carradale, O Carradale,Room to stretch, peace to workThe south might say it’s grim up northMay our days be long and all spent hereI urge you alltired and stressedThe story’s just startingTo quote a French poet, Charles Baudelaire,Best wishes.Living in a Campbeltown flat, one up from the street, with only one flat above using the same toilet waste downpipe, I was amazed tohome to find a previous #deposit# still in my toilet.My attempt to clear and flush caused the toilet basin to fill to the brim with #dirty# water etcetera and white paper.The emergency plumbers were called and two good men arrived but efforts to clear the toilet basin in the flat failed.At ground level outside, they effected an entry into the said downpipe and pulled out unpleasant #deposits# and many many wet wipes – which I do not use.They claimed to have previously attended similarly choked toilets with wet wipes.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a vegetable plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is your key to successful growing and means that you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and vegetable beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing directly into the ground at this time of year, there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option not only does it provide a warm environment for germination but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests.If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, then even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost-filled seed trays and then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost.If the seeds are big enough to handle, then you can sow them inidually into cm pots – the quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds, between five- seeds per pot.For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost-filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can then be planted outside tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill.You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots.Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and – handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots – gently tease them apart.Drop inidual seedlings into a cm compost-filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level.Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes.These can be planted from mid-March however planting times will y across the country, according to temperature and risk of frost.Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags.You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, and approximately cm deep and cm apart.Once stems are about cm tall, they will need earthing up – by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt – good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle – nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh Maris Bard – white flesh with good ‘new potato’ flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden."},{"url":null,"title":"minato-sushi-cheese-lady-boost-haddington-town-centre","story":"The Cheese Lady on Haddington High Street is moving into the former butcher premises of Colin D Peat on neighbouring Court Street.The move from High Street has opened the door for Minato Sushi to bring the Japanese delicacy to the town centre.The changing face of the town centre was welcomed by councillors Tom Trotter and John McMillan, with the new businesses set to open this summer.Jen Kerr, of Minato Sushi, stressed there was still plenty of work ahead at the business before the doors opened.The -year-old, of Port Seton, who will run the business with her boyfriend Tom Cuddy, described it as “a real dream come true”.She said: “We are really excited.

That is within expectations but what that does do is underpins the  date so I think we are more confident now that that will be the date.“One success we got from the Hunterston end-of-generation is we managed to find a job for everybody who wanted to stay here.“The staff levels do go down, there’s no doubt about it, but I’ve just done it.“Hunterston was the first station of the AGR [advanced gas-cooled reactor] fleet to reach the end of generation. I was there, I saw it all, so I’m well positioned to help Torness on their journey. We will be starting our preparations for that in the next couple of years.”Once the station stops generating power, attention will turn to defueling the reactors.That process is expected to take more than three years and will require hundreds of members of staff.Mr Forrest succeeded Tam Al Bishawi, who has moved to EDF’s new Hinkley C power station in Somerset after  years over two spells at the station.However, the -year-old is no stranger to Torness.He has lived in nearby Dunbar for more than  years and has a connection with the power station dating back more than  years.He was involved in the construction and commissioning of the station and has held ious roles, including operations manager and technical and safety manager.He was also plant manager at Torness for nearly two years from December  to September , when he was appointed acting station director at Hunterston B, near West Kilbride in Ayrshire.The “strong supporter” of nuclear power felt that Torness had an important role to play in the years ahead.The father-of-three said: “I will be painting that picture and, as I said, at Hunterston we managed to find a job for everybody who wanted to stay. If I can replicate that, it would be a real success.“That will be one of my main focuses but right now we are generating electricity for about a quarter of Scotland’s electricity needs and that is low-carbon electricity.”"},{"url":null,"title":"controlled-explosion-item-address-west-barns","story":"An official police statement to the Courier yesterday said that bomb disposal experts had carried out the controlled explosion on Tuesday - but that information was wrong.Apologising for any inconvience caused, a Police Scotland statement this morning said: \"Information initially provided relating to a controlled explosion at the address was inaccurate.

Scott Fitzgerald’s classic novel The Great Gatsby.More than one person staying informed us that the hotel hadn’t always been that way but, after a dramatic refurbishment last year, the move from bleak to chic has been swt and drastic.The Marine now offers  guest rooms, two unique food and beverage concepts, a spa, pool and fitness centre, and , square feet of flexible meeting and event spaces.Overlooking the th hole of the historic West Links course of North Berwick Golf Club, it boasts scenic views of landmarks including the Firth of Forth and Bass Rock.The panoramic and clear views of sea from the hotel are even betteryou’re lucky enough to catch the East Lothian weather on a good day.But though rainy and bleak during our stay, the views were equally breathtaking. With the lobby offering seating – and a coffee and cocktail service! – and a large welcome desk in the centre of the room, even the reception does its best to cater to the view. It would be easy to spend an entire afternoon in the lobby alone, getting lost in the town’s beauty.Its fair to say, the ‘Grand Old Lady’ is back to her former glory and better than ever...Marine Hotel, North Berwick Set on Cromwell Road, The Marine Hotel North Berwick occupies a prime position just streets away from the town’s charming beach and harbour. Its buttercream stone facade is easy to locate and its large free parking area means carrying luggage to the door is a breeze.For tourists and visitors, the hotel is in a prime position within walking distance of a iety of restaurants, some of which serve the freshest seafood from the harbour, alongside fish and chip takeaways and the well-loved and always popular Alandas Gelato.Upon entry to the hotel foyer, guests will be blown away by the sublime views out of large open windows of the iconic Bass Rock.The revamped Marine Hotel, North Berwick There’s ample free parking, a large restaurant, bar area, spa facilities, free Wi-Fi and more.The lobby at night The design throughout the hotel takes inspiration from Scotland’s world-renowned golf courses and notable figures, with nods to the hotel’s stunning seaside location and surrounding natural wonders.A deep colour palette dominates here: the lobby is a mixed wash of patterned wallpaper and dark emerald window fittings. Seating areas boast a selection of large leather couches and intimate tables of two – both of which offer stunning views of the waters that make North Berwick so popular.The hotel embraces the beauty of the wilderness on its front door, with interiors pulling from the agricultural and architectural history of the area. Local heritage is displayed through framed prints of wildle found on the Bass Rock. The refurbished style is reminiscent of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic The Great Gatsby.The lobby area boasts walls of literature As a perfect location for tourists and local visitors alike, there was a iety of visitors checking in: in the lobby, a mix of young couples and groups of friends, as well as solo visitors with their beloved pooches, socialised.The service was relaxed and without fault. Reception staff were friendly and engaging, recommending restaurants and sight-seeing activities.During checkout, staff members went above and beyond to cater to guests’ needs, with several carrying luggage out to the car park and ensuring checkout was as speedy and calm as possible.Bedside tables reflect the hotels golfing roots The hotel boasts  guest rooms, with many paying homages to iconic golf holes with nightstands designed as golf tee boxes. Guest room carpet complements the nightstands and depicts golf ball and golf club mots within the traditional pattern.Each room is somewhat unique but adheres to the core theme by using pops of deep colour and golfing mots to reflect its sporting heritage.All rooms – Marine King Suite, Marine Deluxe King Seaview, Marine Deluxe King, Marine Classic Double Seaview, Marine Classic Double – come with sizeable bathrooms, high-end toiletries, storage space, iron, safe, coffee and tea, concierge service and a mini-bar.My only criticism is the not-so-subtle patterned wallpaper featured in a number of bedrooms. I would avoid thoseyou are prone to migraines!Haggis Bonbons made a great starter The Marine’s restaurant, The Lawn, offers erse dining options and an extensive all-day menu showcasing the very best of Scottish cuisine. Main courses include options of venison, halibut and duck breast.The quality of the food is a definite selling point I’d recommend the haggis bonbons to start, while the Tweed valley beef with Chimichurri sauce makes for an admirable main course.The only distraction in the dining area was the rather bleak music played throughout dinner. Additionally, I would recommend a late dinner, with the atmosphere of the eatery heating up at around pm.Breakfast is a generous premium buffet served in the restaurant with an additional menu of warm and cooked items the French toast is not to be missed. From my understanding, the pastries on offer at the buffet are made in house and the best I’ve ever eaten.The overall dining experience at The Lawn was high class, most of all due to the eagerness and humour of our server. If you visit The Lawn, with or without a booked stay at The Marine, always ask for Richie!Cocktails created by talented bar staff are the perfect dinner treat Staff are faultless in their presentation, their unorm neat and matching they’re eager to help and accommodate.Marine Hotel North Berwick Without a doubt, the staff are among the most polite and caring I have ever met. A special mention goes to Surajit Dasgupta for his outstanding care and attention throughout the stay. His service alone would justy booking a night’s stay at The Marine.The atmosphere and charm of this hotel is so special that, despite living just a few miles down the road, it felt like a well-needed break from day-to-day le.

Staff went on strike on the first day I started. In the days of Teletext, it came up the night before ‘library staff are going on strike to meet the new director.’ For a moment I thought what a shame, but that was me,” said Dr McConnell.Read more: Glasgow aid for Ukraine appeal is launched - how you can help“Glasgow has always felt special to me and when I got the job here I couldn’t believe it. One thing I didn’t appreciate that being in Glasgow the press are much more interested than you would have imagined. That was quite a shock and took quite a bit of getting used to.“What I did know that in the city, politically, all the political parties really did want the city to succeed and that’s what I wanted to work with – that whole thing of widening access.”  After  years at the helm of it the city’s culture and leisure services, firstly under Glasgow City Council and then as chief executive of arms- organisation Glasgow Le, Dr McConnell is due to retire in May.However, she is not winding down just yet and has the small matter of the £million revamped Burrell Collection to reopen later this month. It is the latest high profile museum to open under her tenure following on from the refurbishment Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, and the opening of the Riverside Museum. Under her leadership culture and sport attendances have grown by a third to more than  million in the year before the pandemic. Glasgow Le Museums became the most used and visited museums service in Scotland, but it’s not all been plane sailing.Losing tens of millions of pounds during the local government shake up meant services were competing for any cash they could get. Library staff were on strike for eight months in the late s and venues were open for just a couple of days a week to lend books and it was looking grim for the future of those services.Read more: Craig Mallon murder: New twist as appeal made for mystery callerHowever, an opportunity to work with the then Glasgow Development Agency who had money to invest in technology began to turn things around.  Mrs McConnell, who is married to former First Minister Jack McConnell, added: “Performance indicators in our libraries were among the worst in the UK at the time, but we got through it and persuaded the council and GDA to come in and develop learning suites with computers, train up staff and in some places co-locate, which for some people is still an issue, but it was fantastic. There was objection at the time, but within weeks uncertain staff became the biggest advocate and more people were using the service.“There was no library in the Gorbals it had been shut many years before and we reopened that. We ended up extending the library service. In Pollok the library was literally falling down so we located it in the leisure centre. In Springburn we had problems with the old library building and eventually we created a two-level library with a computer suite. With co-location we had more people using the service.”An element of Mrs McConnell’s role was look at future partnerships and who  they could work with and it is how she first met the late Lord Macfarlane, who was a passionate patron of the arts in Glasgow and helped them raise £millon for the £m Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum refurbishment. He also helped the council buy the handwritten original Robert Burns manuscript of ‘Auld Lang Syne’ in  for around £,.“It came up for sale in New York and one of the library staff said to me this was happening,” said Mrs McConnell. “They said we have this amazing Burns collection but you never buy anything in Glasgow for the libraries and I thought why not “We went out and we got that manuscript at auction in New York and it is now in Glasgow. That has been at the heart of what we have been able to do. It has been about working with others and seeing opportunities as they arise. In the face of it when I started in  having lost all that money from Strathclyde and sadly we did have to make a lot of compulsory redundancies at the time, the reality iswe hadn’t gone into partnership with others and hadn’t changed how we did things we wouldn’t have had the credibility or the partners to do a lot of what we did.”It was former city council chief executive George Black who recognised that the halcyon days would not last forever and understood what was coming down the line in terms of the scale of investment for services and reductions in local government funding.In  that it was felt for culture and leisure to be successful a new way of working had to be looked and also to reduce the burden to the council given increasing demands on the likes of social care and education budgets.  This led to the setting up of Glasgow Le in , a charitable organisation that could run culture and leisure on behalf of the council, and brought an immediate saving to the council of tens of millions of pounds just in rates, along with VAT benefits.“We also recognised it would be a way of bringing in people like Lord Macfarlane on to our board,” added Mrs McConnell. “We saw this as an opportunity immediately to save money year in year out – one off saving isn’t enough and we needed to bring in people who could help us bring in additional money.”Read more: Architect behind Burrell Collection redesign says it has opened up the heart of the buildingGlasgow’s cultural and sporting successes propelled the city’s global reputation as a first choice leisure and business tourism destination.

It is the biggest city and is home to so many cultural services and resources that it directly funds through Glasgow Le, but the whole ecology whether it is support for the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, based in one of the city’s venues or the Glasgow Warriors playing at Scotstoun, it goes beyond direct funding. I believe there needs to be recognition that some of these services are nationally and internationally signicant and should be funded accordingly,” said Mrs McConnell.“I think we need to look at a dferent view of public health. It can’t just be about campaigns to stop smoking, it needs to be about how can you live a healthy le in your community and that means local resources, services whether it is libraries, sports, or development staff. We need advocates to look at ideas for the future and there needs to be a sense of urgency that we need to do something more.”  Her passion for culture and widening access, she says, stems from its ability to change people’s lives and goes back generations for Mrs McConnell whose inspiration was her grandmother Bridget Airlie, whose name appears on a remembrance plaque in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.“My grandmother was a miner’s we, had seven children and her father before her was a miner. She had six daughters and one son who was killed in the pits.“She was born in  and lived until she was . She had a huge family who were involved in the pits. Relatives had died from having lung disease – I had great uncles who were like demi-gods - grumpy and gruff - but I loved them and the stories they would tell as boys being in a pit at the age of  crawling in areas which were ft high.“Her passion was for education and my memory of her was stick in at school as this was the way out of the pits for her. For me history from  right through the th century wasn’t just in a book. I heard it and lived it listening to these people. I can remember my Uncle Thomas, who was killed in the pits when he was , his we was pregnant at the time and lost the baby, he would listen to opera such as La Traviata.“I remember during the miners’ strike, I had a lot of relations who were involved in that, there was always this dilemma – there was the pride of the mining communities but actually they didn’t want that for their kids. They wanted somewhere where they could breathe, live and they could use their brains. The thing that really struck me about my gran, who was in service as a young girl, was her teacher trying to plead with her parents about to let her stay on at school, but they were poor. Being in service wasn’t like being in Upstairs Downstairs, I think it was pretty miserable, but here was this bright woman who could recite Wordsworth and there was this sense of a great mind not challenged enough so she lived it through her children and grandchildren. The mantra for her was education, education, education. There was a passion about access to arts and that it should be there for everyone and that still drives me to this day.”  While she recognises she is extremely privileged now, she was brought up in a room and kitchen with her siblings and an outside toilet shared with another family, but she said she never once felt poor.“I felt rich and it was rich in community, the church was a big thing for us and lot of the social le, entertainment and arts experiences stemmed from there. I ended up playing organ in the Twechar Church for six years from the age of  because my gran had bought the organ in memory of her late son. I can remember the opportunities there were growing up. If I hadn’t had a full grant when I went to university I wouldn’t have been able to go.”Her first job after leaving St Andrew’s University was with Fe Council’s travelling art gallery in .  Despite the headline grabbing achievements of multi-million pound museums opening and her role in helping to bring the Commonwealth Games to the city in , which she is immensely proud of, it is some of the initiatives that have been le-changing that mean the most.“For me it is the little things. We were doing some work at the library in Bridgeton and one man talked about how the library saved his le. He had lost his job, felt suicidal, and it wasn’t just that the library provided a safe space, it is the moment when it gave a reason for living.“Seeing the change in some of the young people from the criminal justice reform programme volunteering at the Commonwealth Games – it was a moment when you see how culture and sport can change lives.\"As she looks to the future what’s next for Mrs McConnell – does she see a future in politics. And her response was not a yes, no or maybe – it was a never.“It is not a no – it is a never,\" she declared. \"Politics doesn’t appeal partly because I like to change my mind a lot, but I also have found that across all the political parties it is about being able to work with a common interest in doing more for local communities and for people. If you can work with that across parties as sometimes my experience is that parties can create ides, so no it is a never for me.”"},{"url":null,"title":"vet-uses-lockdown-learn-fly-now-offers-flying-vet-service","story":"Now what started as a fun lockdown personal challenge could become a leline for pet owners in some of Scotland’s most dficult to reach places.Having secured his licence to fly a single engine piston plane, he has focused his sights on becoming what’s believed to be the country’s first flying vet.Scott, , is a regular on BBC Alba’s series Vets: Gach Creutair Beò, which follows vets across Scotland as they administer vital care to pets and farm animals.In the programme, he is often seen in his previous role as an Advanced Practitioner in Small Animal Surgery at Aberdeen Veterinary Referrals assessing and then operating on family pets which require orthopaedic or soft tissue surgery.Having earned his flying stripes last year, he is now planning to offer his specialist veterinarian surgical knowledge and skills to pet owners in some of Scotland’s most remote areas.He said: “I had always wanted to fly and after graduating I chose the cheapest form of flying – paragliding. It’s great fun but you’re only flying at about mph.“During lockdown I had a bit more time on my hands and decided it would be good to learn to fly something more useful.“I started learning to fly out of Dyce with a flying school and managed to get my Provisional Pilot Licence in .“It started off as being just for fun. But I started working in Inverness and thought how much quicker it would be fly than travel by road.”Scott, who lives in Aberdeen, says he can now commute from there to Scottish Vet Referrals in Inverness in around  minutes, shaving around two hours off the journey by car.It also got him thinking about the benefits of being able to hop around the country by plane, reaching pets and their owners in some of Scotland’s most remote locations in a fraction of the time.As a flying vet, he plans to drop in at rural airports in his single engine plane to carry out initial assessments on injured and sick cats, dogs and other pets, to seethey would be candidates for surgery.Eventually, he hopes to be able to transport animals back to the main surgery for scans and possible surgery, saving the owners the stress and upheaval of travelling long distances with sick pets.He added: “Some places don’t have vets at all, or the vet can only go so far and then they need to take their pet to a specialist vet for further treatment.“The plane will cruise at over mph and has about five hours endurance, which opens up most of Scotland.“Depending on what needs to be done, I would carry some equipment with me, but a lot can be done in a consultation to determinethe animal even needs surgery in the first place.“That alone can help prevent people and animals having to make long journeys.”Animals would still need to travel in order to undergo specialist procedures such as CT scans and surgery, but Scott hopes that eventually he will be able to load them on board the plane and take them with him.“I’ve got to find some way of protecting their ears as it can be noisy in the plane,” he adds. “I’ve seen some dogs wearing ear protection while flying, which may be one solution.”Flying doctors are common in places like the Australian outback, where there are vast distances between properties and medical care. And while there are known to be flying vets operating in Australia, Scott is believed to be the first to cover Scotland’s highlands and islands.One challenge will be landing his plane on some island landing strips: An Traigh Mhor beach on Barra is regarded as one of the world’s most thrilling landings however, the runway is obscured twice a day by the incoming tide. While the gravel airstrip at Foula in Shetland can be doubly dficult due to crosswinds and fog.He added: “Landing in some locations will definitely be a challenge and I’ll have to do some preparation before I set off so I know what to expect and that there aren’t any restrictions.“I need to complete more examinations and training before I can fly at night and in poor conditions, both of which I will need to really make flying work.“Plus, a lot will depend on how much demand there is for a travelling surgeon.“But it’s great fun to buzz around in the plane, andI can turn up at these places and see animals there, it will save their owners having to travel.”In the new eight-part series of Vets: Gach Creutair Beò, Scott is seen operating on a French bulldog to correct a severe bend in his leg using a series of guides and templates custom made for the dog using a D printer, and assessing a dalmatian for surgery using a CT scanner.The cameras also follow Highland Wildle Park vet Jane Harley as she carries out checks on two snow leopard cubs prior to their transfer to a new home, and at Blair Drummond Safari Park, vet Ali Smith, as she anaesthetises Hope the tiger in preparation for an implant to prevent her having cubs.Vets: Gach Creutair Beò is on BBC Alba, Tuesday .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"wool-can-help-preserve-footpaths-natural-environment","story":"But while once farmers and crofters could rely on fleece to bring in a healthy income, cheaper imports, the loss of processing mills and slump in demand sent wool prices tumbling.The problem reached a peak last year, with farmers reportedly having to pay to have wool removed from their land, with piles of fleece being burned or thrown away.Now, however, a Skye crofter has tested a potential ‘carpet’ solution that would not only provide a new and sustainable use for wool but could help to regenerate Scotland’s precious peatlands.Instead of Skye wool being used to create sumptuous carpets for homes, it has been successfully used to create a thick and water repellent ‘underlay’ for an outdoor path across a peaty bog, opening the door to wool becoming a sustainable alternative to traditional plastic-based material.It has also raised hopes that the glut of wool can also be used to help rewet peatlands: tests have been carried out where involving stuffing wool into drains, securing it in place and creating an environment for sphagnum mosses to thrive and the bog to regenerate.Currently some peatland restoration projects use plastic membrane lining to prevent water draining away or involve digging deep trenches which have to be repacked with peat. That process tends to involve the use of heavy machinery, which itself can damage delicate peat environments.The wool carpet was used at a m stretch of the Kilmarie coastal path at Strathaird on the Isle of Skye, which had become particularly muddy. The path, which is looked after by the John Muir Trust, is regularly used by the community and visitors to the Iron Age fort at Dùn Ringill, and takes walkers on a scenic route past Kilmarie House, owned and lived in until  by Ian Anderson, singer and flautist with Jethro Tull.Normally the repair work would involve laying plastic membrane topped with gravel, or wood which eventually rots.However, Skye crofter and John Muir Trust Skye team member John MacRae decided to switch the plastic for sheep wool to create a ‘floating path’.The technique can be traced back to the Roman Empire, when fleeces were used in road building to create a layer on waterlogged ground. Wool was also used in the construction of railway lines in Ireland a century ago.Mr MacRae sourced around  raw and unprocessed fleeces from local crofts including around  from his own flock to use an alternative to geotextile matting.The fleeces were folded and rolled before being laid along  metres of the path, with the remaining  metres covered in the plastic-based matting in order to check how they compared.The wool-based method protects the peat and soil, allows the easy drainage of water and prevents the gravel on top from sinking into the mud.The solution is now being considered for other island paths and at other sites run by the John Muir Trust, which looks after some of Scotland’s best known sites including Ben Nevis, East Schieallion and Quinag, a mountain range in Assynt, Sutherland.The Trust maintains around km of footpaths on the Isle of Skye.Mr MacCrae said the use of wool as a foundation material for outdoor paths is at odds with days when he was growing up and wool fetched premium prices.“Older crofters talk about how the wool cheque would be enough to pay your farm rent for the whole year,” he said.“I remember as a child being told to go out and walk around the fences to pick up any spare wool, because it had a value and was worth collecting.“But the price is now so low that these days there have been people just dumping it because they can’t sell it.“I know that people this year were just going to dispose of their wool anyway they could because in theory it would have cost them money to get it to distributors or wholesalers.“I have got about  sheep, and this has helped me to get my wool away and make space in my sheds.”Farmers and crofters told The Herald on Sunday last August how they had been left earning little more than pennies, and in some cases making no money at all, for their sheep’s fleeces.In at least one case, a Western Isle crofter ended owing money to the British Wood Board money after the costs of transporting his fleece was deducted from its price.Others reported being paid little more than the equivalent price of a takeaway coffee for wool shorn from around  ewes, leading to some farmers throwing fleeces on the ground as matting to provide grip on muddy gateways, burying them, or even burning them.The collapse in price has been partly blamed on the pandemic and a slump in demand from carpet and mattress manufacturers which most ‘rough’ Scottish fleece is often used for.Using unwanted wool as a floating underlayer for paths in boggy areas and in peatland restoration would introduce a more sustainable alternative to plastic-based matting and ert fleece from landfill.Mr MacRae added: “In the past people would have used branches or beech logs to stop gravel and stones sinking in peaty areas.“This is the first time I’ve used wool and it’s very much a trial, but it’s worked really well and everything I can find suggests it will last a very long time.“All the time I was working on the path, I was thinking about where the geotextile material had come from, what it cost in terms of carbon to make and get to Skye, whereas the wool was a local product, essentially free and hasn’t had to travel to get here.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dave-cherry-salutes-edinburgh-squad-resilience-thumping-connacht-result","story":"“I think it shows the resilience of the squad,” hooker Dave Cherry said after marking his th appearance by scoring one of his team’s tries. “We have had those three losses - in tough places to go and play, mind - but we’ve bounced back and we’re delighted with that win.”Full-back Henry Immelman scored twice and was named man of the match, while the other touchdowns came from Blair Kinghorn, Emiliano Boffell, Ben Vellacott, Glen Young and Ramiro Moyano, with Boffelli converting all eight. Edinburgh played some imperious attacking rugby, with Kinghorn pulling the strings from fly-half, and the final tally was all the more impressive given how much pressure they had to endure in the opening quarter and more.Connacht led by - before the home attack got going, and Cherry put the reversal of fortunes down to good work up front. “I think momentum swings,” the Scotland international added when asked how his team had managed to turn the game on its head after being forced to defend for so much of the first half. “We got the upper hand at the maul and the scrum - I think that paid idends in the game. We kind of sucked the le out of their forward pack and we got space out wide off the maul.“I don’t know how it looked, but it felt fast, the first  minutes,” Cherry continued. “It was quite scrappy. I guess we could use thatas an excuse, but I think we showed in the end that we’re still a team and it doesn’t matter who is out, we still have people that can come in and perform. “So we’re pretty delighted with it. We need to push on now for the Glasgow game.” That first  Cup match of the season is at Scotstoun a week on Friday, a day before the last round of Six Nations matches. Both Edinburgh and the Warriors will therefore still have a host of players missing, with Kinghorn in particular possibly being a crucial absentee from the visitors’ ranks."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13547466.jpg?type=article-full","title":"hermit-treig-ken-smith-ventures-glasgow-first-time-40-years","story":"Ken Smith has spent the past four decades living in a log cabin nestled near Loch Treig in Lochaber.

Like countless others watching the invasion unfold on the news, from a position of safety, we are deeply moved and appeal for your urgency in introducing sanctions on Russian activity in the UK.#We appeal to you to take immediate action to address the activity of state-owned Russian vessels in UK waters at this time, in particular the activities by Sovcomflot oil tankers in the Northern Isles of Scotland. We are aware of the vessel NS Challenger, owned by Sovcomflot, which was permitted to take on cargo at Sullom Voe Oil terminal, in Shetland on the February .#Following the media statements from Rt Hon Grant Shapps MP, another Sovcomflot vessel NS Champion has cancelled its berth in Scapa Flow, Orkney on the March , .#It is with our disappointment that sanctions were not imposed prior to this Sovcomflot activity in Shetland, however we hope that similar commercial activity in our waters is restricted in future.#We, the undersigned, fully support the UK Government extending sanctions to mody the obligations of Open Port Duty, Section  of the Harbours, Docks and Piers Clauses Act , to be applied to the activity of Russian state-owned vessels and their use of UK ports.#Elected members of Orkney Islands Council, as the Orkney Harbour Authority, continue to uphold the Port Marine Safety Code and the obligations covered by the Pilotage Act .#The letter was signed by all  councillors.

Over the past week,  cases were recorded, bringing the case total since the pandemic began to ,.Following a meeting of the Orkney Local Emergency Co-ordination Group , on Monday morning, vice-chair of the group and corporate director Neighbourhood Services and Infrastructure, Hayley Green, said:“As the UK and Scottish Governments move forward with their plans for ‘living safely with COVID’, which includes a lessening and doing away with restrictions depending on whether you are north or south of the border, we, in Orkney, are facing something of a dilemma given that we are behind the curve.“We are seeing very high rates of transmission, and this is impacting heavily across our services – most notably within the care sector and our schools and nurseries – but really most areas are now being affected given the level of positive cases and the requirement for isolation.“We have reached the point in schools and nurseries whereby we have exhausted supply staff as a contingency and middle and senior staff, including head teachers, who were helping to keep classes open by teaching themselves or taking on janitorial or cleaning duties for example, are now also off due to COVID and other sickness.“Not only are children off due to catching the virus, but others are having to stay home due to a lack of staff – this is having a negative knock-on effect on working parents who are having to either work from homethat is possible or take time off when it is not.“It has also become apparent that we are now witnessing children in schools who have become infected for a second time.”The council stressed that schools are trying to ensure remote learning can be provided when possible – and there are enough staff to make it happen.Within adult care services, many are now feeling the impact and as a result two of our older people’s day care services on the Mainland will be closed from Wednesday as staff are deployed to assist within residential care homes. Those affected are being informed. There are further staffing challenges in adult social work and Occupational Therapy.Ms Green continued: “The closure of any service is as a last resort, but we have no choice to ensure we can safely manage to run our residential care facilities. The situation will be monitored closely and as soon as we are in a position to reopen safely then we will let everyone know.“Our care staff and the families of residents have done an outstanding job in keeping this virus at bay and out with our care facilities up until recent times but given the widespread transmission and the reduction in restrictions it has meant it was almost inevitable that this was going to happen at some point.”Staffing challenges are also being felt across the Leisure and Culture service, with some gym and swimming pool sessions and exercise classes being cancelled. The council-run St Magnus Café, Community Centre, and Town Hall have also been affected by closures and reduced opening hours.A plan has been agreed to ensure some level of service continues at the popular cafe during this challenging period and is being trialled this weekuntil the end of March, opening from .-. Monday-Friday with an amended menu.Given the infection levels, the council will be maintaining all current related COVID  restrictions for the time being, including working from homeyou can, and this will be reviewed again during March.A spokeswoman for NHS Orkney added: “We praise the community for their continued, regular use of lateral flow tests and urge everyone to continue using these. Particularly before meeting up with family, friends, travelling and attending events.“Logging lateral flow results is just as important and we ask you all to log both negative and positive results. When a positive lateral flow test is logged you will then receive information on isolation etc.“We’re continuing to ask all NHSO health care staff to continue with lateral flow testing when coming to work and this will be in place for the time being.”You can log your results by visiting: www.gov.uk report-covid-resultcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We just want to keep going like that.“I don’t think look too much at the table, where we are, how many points – I don’t care too much, to be honest.“I just take it game by game and want to win every game, because obviously it’s much more enjoyable. We’re doing everything every day to work hard every day to just deliver what is needed to get three points.”Newcastle laid the foundation for their latest victory inside three first-half minutes when Ryan Fraser and then Schar struck and, although Lewis Dunk pulled a goal back after the break to spark something of an onslaught by the visitors, the hosts held firm.Schar said: “We won the game, we’re unbeaten now in eight games, so obviously we’re all very happy, even though we know it probably wasn’t our best performance or what we can deliver.“But still,you win games where you’re probably not playing your best, it’s even better. Three points at the end is all that matters and we’re really happy about it.”If the Magpies’ current trajectory is upward, the Seagulls find themselves in something of a lull after a fourth defeat on the trot, although head coach Graham Potter was pleased with much of what he saw on Tyneside.He said: “It’s four defeats for us and prior to that, we hadn’t lost too many in the season, so that’s how the league can turn quickly.“Before that, we were on the back of an unbeaten club record in the highest league, so it is what it is.“There were lots of positives in terms of the performance – it’s a big improvement from the last couple of games we’ve had.“The boys are suffering a bit and of course we’re suffering a bit in terms of results, but we’ll learn from this and get better for it.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I’m very happy, pleased to be back playing  minutes because it’s been a long time but it went very well.“Thomasasked meI felt OK to play  minutes and I said for me that’s no problem. I feel good, I’ve been training very hard and been part of the team for a few weeks, getting used to the system they have here of how we want to play.“It gets easier every day and playing a full game obviously helps. Personally for me it has been about getting back to full fitness and being able to play football at the top level again, then let’s see where that takes me.“Obviously, I am here to help Brentford to stay up and get my own football career back on track.”Frank insisted after Ivan Toney’s hat-trick inspired a first league win in nine attempts that Eriksen could realistically play every game between now and the end of the season.The class of the -year-old was evident early on in Norfolk, with trademark long-range passes from both feet before his fine nd-minute delivery from a corner created Toney’s opener.“I wouldn’t say it was a new chapter, it is just my le continuing,” Eriksen reflected after his first competitive start in close to nine months.“Of course I have had a bit of a setback, it has taken a few months, but it has been about getting my family really back together and being back to being a normal family again.“Being here now, eight or nine months later, it is incredible. Thank you to all the people and family I have around me who supported me. I am pleased to be here.”Norwich’s fth consecutive defeat in all competitions kept them bottom and saw them booed off.The Canaries have little time to lick their wounds with Cha set to visit on Thursday, but boss Dean Smith was left frustrated with the Premier League’s decision to play the fixture so close to next weekend’s trip to Leeds, who are only six points above the basement side.“We could play Cha here on Wednesday and have two days coaching before that, but the Premier League have decided to put that on Thursday so we get hardly any coaching going into the Leeds game,” he said.“You have to deal with the hand you are dealt and we are doing that. We will keep working hard and hopefully we can turn some results around now and have some luck ourselves.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The goal came at a good time for us. It was end-to-end for a lot of the game, but we couldn’t quite get that control, so to go ahead in the game was good for us.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe Wolfe Tones during a previous performance in Falls Park.Michael Kenwood, Local Democracy ReporterMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe DUP and Sinn Fein have clashed over the Wolfe Tones Féile concerts in Falls Park, after Belfast City Council agreed to give events in public parks an annual review.At the recent monthly meeting of the full council, elected members agreed that events in city parks that seek multiple year approval will be subject to a review after each programme is finished.The agreement by elected members is a pre-policy position, in advance of the council agreeing a more structured framework and policy for events, which is currently being prepared by council officers.During a restricted discussion, away from the public and press at the council’s People and Communities Committee last month, elected members moved away from a proposal for equality impact assessments to be undertaken in regard to inidual events on council land, specically in relation to the Féile an Phobail Festival. During a party group leader meeting later it was decided to move towards an annual review for all recurring events.DUP councillor Brian Kingston said at the City Hall meeting this week: “We are happy for these recommendations to go through as approved at committee. But we will say again regarding Féile An Phobail and the use of Falls Park, that for a number of events, despite the vast majority being positive, there does continue to be a problem.”He referred specically to “the use of a council park where there is a concert, and from the stage, there is singing, and the leading of young people, and the chanting of support for paramilitary organisations”.He said: “I am referring to the Wolfe Tones concert in Falls Park, in our park. There is nothing  on the same scale as this.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up He added: “We will continually ask what steps are being made to change the nature of this event. People can look at the nature of the footage and judge for themselves, and decideit is acceptable in a council park.”Sinn Fein councillor Matt Garrett told the chamber: “Whenever we moved from committee we moved from having an equality impact assessment carried out on particular events, and in particular Féile, to having all organisations holding events being reminded of their good relations policy.”He responded to Mr Kingston: “You make reference to Féile all the time, and while you say every time you will get up and make that point, we will also remind yourself, as a party, that all events across the city have to enter a contract. All the good relations and impacts are discussed in that.”He said: “If we are going to move to the point of having equality impacts on every inidual, we can’t support that, and we would call for them across all.”Mr Kingston asked Mr Garrett: “Do you not accept there is a problem  This event is on a scale unlike any other, where there is chanting for paramilitaries, young people being led from the stage. Chanting for the organisation that caused Bloody Friday, that we have agreed to commemorate this year.”Mr Garrett replied: “Would you equally agree there are events that are happening in parks and spaces in this city, owned by the council, that are equally as annoying to other members of the community ”Mr Kingston said: “If this was happening not on a council park it wouldn’t be our business. We can’t please all of society. If we have to challenge people’s behaviour, so be it. But there is nothing in parallel with this event. I will say again, we want to see progress being made, it being accepted by the organisers, and the parties on this council, that this is a stain on the council and the Féile.”Until the finalised policy is agreed, after the annual review of each event, the council’s Director of Neighbourhood Services will decide on appropriate changes to event management where necessary, including the removal of permissionrequired.Agreed at the council were the AVA Festival Bespoke Campsite on June  and  at Victoria Park, the Féile an Phobail annual events programme at Falls Park and Dunville Park, the Circus Extreme from October  to November  at Boucher Road Playing Fields, and the Belfast Beer and Cider Festival from May  to  at Botanic Gardens.Most ReadRevealed: The cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsGAA player’s family hit by second tragedySam McBrideOpinionMLAs ‘mistakenly’ vote to force % cut on rents in latest Stormont shamblesEdwin Poots strongly tipped for South Belfast co-optionDUP and Sinn Fein clash over Wolfe Tones Féile concertsTop VideosPlayVideo: Inside Northern Ireland#s only non-ROC Nuclear bunkerPlayFuel prices in Northern Ireland are at an all time high following the Russian invasion of UkrainePlayUkrainianprotesters march through Belfastcalling for an end to the Russian invasionLatest Northern IrelandDavid Feherty: I expect Tiger Woods to contend for majors again… he could even be in the mix at The Open this summerAlliance will take a stance on constitutional question in the future, says Long‘Glory to Ukraine’: Message of support for Ukraine loud and clear at Belfast rallyConor McMenamin credits Cltonville boss Paddy McLaughlin with career turnaround as Glentoran hot-shot named Player of the MonthDavid Healy says it would be ‘abject failure’Glentoran miss league title while Linfield boss also hits out at Cltonville’s ‘part-time’ claimsLatestDavid Feherty: I expect Tiger Woods to contend for majors again… he could even be in the mix at The Open this summerNo-fly zone would not help Ukraine, says UK armed forces chiefJohn Cooney says Leinster ‘probably have a picture of James Hume up in the changing room’ ahead of revenge attempt against Ulster RugbyWe must prepare for darker days ahead in Russian aggression, PM warns alliesBBC World News taken off air in Russia, broadcaster says,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This proposal suggests this review would be triggered and full implementation required for any punter placing a bet in excess of £.Can you imagine the implications of such a proposal  It’s simply not practical and that is just one example of the proposed Codes of Practice our members have raised firm opposition to.”Representatives from both Downpatrick and Down Royal racecourses have written to the DfC expressing their specic concerns. In it#s submission to DfC#s consultation, the AIR said members have “concerns that the adoption of the draft Codes of Practice would have a drastic effect on the income that they currently receive from bookmakers which, in turn, comprises such a signicant share of their funding that it could call into question their continued existence”.Down Royal Racecourse chief Emma Meehan said horse racing is in a unique sporting position, in that it and betting are inter-dependent with most of their revenue streams linked to betting.Whilst we agree the act needs modernising and developing to ensure it is fit for the modern age in a sector that has been transformed through the rise of mobile and online gaming, we are gravely concerned over the potential impact this proposed legislation will have upon the future of horse racing within Northern Ireland a sport that is still recovering from the financial implications of Covid-,” she said.DfC said: The Minister is currently bringing a Bill – The Betting, Gaming, Lotteries and AmusementsBill through the Assembly.“The Bill includes a power to allow the Department to issue Codes of Practice. A pre-design engagement consultation was conducted on a draft Code of Practice and closed on February .The department is currently analysing the responses with a view to revising the Code of Practice and issuing for a further formal consultation later in the year.

He has previously labelled the proposals to move the four wards as ldquototally unacceptable.Mr McGrath contends there is no historical, cultural, economic or educational link between Downpatrick and Comber or Newtownards, areas currently in the Strangford constituency that would be in the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency.He said other political parties have made their stance clear via their respective submissions to the Commission, but was left ldquoaghast with Sinn Feinrsquos response which indicated that it was content with a number of areas including Malone Heights, Roughal Park, the Strangford Road, Ardenlee and Saul Acres developments and all of Saul and Strangford being removed from South Down to form part of the suggested new constituency.ldquoThe net result would be residents on either side of the Saul Road voting in dferent constituencies and I cannot comprehend the rationale for this, said Mr McGrath.The MLA said when he makes his presentation today, he will make it clear to the Commission ldquoin no uncertain terms that the proposal to move the four Downpatrick wards and much of Crossgar, Annacloy and Teconnaught into the proposed Strangford and Quoile constituency is ldquounacceptable.He added: ldquoLet us retain our links with places like Castlewellan, Newcastle and the wider South Down area and do not use Downpatrick as a scapegoat for their attempts to address wider electoral issues in Belfast or other parts of the North..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"150th anniversary of Downpatrick church  ","story":"THE Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh is to speak in Downpatrick to mark the th anniversary of St Patrickrsquos Church in the town.Archbishop Eamon Martin will celebrate mass on March th as part of a special St Patrickrsquos Novena mdash nine days of prayer mdash in the church where generations of Catholics have worshipped since .Poor Clares Sr Martina Purdy and Sr Elaine Kelly mdash who pioneered St Patrickrsquos Camino walk in Downpatrick two years ago mdash will help launch the Novena at the invitation of parish priest Fr John Murray.On March , Sr Martina and Sr Elaine, a former BBC correspondent and a former barrister respectively, will share their faith story, entitled lsquoOur Friend Patrickrsquo.The Dean of Down, the Very Henry Hull is also to take part in an ecumenical celebration on March  while the Bishop of Down and Connor, the Most Rev Noel Treanor, will celebrate Sunday mass on March .Fr John Murray, PP, said the St Patrickrsquos celebration would remember all the thousands of people who have attended mass and celebrated the sacraments in the church in St Patrickrsquos Avenue since its foundation.ldquoIt is an occasion to give thanks for those countless lives of witness and faith and to look forward to the future with confidence and hope in Christ, he said.ldquoIn , Fr Patrick OrsquoKane and the parishioners of St Patrickrsquos could not have imagined the events of two world wars and the rise and fall of Communism, the Second Vatican Council and the many other huge milestones that have come to dominate the landscape that is the th century.ldquoThey could not have imagined that  years after the church was built that we are just emerging from a pandemic.

They help to develop the museum and its collection and act as its ambassadors within the community. Members organise relevant activities as well as supporting the museumrsquos own programme of events.These activities include lectures, tours, literary and musical events, for social, educational or fundraising purposes. The Friends make grants, from their own funds or by acting as a conduit for other grant-aiding bodies who are unable to give money directly to the Museum. Such grants are for curatorial or educational purposes.At the inaugural meeting of the Friends in  the curator, Dr Brian Turner, spoke briefly about the work of the museum and plans for the future.He emphasised that community support and participation was vital and was at the root of everything the museum stood for.The first committee was elected with Patrick Forde as chairman, Dr Maurice Hayes as vice-chairman, Conac Hanna as treasurer and Noel McCann as secretary. Other committee members included Professor Ronald Buchanan, Frank Maxwell and Wendy Osborne. Since then, many other local people have given their time and skills through the committee.The Friends come from all parts of our community and even further afield. The main source of income is through annual subions, with occasional gts. However, there is also some capital as a result of a direct grant from the Northern Ireland government in . This was given in recognition of the Friendsrsquo potential for improving community harmony through peaceful exploration of our common cultural heritage. It is estimated that they have given the museum about pound, towards a great iety of projects during the last  years.However, perhaps more important is the long-term commitment the Friends have shown to the museum. They give their time, goodwill, skills, knowledge, experience and advice, on a voluntary basis, to help the museum in many ways. With their close association to the Museum they have witnessed the reduction in staff and understood the impact of the proposed restructuring.Friends in the art world, such as Richard Croft, Betty McCord and Jim Manley, have supported the museum by generous donations of their own work. Some have used their contacts to acquire works with large discounts whilst others have been able to alert the Museum to items for sale in auctions.The Friends donated Mixed farm, Slievenaman, an oil painting by Tom Carr, to mark the th anniversary of the museum, in . In , they donated Mourne Hayfield, a watercolour by Chris Dearden, to mark the th anniversary of the museum.They also purchased Silent Valley, a watercolour by Jim Manley, in , Landscape, Tyrella, an oil painting by Daniel OrsquoNeill, in  and part funded Down Cathedral and Southwell School, tempura on board by Patric Stevenson, in .The pieces of glass made by Alison Lowry, and which can now be seen at the entrance to the Cell Block, was part funded to mark the th anniversary of Friends. The inidual pieces are representations of objects associated with the lives of prisoners held in this building. The Friends also supported a residency for Australian artist Christina Henri commemorating women prisoners transported from Down Gaol.Friends with musical connections have organised tin whistle classes. The Friends also paid for a local harpist to play in galleries on summer Sunday afternoons and for the choral society at a Christmas event.Keen gardeners have brought plants into the museum to sell and opened a private garden to visitors to raise money.Car boot sales were another popular method of fundraising and the museum courtyard provided a useful venue for several organised by the Friends.Technical, photographic and conservation projects have benefited over the years from the Friendsrsquo assistance. Equipment and materials included a laminator, scanner, digital camera and archival storage. A drone pilot course was funded.The loan of St Patrickrsquos Head shrine from another museum was only made possible by its prior conservation, which the Friends paid for. One of the most important projects was the initial cataloguing of the D J McNeill Collection, by means of a placement, largely supported by the Friends.Young people have been encouraged to enjoy learning about history by Friendsrsquo funding for prizes for school competitions, poster packs for schools, and programmes for The Young Archaeologistsrsquo Club. The Education Service was assisted by the purchase of a photocopier and replica pots for children to handle.Publications have always been an important part of the museumrsquos work, in disseminating information about the collection, for setting objects in their historic context and most importantly, their relationship to people. To this end, the Friends have match-funded the annual Down Survey, - and .They assisting with the publication of two townland maps, which were freely distributed to schools and community groups. Books included A man stepped out for death, Thomas Russell and County Down, a collaborative publication to mark thebicentenary of the United Irish Rising of  and Aspects of Audleystown by Brian Turner, a book designed to help iniduals and groups study their townlands.

Restoration of St Patrickrsquos Cross and the interpretation  were financially supported.Exhibitions have benefited from the Friendsrsquo support in recent years with a major contribution to the extension at the back of the site was signicant. This included paintings for the new Tea Room.Talks and lecture series have been organised both in in the museum and at other venues with all profits given to the Friends.And dozens more: from the purchase of trees and shrubs for the garden at the back of the site to the purchase of a Papal bull..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Aontú selects human rights activist to run in Assembly election  ","story":"AONTUacute is fielding a candidate in South Down in the May Assembly election.The party has confirmed that Rosemary McGlone will be its standard bearer when voters go to the polls in  weeksrsquo time to elect five MLAs to represent the constituency.Aontuacute says it views South Down as a key constituency and aims to challenge the Stormont ldquoestablishment parties and provide genuine opposition to the to the broken Stormont system.A nationalist and human rights activist, Ms McGlone is a secondary school teacher in Belfast and a mother of four young children.Her party says that like many nationalists, she felt no longer represented by Sinn Fein or the SDLP and that rather than let herself be disenfranchised with no one to vote for, she has taken a step forward so that people like her might have a voice in Stormont.Aontuacute says that like so many, Rosemary has been ldquofrustrated by Nationalist parties who have abandoned their communities and supported discriminatory policies.It says the final straw for the South Down candidate came when Sinn Feacutein and SDLP MLAs voted for abortion up until birth for children with disabilities. Aontuacute says Rosemary also opposes the de-prioritisation funding of hundreds of local schools that is contained in the Integrated Education Bill.Her party leader, Peader Toacuteibiacuten, said , people are on housing waiting lists, , on hospital waiting lists for longer than a year, a quarter of a million people are in poverty and Sinn Fein and SDLP MLAs have voted for abortion right up until the birth of the child.He declared: ldquoThat the DUP has torn down Stormont in the middle of these very real human crisis is wrong and it must not be allowed to happen again.ldquoAontuacute is the only political party calling for the reform of the democratic institutions to prevent any one party tearing them down again or any one party preventing an Executive being formed in the future.ldquoThese le and death issues are too important for Stormont to be crashed over and over again. We are also calling for the suspension of MLA salaries for the political parties who crash the democratic institutions or prevent Executives being formed.Mr Aontuacute described Ms McGlone as a le-long human rights activist and nationalist who stopped voting for the SDLP because ldquoit abandoned her and so many communities to pursue identity politics.He continued: ldquoRosemary will lead the fight to give a voice to the tens of thousands of people who currently have no representation in Co Down. Stormont is broken and she will help lead the fight by Aontuacute to make the democratic institutions work.ldquoRosemary will also stand strong for the human right to le for everyone. She fully supports the integrated education sector but will fight for equality and parity of esteem in the education system, especially for rural schools and will oppose the Integrated Education Bill. All students mdash Catholic, Protestant and Integrated mdash should be treated equally. A vote for Rosemary is a vote for compassion and a vote to fix the broken system..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch lose out to UCD side  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH blew their chance to draw UCD into the relegation dogfight with a poor first half display into the wind on Saturday.There had been high hopes of a victory with a sizeable UCD contingent involved in the Ireland U- squad and the release of Ulsterrsquos Tom Stewart and Comac Izuchukwu to bolster the pack.However, the late withdrawal of the vastly experienced John Donnan meant a reshuffle with Tom Martin stepping in at lock and debutant Kyle Gill up to the bench.Playing into a gale in the first half, Ballynahinch failed to keep possession of the ball for long enough to exert any control on proceedings and were soon behind to a couple of excellently struck Chris Cosgrave penalties.The home side were denied a certain try when Stewart broke up the blindside and offloaded to a flying Conor McAuley but his foot was judged to be in touch.This proved to be signicant moment in the match as UCD scored a close range try from centre Dave Ryan soon afterwards to lead by  points with half an hour gone.Disaster was to strike for the home side on the stroke of half time when Ballynahinch found themselves pinned back from what should have been a comfortable position in the UCD half.They gave away a scrum penalty to concede territory but excellent defence forced a UCD knock-on and regained possession.Instead of playing narrow channels and reaching half-time no further in arrears, they were turned over in the middle of the field, allowing UCD to play an excellent kick behind a scrambling defence which then had to concede a goal lineout into a mph wind.The kick went straight out, handing the students a five-metre attacking scrum, and several phases later winger Ross Deegan scored. The conversion took UCD into a -point half time lead.The second half was dominated by Ballynahinch with the wind at their back and a big crowd roaring them on.Their maul was proving to be a real weapon and Kyle McCall was again the beneficiary with a try after  minutes after a superb maul.Tommy Donnan then had what seemed a certain try disallowed after another excellent maul, but when flanker Olly Loughead barged over on the hour mark to close the gap to eight points the home faithful could sense a famous win.However, UCD scored with their only attack of the second half through scrum half Richie Fahy to give the students some breathing space.Despite laying siege to the line, all the home side had to show for the last quarter was a penalty try with two minutes remaining and the students held on for victory and virtually assured their Division A status for -.Ballynahinch look destined for a nail-biting two-legged play-off against UCC to decide who goes down, but will hope to play themselves into better form over the final few weeks of the season.All support welcome at Garryowen this weekend.Ballynahinch : Nacho Cladera Crespo, Tom Stewart, Kyle McCall, Cormac Izuchukwu, Tom Martin, Tommy Donnan, Olly Loughead, Bradley Luney, Conor McAuley, Greg Hutley, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Rory Butler, Ronan Patterson, Conor Rankin, David Cooper, John Dickson, Kyle Gill, Gareth Gill, Ruari Meharg, Yasser Omar..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dougan goal cancels out Sam’s strike in derby  ","story":"THE local derby between Drumaness Mills and Killyleagh YC ended in a stalemate in quite horrendous conditions on Saturday.The Mills, who are currently on the back of a strong run of form and had won well at the reverse fixture a few weeks ago, would have been confident when welcoming old rivals Killyleagh for their Premier Division clash.The match at Meadowvale began at a high pace with lots of commitment shown by both sides in an effort to secure an early foothold in the game.In the early exchanges Rory Mason, Adam Keaney and then James McGivern all had half chances which they would have expected to have done better with.Somewhat against the run of play and with  minutes on the clock, Killyleaghrsquos Sam Carson rled the ball high into the top right hand corner of the net from the edge of the box with the home goalkeeper, Marc Reid, rooted to the spot. A fine goal at any level.Killyleagh were noticeably revitalised and buoyant following their goal, however, clever work from Callum Dougan on halfway sent Adam Kearney through in search of an equaliser with  minutes on the clock but he blazed over with the goal at his mercy.Killyleaghrsquos Conor Hamilton was becoming more and more influential in the game and continued to probe and prompt throughout, although he will be rueing his miss when he seemed better placed to score to put his side further ahead.On  minutes Rory Mason broke at pace and found Dougan, who forced a smart save from Aaron Carberry in the Killyleagh goal. Kearney, following up, trickled the rebound towards goal before it was hacked to safety before crossing the line.The Mills continued to press and a surging run down the right from Ben Campbell resulted in a fine ball across the face of goal but without anyone reacting it went out for a throw on the far side.Killyleagh had a corner in the th minute and in an example of the conditions, the now swirling wind took the ball directly out of play and with that the referee blew his whistle and brought the half to a close.Half-time: Drumaness Mills FC  Killyleagh YC .Clearly unimpressed with his sides first half showing, Drumaness manager, Mark Kerr, made two changes at half-time.

The part of the track closest to the residents will be some - metres away.But Shan Slieve Drive householders say that is too close. In their petition to planners they say that the nearest gardens to the track are just  metres away and  dwellings and two major residential homes for the elderly are within  metres of the site.ldquoThe noise generated by the use of the track is likely to be highly detrimental to residents over a wide area, they claim. ldquoSuch a track is likely to operate from Easter until the end of September at least at weekends and almost certainly daily from am until pm during July and August.

allocation of funds and thus enrich the educational experience offered to our pupils, said Mr Hanna.ldquoWhat was not said, of course, was that the Government had tired of the antics of the teaching

Land at the rear of Russell Park is not deemed a flooding risk.Late last year, politicians said they are keen to see a wide-ranging development plan for the town centre location and while they accept that it may not be possible to deliver everything that will be in the blueprint at the same time, they want to aim high and also target potential funders to finance what will be an ambitious project.Downpatrick area councillors met with senior council officials last week to discuss proposals for the development of the park with the focus on maximising the opportunities that Dunleath offers.It has been agreed that a paper detailing plans for the new skateboard park and pump track will be outlined at a forthcoming meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee.A working group has been set up to oversee the future of the park and its members have taken a close look at the existing sports pitches, with many keen to provide at least one G or G pitch which would provide a facility that could be used all year round.Downpatrick councillor, Oonagh Hanlon, described the development plans for Dunleath as ldquoexciting and praised the local authorityrsquos sensible approach to maximise its potential.She also conceded that while parts of the park present challenges as they are included within a flood plain, there is agreement aiming local politicians on the way forward.ldquoWe need to press ahead with what is achievable in the short term at Dunleath Park, whilst keeping an eye on a longer-term strategy.

The food serves as a stress reliever and in many cases initially the person is not aware of what they are doing.In this day and age of dieting, health and fitness, it is sometimes dficult to ascertain the dference between someone who has an eating disorder and a person who is simply weight conscious.The main ingredient present in a person with an eating disorder is the use or abuse of food to cope with dficult feelings, whereas a weight conscious person may simply want to lose weight for a wedding, an occasion, to fit into an outfit.It is the psychological and emotional implications that separate the weight conscious person from the person with an eating disorder. Unfortunately, some embarking on a weight loss trail start out innocently to lose lsquoa few poundsrsquo, however over a period of time a personrsquos brain and body chemistry can be affected by the diet they have chosen and as a result the brain and bodybecome impaired.Possible causesThere is no single cause for eating disorders, as there are many factors pertaining to them. The common thread seems to be a supersensitive nature, low self esteem and an inability to respond appropriately to uncomfortable feelings.The good news is recovery is possible and a person can restore their relationship with themselves and with food. All iniduals have their own unique personal issues that contribute to their eating disorder, so treatment has to be tailored to the iniduals specic needs, personality and lestyle.Who develops disorders Anyone can develop an eating disorder, regardless of age, sex cultural background, etc, and it is not unusual for an eating disorder to surface in middle age. Research suggests that there may also be a genetic disposition to eating disorders and a link to certain personality types.However, there are certain factors pertaining to eating disorders and anyone can develop a disordered pattern of eating. A traumatic event, disordered perception, being abused, being bullied, a long term illness, a death, negative influences from a family member or a friend can all have a part to play in the symphony that can create issues around food.What are the categories There are several categories of eating disorders. However the main culprits are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and other related disorders.These disorders centre around extreme or potentially dangerous eating and weight control behaviours which include binge eating, starving, purging, chewing and spitting and over exercising.There are two less known eating disorders mdash night eating syndrome and orthorexia nervosamdash as well as further categories under the title of EDNOS , but today Irsquod Like to explore the three most common types of eating disorder.AnorexiaThe first case of anorexia was in  in France and the first paper on anorexia was written by Sir William Gull in .Anorexia is the relentless pursuit of low body weight either by curtailing food intake or restricting particular foods thought to be fattening. This can result in emaciation and the risk of collapse or death.Some people exercise compulsively to burn off the lsquoperceivedrsquo excess of calories from the small amount theydo manage to eat. The focus based on food is an attempt to cope with control and to feel some sense of power in their lives.It is not about simply wishing to be slim like models in magazines. Starvation causes the disorder to take control and this alters brain and body chemistry that results in further distortions, in thinking and emotional reasoning. As the illness takes more of a hold, a person starts to become exhausted as their energy levels are compromised due to lack of nutrition. This, together with an increase in negative energy, may account for the heaviness they feel.In all cases this heaviness is mistaken for fatness, hence they engage in a constant struggle to keep losing weight. It is a war on food that must be maintained despite the already severe weight loss that the person has incurred.Anorexia checklist:Weight loss in a short space of timeLoss of periods for womenFeeling cold all the timeDizzinessDry, rough, pale discoloured skinSevere restriction of foodFood rituals, such as chopping food into small pieces, counting bits of foodBloated stomach Loss of bone massMood swingsPerfectionistic attitudesInsecuritySelf-worth becomes based on what is eaten or not eatenIntense fear of gaining weightDistorted perception of body shape, weight, personality and amount of food eatenRigid and obsessive behaviourWearing baggy clothesAvoiding companyIn some cases some take laxativesBuzz from starving ndash sense of power or worthConviction that they are OK despite concerns of otherAs you can see, the above have far reaching effects on a personrsquos health and well-being, and as suchleft untreated can be fatal.The long term effects can lead to women becoming infertile or have dficulty getting pregnant. There is also a high risk of developing osteoporosis for both men and women.BulimiaThe term Bulimia nervosa literally means lsquoox hunger of nervous originrsquo. This hunger is driven by an emotional need that food cannot alone fill. Usually this person feels this void or gap or emptiness and they seek to use food to fill it. Unfortunately, as many find out, the emptiness cannot be filled by food, as it is emotional, physical and spiritual.Sufferers characteristically binge eat or over eat and end up feeling bloated, worse, too full. After their eating episode they then vomit and or take laxatives in a bid to prevent themselves from gaining weight. Others also over exercise in a bid to burn unwanted calories. As with anorexia, control and the abuse of food to cope are also present.Bulimia usually follows dieting and starts later than anorexia mdash in late adolescence. It may follow anorexia. It can continue for many yearsleft untreated, thus many older women have the illness. The period after childbirth is another time when women are at risk.Bulimia is also associated with low self esteem, lack of confidence and over-evaluation of weight and shape, and a need to control weight. Bulimic behaviour is very addictive as, while vomiting and exercising the brain releases endorphins, chemicals which are the bodyrsquos natural pain killers.The ritual confers a sense of emotional release, so what starts off as a way of controlling calories, becomes a way of getting this emotional release ndash which will be repeated whenever a person feels emotional or physical stress.Bulimia checklist:Frequent weight changes.Sore throat, swollen glands, tooth decay, bad breath.Preoccupation with an overestimation of body shape and weight.VomitingLaxative abuseRigid and harsh exercise regimesFear of putting on weightDepressionMood swingsElectrolyte and fluid imbalancesPoor skin condition and hair lossLethargy and tirednessHeart palpitationsInternal organs damageUncontrollable urges to eat vast amounts of foodAnxiety, guilt and shame attached to self and behaviourFeelings of isolationBuzz from vomiting, sense of release reliefBuzz from perceived weight lossEasy weight gain.Again, like anorexia, the above can have a far reaching effect on mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well being. In extreme cases bulimia causes heart failure because when a person induces vomiting, they lose potassium from the body.Potassium is a mineral which regulates the sdrenal glands, the nervous system, the heart and energy levels of the body. The adrenal glands in the body are responsible for handling stress effectively. Other dangers include rupture of the stomach, choking, drying up of saliy glands.Binge eatingLike bulimia, binge eating disorder has only recently been recognised as a distinct condition. It was in  that it was first acknowledged as an eating disorder in its own right.BED is very similar to bulimia in all respects, except that the person does not purge to dispose of unwanted calories. It is believed that there are more people suffering from BED than anorexia or bulimia.People who binge or overeat and who do not purge usually struggle with their weight, although not all are overweight. Being overweight , of course brings with it the risk of a host of other physical illnesses and most sufferers feel depressed, out of control and ashamed of their behaviour.Binge eating checklist:Binging in secretEating very rapidlyEmotional eatingCanrsquot stop when had enoughSensing the eating behaviour is not normalEating despite feeling very fullsometimesFeeling out of control when eatingShame, depression, guiltCompulsive eating when not hungryFantasies about being a better person when thin.As many people with weight issues are judged by society, a supportive and nurturing environment is necessary in order for the inidual to feel safe. Here again, education is a vital component of recovery from any eating disorder. Therapeutic interventions work at both physical and emotional levels to deal with the urges, cravings, to change eating habits, look at thought patterns and rules, becoming more emotionally resilient. Ultimately treatment is available that helps each inidual become empowered, recover and move forward with their lives.If you have any queries or would like to arrange an appointment please call   or email empower@post www.empowercounsellingni.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Top dancer Anna qualifies for World Championships  ","story":"LOCAL Irish dancers have proven themselves to be a step above the rest once again.Members of the Crossgar-based Scoil Rince an Chroiacute dance school enjoyed plenty of success at the Kelly Hendry Feis in Newcastle upon Tyne and the Mid-Ulster Grades Feis in Dungannon.Thirty-five dancers from the school took to the stage at both locations with dancers excelling in both the grades system and championships.The school ed home with  first places,  top five places and a host of trophies and sashes.The schoolrsquos success comes of the back of a very successful Ulster Championships in Ballybofey in October.Anna McGlew qualied for the World Championships to be held in Belfast at Easter and Sean Gordon achieved fth place, reaching a podium place at his first Ulsters, having only started to compete four months prior.Teacher Briacuted McKinney said: ldquoWhilst acknowledging the ious pandemic-related challenges brought to us in  and early this year, the great class spirit and support for each other helped drive our ious success both last year and this year to date.Co-teacher Maura Davidson commented: ldquoThe results are down to the commitment, dedication and support from our dancers and families.The school now prepares for their first championship feis in Downpatrick later this month and the World Championships at Easter.Classes continue weekly at the studio in Crossgar.

It is a book that every Christian should read especially those who are full time in the Lord’s service. As Bonar’s inspirational ‘Banner of Truth’ publication states on the dust cover of the  edition: “His diary and le is one of the great treasures left to the Church from the th century, and deserves to be widely and eagerly read”.On April , , Andrew Bonar made this entry: “Spared to see my th year, while others are taken”. The reason that he wrote those words was because so many of his friends and family had been taken away in death while they were still very young.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Just consider the following examples: three of his siblings died in infancy his father died when Andrew was just eleven his own son also called Andrew died as a young child his dear we Isabella passed away in middle age, and his very good Scottish ministerial friend the Rev Robert Murray McCheyne had died before he reached his thirtieth birthday, a fact that Bolnar reflected upon regularly for many subsequent years.As Bonar thought of the lives of others coming to an end so swtly, he pondered carefully and seriously the question - “Why am I spared  What is the reason that I am not taken away ” The diary reveals that he meditated upon that question on more than one occasion. It is a question that I have been caused to consider earnestly myself in recent days and you would be wise to consider it also. Ask yourself just now: “Why am I spared and others taken ” Why has God allowed you to live so long – when he has taken away some of your friends and loved ones in the prime of le  If you are a believer then there is only one answer to that question. The Lord has kept you alive , not so that you can make more money or make a name for yourself, but because your work for Him is not yet finished.There is still a work for you to do for Christ. The first time American acclaimed evangelist D. L. Moody met fellow US evangelist R. A. Torrey he said to him: “Young man you had better get to work for the Lord”. That is still the Lord’s message for you today. He would say: “Go work today in my vineyard’” . Get busy for the Lord while you still have the opportunity.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Prior to being in Lurgan, the organisation’s administrative base was located in Dublin and Belfast.The Royal Black moved out of Brownlow House in  to temporary premises in Loughgall, beside the Museum of Orange Heritage at Sloan’s House.Now, the institution is looking forward to taking up residence in their own purpose-built administrative centre.“The opening of our new headquarters will be a landmark day in the history of the Royal Black Institution,” said Rev Anderson.“This project has been one of the biggest and most important ever undertaken by the Imperial Grand Black Chapter of the British Commonwealth.“The need for our own headquarters was discussed and agreed in , we purchased the Loughgall building in , renovation work began in May , and I’m delighted to say we’re ready to cut the ribbon on Saturday, April .“It has been a long road to get to this point, and there have been many challenges along the way. “We had originally hoped to open the building in , so that the unveiling would form part of our celebrations for the centenary of Northern Ireland. However, the Covid pandemic wreaked havoc with our work schedule. But we were fairly relaxed about the delay as our focus was always about completing the building to a high standard rather than rushing to a completion date.“There are so many people to thank for all their hard work but I would like to take this opportunity to pay special tribute to the contractors, Weir Bros Construction, for their professionalism and attention to detail, and to our own clerk of works, Edgar Patterson, and quantity surveyor, Keith Anderson, and the entire Royal Black HQ project team, for their passion, commitment and expertise over the last few years.“Thanks to the efforts of everyone involved, we now have modern headquarters from which we can proudly maintain our stand for the Reformed Faith and strengthen our Christian and charitable outreach.”The building itself has an interesting history. At one stage it was a public house known as the Rock Tavern. Afterwards, a temperance advocate, Cecilia Cope, turned it into a coffee house. A later inhabitant was Field Marshal Sir Gerald Templer, a senior British Army officer and former chief of the Imperial General Staff, who fought in both world wars. In more recent times it housed a popular antiques business.The grand opening will also include the opening of a ‘Leaders’ Legacy’ exhibition on the lives of past sovereign grand masters, and the unveiling and dedication of a bust of Sir Norman Stronge.

They were quite humorous, talking about not stealing, but borrowing, a pony and taking it for a ride, it was probably quite normal back then.”Isaac continued: “When he passed away, I took the recordings and combined them with music and sound design and put it into a small personalised wooden box to give to my mum as a gt. “She had no idea that I had done any of this, and her reaction was an indication of the enormous potential that personalised listening experiences could offer to family members and patients in a similar situation. That’s when I had the idea for the ‘From My Perspective’ project.” Isaac is studying a PhD looking at ‘Creative Arts for Palliative Care’ based at the Sonic Arts Research Centre, a project which involves recording interviews with day hospice patients. He said: “The main hospice I was working at was Marie Curie, I was able to do this with  participants over the summer, it was a great experience.“I combine elements of their voice, music, and sound design into a memory box which can then be played back through the device’s in-built speakers.“My aim was for the recording to last around  minutes to an hour, so I’d maybe record up to two hours and I’d edit it down to the best bits and cut out the bits where I was talking. I’d also give them the option to have the full unedited version.“Some patients want to use this as an opportunity to leave an advance directive regarding personal matters, whereas others wanted to use it as an opportunity to leave a memento that can be shared amongst family and used to help facilitate communication and shared experiences. “My hope for this project is that someday it could be implemented as a full-time service within hospices around the world.” Isaac’s work will be showcased at Belfast Imagine Festival in conjunction with Marie Curie Hospice on March .Annahilt  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular‘Major rally’ details announced as unionists voice regret at Sinn Fein anonymity rulingSinn Fein man behind major Brexit Protocol legal challege will remain anonymous, court rulesCounter-terror squad raids the home of dissident republican figure because of alleged benefit fraudPSNI arrest man after reports of woman in distress War in Ukraine: The best hope for humanity is that President Putin’s generals oust him, says Colonel Tim CollinsMost PopularBest pancake pans UK : from non-stick to cast iron, these pans will produce perfect pancakes every timeBest Aldi dupes : top perfume, skincare, beauty, makeup, cleansing balm products from Lacura to le CreusetBest wetsuits for women  UK: surf or open-water swim with wetsuits from Decathlon, Billabong, RoxyBest women’s walking trousers for hiking : hiking trousers reviewed, from Arc-Teryx, Jack Wolfskin, Acai                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions.

CCR says it is committing £. million to the project in total, which includes the purchase price.The other £. million will be spent on \"demolition, remediation, and re-development\".The contracts have now been exchanged between Cardf Capital Region and energy giant RWE, the seller. The distinctive Aberthaw Power Station as seen from the air. Photo: Siriol Grfiths The Cardf Capital Region have released a proposed \"master plan\" for the redevelopment of the site, which they say \"will take several years to come to fruition given the nature of and complexities involved in the transitioning process\".In sum, CCR says it will:Support the production of renewable and green energy projectsProvide an accompanying battery storage facility to support the green energy projectsProduce a zero-carbon manufacturing cluster which will include green hydrogen production facilitiesProvide a green energy innovation centre to promote innovation, growth, knowledge and community interaction with the zero-carbon future of WalesBe responsible for the development and maintenance of a bio-erse ecology park which will include a visitor centre, providing amenities to the local communityCreate the correct conditions to support industrial de-carbonisation and future giga-plant facilities.Cardf Capital Region also says the project has \"the potential to create thousands of direct, indirect and induced jobs, along with local supply chain and upskilling benefits\", though no further details were supplied as to what that means in practical terms. An artists impression of the Aberthaw Power Station site created by London real estate giant, Reef Group for Cardf Capital Region The master plan of the site produced by London real estate giant Reef Group on behalf of Cardf Capital Region The CCR goes on to say that it will \"maintain a strong commitment to engage and involve local community stakeholders in order to develop an open, inclusive and participative ethos as soon as the commercially sensitive considerations have been addressed.\"There are areas of the site which require ongoing custodianship, in respect of nature, bioersity and managing the overall ecology of the site, which will be best achieved in partnership with community.\"The Aberthaw nature reserve. The lagoon is where the ancient Aberthaw harbour was situated before it was destroyed to make way for the power station. Photo: Siriol Grfiths The group also says that its redevelopment plan will \"commit to safeguarding and developing the Nature Reserve, working with colleagues in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to ensure effective plans are put in place. In the interim, whilst plans are worked through, commitment is given to ensure this ecologically valuable component of the site is protected and, wherever possible, further enhanced and augmented\".However, Cardf Capital Region, despite promising to work with local residents in the future, stops short of making specic reference to concerns raised by members of the nearby community recently. Those concerns centre around what will happen to the  metre high pulverised ash mound, the sea wall being breached by the tide, and problems with traffic due to poor local transport infrastructure. The long Aberthaw Power Station ash mound, m high. The smoke stack can be seen in the background. Photo: Siriol Grfiths \"Well believe these plans when we see them,\" Paul Turner told The National. He has been living in the shadow of the power station since  and says that since then, he and his we Sara have seen many ideas come and go, including nuclear power and tidal energy. \"Everybody who lives near that site knows how toxic it is. The ash tip is full of asbestos from when they demolished the original A power station. And the site gets flooded whenever theres a spring tide or a storm, ask anyone who has worked there. Thatll only get worse as the years go by.\"Will £ million keep the tide from drowning that site  Id say RWE are laughing all the way to the bank.\"The Climate Central Coastal Risk Screening Tool predicts that the site will be under water by , with flooding reaching as far inland as St Hilarys There are similar concerns from Barry Town Councillor, Dennis Clarke: \"The ambition for the Vale to access clean, green, high value employment is commendable but this site could not be sold to private industry. The likely reason the site was regarded as unsaleable might be the cost of dealing with tidal flooding, clearing the signicant level of contamination, removing the slag heap, identied as dangerous by RWE.\"Its well known that the road access is completely insufficient, especially bearing in mind the Vale and the Welsh Government persist in supporting a too large, unviable development at Model Farm\"I hope the CCR releases the papers that will show why they believe this site is suitable for any development beyond reinstating what was in place before the power station was built.\"A map produced by London real estate giant Reef Group in  depicting so-called major assets nearbyIn its statement, the CCR describes the Aberthaw site as having \"strong strategic links with other major assets, including Bro Tathan Business Park, Cardf Airport, and the overarching St Athan Enterprise Zone – one of the few sites in the UK capable of accommodating large-scale lithium-ion battery production\".Last month, the Welsh Government was accused of having let a proposed gigafactory project at St Athan \"slip throughfingers\" by Welsh Conservative South Wales Central MS Andrew RT Davies. It followed an announcement by car battery manufacturer, Britishvolt, that it was creating a factory in Northumberland, whereas St Athan had been its original preferred location. March  : Aberthaw Power Station as photographed from the Wales Coast Path. The site is currently badly flooded in the wake of recent storms and spring tides. Photo: Siriol Grfiths CCRs plans make no specic reference to tidal energy at Aberthaw either, despite the group having earmarked the site as being \"perfect for that type of facility\" last summer. By October , it was also reported that a new commission was being set up to explore building a barrage across the Severn estuary for tidal energy CCR is a part of that commission. However, a statement supplied by Welsh Government Economy Minister, Vaughan Gething, does moot the possibility of tidal energy: \"The proposed plan for Aberthaw is positive news which fits well with our commitment to develop tidal lagoon projects and support ideas that can help Wales become a world centre for emerging tidal technologies\".Mr Gethings enthusiasm is echoed by the UK governments Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, David TC Davies, who is the Conservative MP for Monmouth: \"The UK Government’s investment in the Cardf Capital Region will deliver thousands of jobs at Aberthaw and help put Wales on course for an economic recovery from the pandemic.\"The current s of the Cardf Capital Region - including any activity at Aberthaw - will eventually move into the new South East Wales Corporate Joint Committee .Three other Corporate Joint Committees will cover the rest of Wales in the south-west, the north, and the central area of the country.This article originally appeared on our sister site The National. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I can’t wait to hear what the children think of it.“This new school building will provide a modern teaching and learning environment for staff and pupils, as well as a range of facilities for the local community.”The design includes solar  with battery storage, an air source heat pump, electric vehicle charging points, storage space for bicycles and scooters, and green habitat areas.Contractors ISG began building the school in January last year, which forms part of the council’s wider £ million programme of new school buildings across the Vale.Cllr Burnett added: “The council has made a climate commitment through our Project Zero initiative, which aims to make the organisation carbon neutral by . Delivering schools like this, which are extremely environmentally friendly, is a key part of that pledge.“This is the latest project in our Sustainable Communities for Learning programme, a far-reaching body of work intended to transform educational facilities across the Vale.”Protests were sparked by the decision to relocate Llancarfan Primary School from its village setting five miles down the road to Rhoose, with some parents opposing what they saw as the closure of a rural school. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This will include a regular annual vacination programme, the Welsh Government has said.: Three Covid deaths reported in Wales - more than  new cases in Gwent.It comes as Mr Drakeford has said that Wales will remain at alert level zero for the next three weeks, with no further changes to Covid regulations planned before March .Then, all legal measures could be removed, should the public health situation remain stable, the first minister said.“We’ve been living in the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic for two long years,” he said. “It has touched all our lives – across Wales, families and communities have made many sacrices to keep themselves and their loved ones safe. People in Wales have followed the rules.“But sadly, too many families have experienced the pain of losing a loved one or a close friend.

This will include a regular annual vacination programme, the Welsh Government has said.: Three Covid deaths reported in Wales - more than  new cases in Gwent.It comes as Mr Drakeford has said that Wales will remain at alert level zero for the next three weeks, with no further changes to Covid regulations planned before March .Then, all legal measures could be removed, should the public health situation remain stable, the first minister said.“We’ve been living in the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic for two long years,” he said. “It has touched all our lives – across Wales, families and communities have made many sacrices to keep themselves and their loved ones safe.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityFlammable cladding was found on Lydstep Flats in Llandaff North in March , following concerns about fire safety in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire.Cardf council removed the cladding in December later that year, leaving residents suffering from cold flats, poor insulation and black mould.Now contractors ISG have started to replace that cladding, with the work expected to last until summer next year.Councillor Lynda Thorne, cabinet member for housing and communities, said: “I’m so glad, as I know all the Lydstep residents are, that contractors are now on site to begin replacing the cladding that was removed because it didn’t meet current fire safety standards.“The cladding we’re using to overclad the three blocks is of the highest level of fire safety.”The work includes new windows and upgrading balconies for the  flats. Meanwhile, residents in council flats in Butetown are still waiting for contractors to begin installing replacement cladding, with no start date announced yet.Flats at Loudon House and Nelson House in Butetown were also found to have flammable cladding in the wake of the Grenfell fire.Delays to both the council flats in Llandaff North and Butetown were due to inflation caused by Brexit and the pandemic, according to the council, as well as changes to the safety testing rules for new cladding. The estimated cost of replacing cladding at Lydstep doubled from £. million to £ million.Cllr Thorne added: “Progress on this work has been affected by signicant cost rises due to Brexit and inflationary pressures in the building industry, as well as the impact of the extensive testing and regulation framework for cladding solutions.“Throughout this time, we have been so grateful to the residents for their patience as we worked on finding the right solution for the three blocks, and it’s great to see contractors on site and work underway.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe app would let users know real-time data on public transport and the road network, and the estimated time to get somewhere by car, train, bus or bike.A huge upgrade in traffic monitoring, new bus lanes, and a state-of-the-art new traffic control room also form part of Cardf council’s plans for an ‘intelligent transport system’.Buses could also be ordered like taxis, taking a route based on the demand for the service determined by public requests.The council will consult the public on its plans to roll out the changes for the system, which it hopes will encourage people to walk, cycle or take public transport.Cllr Caro Wild, cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said: “We want to ask the public their views on our draft strategy to build an intelligent transport system in Cardf. We do have systems in place already, but they are not integrated, and many are coming to the end of their le, as they have been superseded by newer technology.“We want to reduce harmful emissions, improve air quality and make Cardf a healthier city to live and work in. One of the best ways to do that is to change the way we move around the city, encouraging public transport, cycling and walking as preferred ways of getting around.“By , we would like to see % of all journeys made by sustainable forms of transport. To do that we will need to double the number of people travelling by bike or by bus. To achieve this, we need better infrastructure which is managed by an integrated, intelligent transport system.“It would act as the nerve centre ensuring bus corridors, cycleways and improved pedestrian crossings and pavements are recognised as a key part of the network, and helping to make travel on Cardf’s roads as efficient as possible.”One goal in the new policy is integrated ticketing, which would see people taking public transport be able to use the same ticket for a train and a bus, similar to in London..removeA new traffic control centre would be built for council staff, emergency services, bus and train companies, and enforcement officers. The new control centre would help monitor traffic across the city, respond to incidents quicker, reducing congestion.The A will pilot a ‘smart corridor’ scheme with buses given priority over cars. If successful, these could be rolled out on other main roads in Cardf.A public consultation on the intelligent transport system is expected to take place in summer, before getting signed off by the cabinet in autumn.Cllr Wild added: “Through the development of the transport user app, integrated ticketing and smart technology, residents and commuters will be better informed, so they themselves can make informed decisions on the best way to travel on any given day at any given time.“Our draft strategy looks at the use of data and technology to reduce congestion, incentivise active travel to make our highway network more efficient, and will help deal with incidents on the highway more effectively.“The opening of the bus station in  will act as a trigger point to implement new services and technology, so it is important that we do this work now.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Three points at the end is all that matters and we’re really happy about it.”If the Magpies’ current trajectory is upward, the Seagulls find themselves in something of a lull after a fourth defeat on the trot, although head coach Graham Potter was pleased with much of what he saw on Tyneside..removeHe said: “It’s four defeats for us and prior to that, we hadn’t lost too many in the season, so that’s how the league can turn quickly.“Before that, we were on the back of an unbeaten club record in the highest league, so it is what it is.“There were lots of positives in terms of the performance – it’s a big improvement from the last couple of games we’ve had.“The boys are suffering a bit and of course we’re suffering a bit in terms of results, but we’ll learn from this and get better for it.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Fabian Schar not getting carried away by Newcastle revival article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I’m very happy, pleased to be back playing  minutes because it’s been a long time but it went very well.“Thomasasked meI felt OK to play  minutes and I said for me that’s no problem. I feel good, I’ve been training very hard and been part of the team for a few weeks, getting used to the system they have here of how we want to play.“It gets easier every day and playing a full game obviously helps. Personally for me it has been about getting back to full fitness and being able to play football at the top level again, then let’s see where that takes me.“Obviously, I am here to help Brentford to stay up and get my own football career back on track.”Frank insisted after Ivan Toney’s hat-trick inspired a first league win in nine attempts that Eriksen could realistically play every game between now and the end of the season.The class of the -year-old was evident early on in Norfolk, with trademark long-range passes from both feet before his fine nd-minute delivery from a corner created Toney’s opener.“I wouldn’t say it was a new chapter, it is just my le continuing,” Eriksen reflected after his first competitive start in close to nine months.“Of course I have had a bit of a setback, it has taken a few months, but it has been about getting my family really back together and being back to being a normal family again..remove“Being here now, eight or nine months later, it is incredible.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt has been an injury-plagued campaign for Bamford, who has made just six Premier League appearances this season, the last of them on December , as ankle and hip issues were followed by a problem at the bottom of his foot.He was an unused substitute in Saturday’s - defeat at Leicester, where his presence was sorely missed as Leeds lacked a cutting edge, having  shots at goal but failing to breach the inspired Kasper Schmeichel’s net.But new Leeds head coach Marsch, whose side lie just two points above the relegation zone, expects Bamford to get some game time, albeit not from the off, when they look to boost their bid for top-flight survival against Villa.“I don’t think Patrick’s ready to be on from the start,” the American said. “Let’s see how the week goes but certainly I think he’ll be ready to put in some minutes come Thursday.“Patrick is back in training, he will continue to progress more and more, we’ll get him fitter and fitter and sharper and sharper and then we will be able to rely on him in these  games.”Marsch insisted Bamford would only have been available for  minutes at best at Leicester so elected to use the last of his three changes to send on Tyler Roberts with a quarter of an hour to go in a bid to get an equaliser.Leeds were dominant for large spells but missed a string of chances, with  Schmeichel excellently denying Rodrigo and Raphinha in particular, before falling behind when Harvey Barnes coolly slotted home after  minutes.Rather than introduce Bamford, Leeds’ -goal top-scorer last season, Marsch turned to Roberts, who tweaked his hamstring as he extended himself to challenge Daniel Amartey, with the Welshman now a doubt for the Villa game.“Patrick was maximum  minutes, so obviously we want to get him on the pitch as quickly as we possibly can but I felt we needed to make a change before that -minute mark,” Marsch added..remove“Then of course we put Tyler on the pitch and it leads to him having a weird collision inside the box and him having a little bit of a hamstring strain and then we’re almost playing a man down for the last phase.“We’ll see exactly what’s going on with Tyler.”Barnes has scored in every Premier League game he has played against Leeds, taking his tally to four from four, after curling beyond Illan Meslier midway through the second half following a neat one-two with Kelechi Iheanacho.“I’ve got a good record against, them, haven’t I,” Barnes told LCFC TV. “I don’t know what it is, whether it’s the style of play that they have, or just they’re my lucky team.“I keep managing to score against them and long may that continue. The goal came at a good time for us.
