Now Ackerman, one of the most acclaimed science writers in the US, is back with another book about birds, one that delves deeper into the wonders and peculiarities of the avian world, seeking to explode the conventional idea that, as the opening of the book puts it, “there is the bird way, and there is the mammal way”. This book is a celebration of the dizzying variety of bird life and behaviour, one that will enthral birders and non-birders alike.The recent vogue for books about birds – started by Helen Macdonald’s H Is for Hawk and continued by Birkhead as well as in memorable titles by Adam Nicolson, Tim Dee and Ackerman herself – seems to have been mirrored by an avian turn in scientific research. Despite there being only four years between The Bird Way and its predecessor, it feels like a revolution has taken place in our understanding of birds in that time. The science here is hard, compelling and presented in Ackerman’s engaging and jargon-free prose, and on every page there is evidence to support the book’s thesis: that to speak of birds en masse is to make a category error, one that blinds us to the extraordinary variance in behaviour, appearance and even biology in these creatures we attempt to trap under the same ontological net. As American naturalist EO Wilson said: “Once you have seen one bird, you have not seen them all.”The book is arranged according to different aspects of bird behaviour. It begins with birdsong, moving from the dawn chorus to alarm calls to mimicry then there’s a series of chapters on “work” – how birds go about providing for themselves and their offspring. After this comes “play”, perhaps the most remarkable section in the book, where Ackerman looks at “one of the most playful animals on the planet”, the raven, in a way that means you’ll never be able to read Edgar Allan Poe again without laughing.Ackerman’s life appears to be a continent-hopping succession of astonishing encounters with birds, and there’s something powerful in a book that never feels tied to any one place, moving easily from the cave-dwelling oilbirds of north-eastern Venezuela to the keas of New Zealand to the honeyguides of Mozambique. The chain that links these birds is Ackerman’s deep interest in their behaviour and the way it adheres to the thesis of her book. It’s clear that there’s a virtuous circle at work in the scientific study of birds, so that the more we learn about them, the more we recognise the oversimplification and errors of our previous assumptions, the strange and remarkable otherness of life seen through a bird’s eye view. The Bird Way crystallises and threads together these revelations into a book full of wonders large and small.•\u0026nbsp The Bird Way: A New Look at How Birds Talk, Work, Play, Parent and Eat by Jennifer Ackerman is published by Corsair (£14.99).

But the risk to children’s wellbeing from keeping them at home is greater than the risk of being in class“A massive catch-up operation,” Boris Johnson said. Whatever he meant is due to be announced this week for the nine million children who are on course to lose getting on for half a year’s schooling. Will it be another fatuous over-promise? Something enormous is needed to repair the damage.The cabinet is tussling over relaxing social distancing to 1 metre. If earning public trust is key to opening up, those pushing for the cut are unlikely to reassure a nervous public. They are not pleading the cause of children, but agitating for pubs and restaurants. In the difficult decisions to ease the lockdown rules, estate agents, car showrooms, house cleaners, nannies, zoos and shops came first.The children’s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, is calling loudly for schools to fully open now, and for a children’s catch-up plan lasting a year, with a generous pupil premium. Closure, she says, denies the fundamental right to education.Longfield has been vocal about all that has been stripped from children in the past decade: as a founder of some of the best children’s centres, she was distraught at their destruction. She once took me to her Braintree Sure Start, back in New Labour’s heyday, proud of its remarkable nursery and family hub, with every professional help on hand, its cafe run by young people with disabilities, and a youth unit for excluded children. “Most centres have gone, or have very little left going on,” she says.These decisions are fiendish: politicians weigh up the risk of disease versus the certainty of personal, economic and social calamities. But taking cautious steps, schools are not only the most important places to open, but one of the safer places. Children are at very low risk from coronavirus. And, according to studies in seven countries, teachers are at the same risk as the general population.David Spiegelhalter is the Winton professor of public understanding of risk at Cambridge University. His discipline needs close public attention. Most of us are bad at assessing risk, irrationally fearing the wrong things, gambling on faulty perceptions, emotionally swayed. In the great miasma of facts, factoids and misinformation, with serious scientists disagreeing, how are parents to weigh up the odds? No wonder most have opted to keep children at home.At first people trusted government instruction. But no longer. Johnson and his ministers’ dishonesty with figures – they were even rebuked by the chief statistician – has left people all at sea. Testing and contact tracing, crucial to opening up, have been badly undermined by excessive boasts and lies about targets. But, for all the blunders, things are improving. The risk to children’s wellbeing from keeping schools shut looks far greater than the risk of opening the gates.What has Gavin Williamson’s education department been doing these 12 long weeks? The simplest tasks are beyond its grasp, failing to send free school meals vouchers, leaving families hungry for weeks. Despite a grand announcement it has still failed to get laptops to 200,000 children lacking them, exposing years of exclusion when so much homework requires the internet.“We’ve had no laptops, not one,” says Nicola Noble, co-head of Surrey Square primary in south London’s Aylesbury estate: she’s relying on donations. She has desperate parents and children standing outside school using its wifi, as they can’t afford data. A quarter of the school’s families have no internet.“But we’ve had 90-page Department for Education guidances that essentially leave all responsibility to us. Nothing useful,” she says. Noble had to spend hours Googling for a risk assessment process for staff and students, and days working out a wellbeing survey for the children, because it was not provided centrally. “They only told us their definition of vulnerable and key worker the night before admitting those children,” so they had to call all parents to ask what job they did, and everywhere only a fraction of the vulnerable children were actually sent to school. “They said 180 of our 500 children with social workers were vulnerable, but we’ve found it’s 243. We call every child every week, which should be guidance, but it’s not. They sent no script to help teachers talk to children about coronavirus: it took us hours, now dozens of schools use ours.”Food and wellbeing have preoccupied her staff, as many families have “no recourse to public funds”, left penniless once they lost their jobs. The school delivers food parcels to 128 families.Waiting for Johnson’s “big summer of catch-up”, she is ready to open up fully as soon as possible. “We could do anything – and we can’t close for summer holidays.” But schools are barred from going a penny over budget. “Just give us the money to hire spaces and support staff. Let us give out free breakfasts and lunches. Our children need to be back here.” As for distancing, she’ll try, but “frankly, they won’t”. That’s the honest risk, but one she wants to take.Yet again, why so late in the day? Why so little thought or planning? There has been no consultation with schools, nor with the children’s commissioner. Longfield wrote to the chancellor last week: “If we can have business recovery plans, we need a children’s recovery plan. But no money has been put forward.”Whatever this government’s ideological deformities, what continues to astonish is its staggering lack of ability to deliver anything, to learn from its mistakes – or to just plain govern.The decision for parents to make about sending their children back to schools was always going to be hard. But this government has made it doubly difficult."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ea6178ec48ae9413685ee5cc1aac108a950007c/0_120_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4af432c98a959a5eac93e7ee5d824cfb","title":"2m children in uk have done almost no school work in lockdown","story":"Two separate studies raise fears that millions of children, particularly in state schools, have done almost no work at allFour in 10 pupils in England are not in regular contact with their teachers, a study has found, amid mounting evidence of wide disparities in the provision of schoolwork during lockdown and fears that millions of children are doing little or nothing at all.Prof Francis Green, the study’s lead author, said its findings painted a gloomy picture of lost schooling and low amounts of schoolwork at home. “The closure of schools, and their only partial reopening, constitute a potential threat to the educational development of a generation of children.“Everyone is losing out in this generation, some much more than others. Better home schoolwork provision, and better still an early, safe return to school for as many as possible, should now become a top priority for government.”The UCL research also shines light on the huge gap in provision between pupils in private education and those in the state sector during lockdown, with private school pupils found to be five times more likely to get near full-time teaching online as those in the state sector.NFER chief executive Carole Willis said: “There are considerable differences in the levels of pupil engagement in remote learning, particularly amongst the most disadvantaged pupils. This supports a growing evidence base highlighting the risk of the attainment gap widening as a result of this pandemic. There is a pressing need for a comprehensive and long-term plan to address this issue.”“The private schools’ spending per pupil – at least three times those of state schools – enable them to gain better academic grades in normal times,” said Green. “Their resources and parental pressure have ensured that many more private schools have delivered a proper home schooling alternative.”The UCL findings, published by the LLAKES Centre for Research on Learning and Life Chances, are based on data collected in the last two weeks of April from a survey covering more than 4,500 children aged five and upwards from households across the UK. The findings came as secondary school pupils who are due to sit exams next summer began to return to class on Monday for some face-to-face time ahead of the summer holiday, with school leaders reporting high levels of attendance.Meanwhile, the government published new guidance allowing schools to invite more secondary school pupils for a one-off meeting ahead of the end of term and greater flexibility to primary schools to admit more pupils from additional year groups if they can do so safely.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We will do whatever we can to make sure no child, whatever their background, falls behind as a result of coronavirus.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28c0617c527e51d7f0f034760c4342005acae72e/0_179_4865_2920/master/4865.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db8bfe5a7b50458b8c34b1c157742606","title":"coronavirus uk has legal duty to review air pollution targets say lawyers","story":"Letter cites growing evidence of link between dirty air and Covid-19 infections and deathsGrowing evidence of a link between air pollution and the impact of coronavirus means the government has a legal obligation to urgently review its air quality strategy, according to lawyers.Dirty air is estimated to cause 40,000 early deaths a year in the UK, and evidence is mounting that it is linked to increased Covid-19 infection rates and death rates. The lawyers, acting for Mums for Lungs and the Good Law Project, say this potential risk to life means ministers must act even if the evidence is not yet conclusive.The letter adds to pressure on the government from 90 parliamentarians who on Friday backed action on air pollution to help avoid a second coronavirus peak. Meanwhile, a new air pollution inquiry by MPs on the environment, food and rural affairs select committee will examine delays in the rollout of clean air zones in cities as a result of the pandemic.The failure to consider air pollution as a factor in the higher rates of coronavirus deaths among minority ethnic groups was recently called “astonishing” and “wholly irresponsible” by critics of a Public Health England review.Jolyon Maugham, the director of the Good Law Project, said: “When there is a risk of harm to human life, the government must take measures to alleviate that risk. With evidence piling up that links dirty air with cases of Covid-19, it is the government’s legal duty to conduct an urgent review. The government says they are listening to science. They must prove it.”Jemima Hartshorn, from the campaign group Mums for Lungs, said: “Air pollution is linked to cancer, respiratory illnesses, stunted lung growth, diabetes, cardiac diseases, strokes and many other diseases. In the midst of a respiratory pandemic, the government has to finally take the necessary action to ensure clean air for all.”“Whilst this firm and our clients are sympathetic to the pressures facing government at this time, these matters are necessarily urgent in light of the likelihood of further ‘waves’ of the Covid-19 pandemic,” they said. “The longer the government delays this review, the longer this generation and the next will suffer from the impacts of Covid-19.”The letter notes that in May Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said the link between air pollution and coronavirus was “entirely plausible”, and that the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said dirty air “remains a hidden killer”. It also notes that the health minister Lord Bethell has acknowledged evidence that inhaling pollution particles might “increase the spread or severity of Covid-19”.The lawyers have asked Eustice to commit to a review by 23 June and publish it within three months. If the government refuses, Mums for Lungs and the Good Law Project will consider further legal action.A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We remain committed to being a world leader in tackling air pollution. As we rebuild our economy in response to the coronavirus pandemic, we will continue to shape a cleaner, greener and more resilient society.”Neil Parish, the chair of the environment select committee, said: “Even before the coronavirus pandemic, air pollution was vastly overlooked. The pandemic is threatening to push back some of the crucial work planned for addressing poor air quality, when it is clear that it should instead be a once-in-a-lifetime catalyst for action.”The Hausfeld letter to Eustice is also backed by the Students for Global Health group. Its director, Harpreet Kaur, said: “A green recovery is vital to tackling the hidden crisis of air pollution. It is important we move on this quickly to ensure a healthy environment for current and future generations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c89457216b0158c185ef617bed7499fa7712d223/136_0_1645_987/master/1645.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d61793a6023dc5cb55f7e0aa2b4fc1e7","title":"london fashion week goes digital seven things we learned","story":"The menswear shows went digital for the first time last weekend. But did it work? The fashion desk takes a look at this unique event A video conversation between the London mayor and editor-in-chief of British Vogue was a twofold affair, as they discussed George Floyd and systemic racism alongside Covid19 and its effect on the British fashion industry. But it was as candid and it was crucial – who suffers the most in a recession? What is the impact of pre-existing structural inequality in society? How do we prevent unemployment in the fashion sector? And why do we need to wear masks?With regards fashion, they talked about the need to promote the contribution made by the fashion industry during the pandemic, from the economy (one in six jobs British jobs are within the fashion industry, said Khan, it is “our golden egg”) and the people that work in “the pipelines” to the industry’s mass production of PPE and the future of creative graduates. As Khan said: “we don’t want creative talent leaving to go to countries that will better support them than ours.” MFLockdown forced Fletcher to rethink his collection, resulting in a streamlined more sustainable 12 look edit that utilised the fabrics he already had in his London studio. He worked directly with a network of seamstresses he has employed on previously. “This collection is a testament to the skill and hard work of these amazing women: I dedicate this collection to them.” Less is most definitely more. HSBefore George Floyd’s murder, London-based designer Charles Jeffrey had planned to throw a virtual party during digital fashion week, promoting a capsule quarantine-produced collection in the process. Instead, he gave the platform to a handful of POC creatives, creating a digital ‘happening’ to raise money for UK Black Pride.Its stars were MC Miss Jason of Jason’s Closet dancer and choreographer Malij Nashad Sharpe singer-songwriter Rachel Chinouriri and spoken word poet Kai Isaiah Jamal. University of Westminster graduates Catherine Hudson and Halina Edwards designed clothes and spoke about their work in accompanying videos.Hudson said that her “Cool Rasta” collection was designed to distort “the male form to reflect internalized micro-aggressions” Edwards explained that she was researching the Black Curriculum alongside her fashion work “I’m just so passionate to share the wealth of education there is.” It was a powerful and exuberant half hour on the internet - and underlined the importance of ‘passing the mike,’ as Miss Jason described it, in creative professions, a development we very much hope outlasts the pandemic. HMSaturday morning’s three way zoom call between menswear designer Bianca Saunders, photographer Joshua Woods and modelwriter Jess Cole to talk about their artpoetryfashion collaboration provided food for the soul. Although at the top Saunders said that the work “didn’t have much to do with the current climate,” it was hard not to see their zine as a timely statement of lyrical black beauty and the energy that occurs when black creatives work together. “If we’re constantly seeing white narrative in front of us,” said Woods, “it becomes liberating to see narratives around black lives.”Featuring male-female twin couples dressing in Saunders’ archive collections from Spring Summer 19 and Autumn Winter 19, the photos by Woods had a nostalgic and rich feeling about them. They highlighted the gendered dichotomy of Saunders clothes which combined a feminine softness with masculine lines and fabrics like leather and denim. “My work is based around finding the similarities between each other,” said Saunders.The designer hinted that her next collection SS21 which she’s working on in lockdown would feature a sunny outlook. “I want to inject the idea that joy is really important,” she said. PEMarques Almeida – a brand set up in London by Portugese couple Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida in 2011 – have always been about community, with erse street casting a big part of their MO. But it was the arrival of two daughters, Maria and Alice, that inspired reM’Ade, a new in-house brand to use the deadstock of various factories in Portugal - as this sweet video details. Available for pre-order only, see biker jackets made from prints, and striped frilled skirts, with each piece potentially unique. It is a way to think about a new way of working, and to, as Almeida says “start by tidying up the house, and work with what you have.” LCIn the same way Priya Ahluwalia weaves strands of her dual Indian and Nigerian heritage into her sustainable patchwork designs, her presentation for London Fashion Week, explores her roots and traces what it means to be a young, mixed heritage person living in London.The presentation was shown alongside her second book, Jalebi, a digital 3D exhibition and photography book focused on a series of images taken by photographer Laurence Ellis,a loving portrayal of Southall in west London, Britain’s first Punjabi community. The images flit ‘back and forth between the imagined and real’, from shots of fanciful cars draped in beautiful patchwork blankets, to portraits of local iniduals living their everyday lives.The designer also included images of her own family, who have been a great inspiration to her since she founded her eponymous brand, and places them alongside quotes from her ‘Nana’ which illustrate the family’s experience living between India and Britain. While the exhibition is a celebration of ersity and immigration, it does not shy away from the difficulties of living in an immigrant community, and includes photographs from the 2019 Memorial march in remembrance of Gurdip Singh Chaggar who was murdered by National Front racists in 1976. All profits from Jalebi, along with the photographic print sales, will be donated to the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust and to Southall Black Sisters. Available online for £35 at ahluwaliastudio. PBDaley’s AW20 show, originally staged in January, was a highlight of LFWM. So it’s a pleasure to see a video of it, which focuses on both the clothes and the musicians - including drummer Kwake Bass - that Daley collaborated with on a site-specific composition. Daley is a big music fan and this collection has both Jimi Hendrix and the Art Ensemble of Chicago on the moodboard - along with the dreamy paintings of Guyanese artist, Frank Bowling.The Abstract Truth perhaps brings the idea of afrofuturism to style. Or, as Daley says, it shows “everything has been interconnected and continues my own creative journey connecting fashion, music and culture.” LC"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae1d964b755c57e7acae4000c62c4b6ef2bad3ae/1205_1094_4363_2618/master/4363.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0123c3c449ac55ab303659592c027604","title":"rachel roddy recipe for green beans in cream with roast chicken","story":"The last days of lockdown and the early summer brings a gradual awakening to the trattoria of Rome, and the welcome return of a favourite dish of seasonal green beansHis hands on his hips, Andrea walked down the middle of the room, counting.\u0026nbspIt was the day before restaurants and trattorie could, if they adhered to a series of conditions, reopen in Rome. I happened to be walking by and noticed the metal shutters half rolled up, like sleepy eyes after two months of induced coma, so put my head round the door and shouted hello into the cavernous dimness. “That’s 72, 76, 82, plus the tables outside … 108 covers”, Andrea summed, before sitting at a table and signalling for me to join. No doubt he knows the number of covers as well as he knows the arches and velveteen seats of his father’s restaurant, the place he grew up in. He was counting in order to ide the number in two: removing half the tables and carving up the room with space is one of the regional conditions for reopening.Like his father negotiating with the fishmonger, the vein in Andrea’s neck bulged as he told me of the failure of the furlough system and read me the rest of the conditions. Clean cloths for every table, hand sanitiser at the door and for wiping down plasticised menus, masks and gloves for staff, just masks for customers until the point of eating (at no point are they to be placed on the table), no coats on hooks, no shared condiments or jars of toothpicks, no unnecessary movements or proximity, or wandering children, or lingering near the door. The list, with the exception of the cloths, reads like a roll call against the nature of a Roman family restaurant the antithesis of everything that makes them what they are. This, he summed, coupled with fear and the fact so many have so little money, meant no one would come.But they did, the next night. An older couple with their daughter and her tiny dog, three couples and two groups of four, us three, all seated on the well-spaced tables outside, the warm breeze flapping the cloths. Now it was the turn of the father’s vein to throb as he passed from table to table, each welcome filled with worry, for his staff that can’t come to work yet, that we minded the masks and the conditions. It was our turn to reassure him that we are so used to masks, we don’t even notice them and, if we do, it is because they are leopardprint that we were simply glad to be back with our legs under the thick cloths, holding heavy glasses filled with house wine and eating foil packets of salted crackers while we waited for fried anchovies, spaghetti tangled round clams and – the sign that summer is here – plates of green beans. It was the beans I enjoyed most, for their almost waxy, buttery bite, but also because they were tailed, boiled and put on a white plate with half a lemon and a slick of olive oil, then landed on the table by Augusto with a worried judder – and because they are what I always have.\u0026nbspNow it is their season, and they are plentiful and a good price, we cook greens beans at home, too, boiling them in well-salted water until they don’t squeak, then tossing them in salt, olive oil and lemon while they are still warm – all’agro. Other times I braise them with tomato, toss them with toasted hazelnuts and batons of bacon, or follow a recipe from the summer section in Margaret Costa’s Four Seasons Cookery Book and bake them with soured cream and breadcrumbs.Sitting at a spaced-out table, it is an insistent thought for me that Roman family restaurants and trattoria remind me of my Granny’s pub in Oldham. The same direct intimacy and fulfilment of a need, a familiarly and sociability (even if you are in a solitary mood) and immutability, even in the face of 12 regulations and plough lines of space and, for so many, reassurance in the face of so much uncertainty.These beans go with many things, but especially well with roast chicken, cooked the way you like best – which for me is Simon Hopkinson’s way: the chicken is ripped, rather than carved, and tossed in its own buttery juices.1.6-1.8kg chickenButter and olive oil450g green beans250ml soured creamSalt and black pepperNutmeg1 pinch caraway or dill seeds40g soft white breadcrumbs40g butter, melted, plus more for dishHeat the oven to 230C (210 fan)gas 8. Rub the chicken all over with butter or olive oil and put on a baking tray or in a cast-iron pan. Squeeze over the juice of half a lemon, then stuff the empty halves inside the chicken.Roast the chicken for 15 minutes, baste, then reduce the heat to 190C (170C fan)gas 5. Roast for a further 50 minutes, basting twice more.While the chicken is roasting, tail the beans, cook them in boiling salted water for six minutes, then drain.\u0026nbspPut the cream in bowl, season with salt, black pepper, nutmeg and caraway or dill seeds, then add the beans and toss until coated. Tip the beans into an ovenproof dish and use a spatula to scrape in the cream.\u0026nbspMelt the butter, pull from the heat, add the breadcrumbs, stir, then tip over the beans.\u0026nbspFor the last 15 minutes of roasting, put the beans in the oven alongside the chicken, and bake until the crumbs are golden and the edges bubbling.

Bleak, with José Mourinho the first to say so. The manager had major injury concerns, with Harry Kane, Son Heung-min, Moussa Sissoko and Steven Bergwijn each a long-term casualty. The squad looked tired and unbalanced, with Mourinho repeatedly bemoaning the fact that without Kane – who ruptured a hamstring tendon on 1 January – he had no senior No 9. The manager made no secret of his frustration at the failure to sign a new striker in the mid-season window. Unlike his predecessor, Mauricio Pochettino, he does not consider Son to be able to play at centre-forward. The team had rather ridden their luck at times – in the home wins over Manchester City and Southampton for instance, the latter in an FA Cup replay. After that game Mourinho said: “It’s very difficult to progress the way we want. Basically, it’s game to game, building a team with what we have.” Then the luck ran out. Spurs hit the shutdown on a sequence of six games without a win, a period when they were eliminated from the FA Cup and Champions League, and slipped to eighth in the Premier League.What about now? All change. From pessimism to optimism. The fitness situation has improved radically with the aforementioned quartet all ready to play, although there are now doubts over Giovani Lo Celso. Son even found the time to fit in his mandatory four-week basic soldiers’ training course in South Korea. Mourinho has had bonus weeks to work with his squad, making it like the pre-season he never had although, plainly, the Covid-19 protocols have meant that things have been different.What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season? Finish in a Champions League spot, which will be fifth rather than fourth if Manchester City’s looming ban from the competition is upheld that would appear a lot more attainable. Champions League revenues are vital to the club as they feel their way into the era of the new stadium and try to cope with anticipated losses of more than £200m for the period to June 2021 because of the pandemic.Any unsungcommunity heroes? In addition to the community work from Mourinho and the players, the club have delivered NHS services at their stadium, with North Middlesex university hospital using it for Covid-19 drive-through testing and the relocation of its women’s outpatient services. The testing has been for hospital staff and key workers from other health and social care organisations while the outpatient services have been to support the redirection of pregnant women away from the hospital’s main facility. The services will continue to be accommodated as matches return.Key player in the run-in? Kane. Who else? Remember what Mourinho said after he signed Bergwijn at the end of January to supplement the pace and creativity of Son, Lucas Moura and Erik Lamela in wide areas. “Imagine Harry Kane with these four options on the side, it’s magnificent,” he said. Of course, he went on to say that without Kane the team were going to have a problem at centre-forward but now that all the pieces are in play, will there be fireworks? This has been the worst injury of Kane’s career and the longest lay-off – even before the pandemic. How will it affect his strength and explosiveness?End-of-season prediction “We don’t have the right to lose games”, according to the captain, Hugo Lloris. Fourth place looks beyond them and, in the fight for fifth, much will depend on the matches against Manchester United, Sheffield United and Arsenal, which are too tight to call. Mourinho has largely struggled to instil a cohesive attacking gameplan while defensively there have been too many errors and too few clean sheets. He needs to find the answers – quickly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bdf5e9ffccff98747a663bd8a1a5131d499dc31/0_382_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=669560bfcc8c2f6ac04df89e0142863a","title":"being online has helped us survive how e commerce can kickstart your small business in lockdown and beyond","story":"Many SMEs have had to ramp up their digital activity in response to the challenges of Covid-19, learning as they go. Here, three businesses share what they’ve discoveredGiven the way that we shop is changing, it has never been more important for retailers to get online. In a survey for the website builder GoDaddy, a fifth of micro businesses said they had gone online for the first time during lockdown and nearly half that their use of digital and social media tools had increased.For some, e-commerce has always been part of the plan. The artisan hot chocolate company Knoops opened its first store in Rye, East Sussex, in 2013, and went on to open a London store in February this year, with more planned. But head of marketing Anna Chapman says that having an online presence was always a key part of the company’s strategy. “Chocolate has a broad appeal, and we wanted to be able to reach people in their homes, especially those who didn’t live near our stores,” she says.\u0026nbspThe company’s website centres around its hot chocolate maker, the Knoopifier, with owners getting access to online subscriptions for pouches of “Knoopifier” chocolate buttons delivered to their home. The website has always been an important part of the company’s strategy, but Chapman says that lockdown emphasised this further.\u0026nbsp“While our doors were closed, it was obviously the only way we could take any revenue at all, and we were able to focus our efforts entirely on our website and social media channels,” she says. “This importance will remain – the majority of retailers now accept that an omnichannel approach is vital. Our current situation has been an extremely stark reminder of its importance.”For other SMEs, while a website may have been part of their business, using it to sell is a recent addition. Rob Wilson, “chief toaster” at Toast Ale, a craft beer brewer that uses bread which would otherwise be wasted, says that despite having an online presence, it wasn’t really part of the business’s strategy.\u0026nbspBut when those sales channels were cut off during lockdown, Toast Ale, which donates its profits to sustainability charities, was forced to shift its sales online. “We started to rebuild our website and have far more focus on a more functional online shop. It has massively transformed our business and helped us survive – it’s become a huge opportunity to reach a whole new audience. We just hadn’t thought about it as a sales channel and now we’ve suddenly realised its potential.”Similarly, Chris Fryer, founder of the vegan pie business Magpye, hadn’t really explored e-commerce, instead selling pies from his converted horse box at events and supplying local pubs in the north of England. “We had a full calendar of events booked. We were supplying pubs with pies and had just expanded, dropping off to four or five pubs twice a week. Then our income stopped – it was a cliff-edge.”\u0026nbspLike Wilson at Toast Ale, Fryer realised quickly that he would have to shift to e-commerce and has been similarly amazed by the effect it has had.\u0026nbsp“At the moment we’re just doing local deliveries across the north east but we’re looking into expanding. Our plan potentially is to sell our horsebox and become a web-based pie shop,” he says.When it comes to setting up an e-commerce site, there is an increasingly wide range of tools available to business owners from a range of sources. They include web hosting companies such as GoDaddy, which has created Open We Stand – a portal of resources for small businesses during lockdown. Fryer says that while he has some experience building websites, it was quicker and easier to turn to readymade tools with GoDaddy.“I had the domain registered with GoDaddy but had done nothing with it. Once it became clear we would have to move online I started looking into it. I could have gone down the route of coding it from scratch but it would have taken a week or two, especially things like payment options. With the GoDaddy tools it took half a day, then I spent a day or two testing and it was ready to go. Although we didn’t use the option, I knew GoDaddy would build the site for you for free if you needed,” he says.“They do a free three-month trial, so there’s really nothing to lose by having a go. The admin side, monitoring it, doing the orders is all quite simple, so even if you’ve got no skills whatsoever I don’t think many people would struggle with it.”At Toast Ale, the switch was led by COO Louisa Ziane, who has experience of managing websites. Wilson is adamant that the work has paid off, with e-commerce proving an “amazing opportunity”, not just now but, he believes, in the future. “I would say that at current rates we’re looking at probably half a million pounds of revenue coming from our online shop. Last year as a business we took around £1m in total, so that shows that it is very quickly becoming a significant part of our business.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed. Over 50 companies have joined the cause, including Slack, Salesforce, PayPal, and more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc1f8e50fd583471a0543292c6ccdd1e916ae1a4/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b11342e3fbe1321d9b47bccc4bad13d","title":"lockdown shopping have you ordered items that werent what you expected","story":"Whether you ordered the wrong item or it it wasn’t quite what you expected, we’d like to hear from youWith around 50,000 new businesses signing up to eBay UK in April, more people appear to be buying online due to lockdown.If you have ordered an item that was not quite what you expected, we want to hear from you.What did you buy and why was it unexpected?

Broadcasters’ reputations have taken a hit but they continue to score relatively highly, while the  is now the most trusted non-financial newspaper among the general public.However, the figures suggest there has been a substantial negative shift in attitudes towards the wider media industry among Britons. As a result, Britain now ranks below the likes of the US and Hong Kong when it comes to public trust in the media.The research also suggests it may be time to reappraise which news outlets are considered to be the biggest in the country, in an age where print newspaper sales continue to collapse and even Rupert Murdoch’s News UK – the owner of the Times and the Sun – is moving towards a digital-focused operation.Rather than the traditional ranking of outlets by print newspaper sales, the report points towards the emergence of a group of four major British news outlets with mass online audiences: BBC News, the , MailOnline and Sky News.The BBC remains the most trusted national news outlet, but support among the most politically partisan consumers – on both the left and right – has fallen by 20 percentage points since 2018.The study found there was a “silent majority” of Britons who still strongly wanted the news to be presented in a “neutral and detached” manner, backing BBC news bosses who discourage their reporters from expressing personal political views on social media."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0974debfde28a284d1135ff64202d9a7c64c8bd7/0_11_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=12a23a492effe15411582c9906291cb6","title":"bootsy collins were all funky just not all of us know it","story":"The P-Funk bassist was a street kid in the 60s, got his break with James Brown, then spent much of the 70s taking LSD. He talks about drugs, racism, police brutality – and the healing power of musicAt the age of 17, William “Bootsy” Collins packed up his homemade bass guitar and left home to tour the world with James Brown. He was heading off in pursuit of the funk. Or, as he calls it now – aged 68, in his high-pitched rasp down the phone from Cincinnati, Ohio – “the fonk”.\u0026nbspIn the five decades since, Collins’s bass has changed the shape of music. Not only did he play on some of Brown’s best-known and most political records – Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine, Superbad and Soul Power – but he has also had a hand in pop hits from Deee-Lite’s Groove Is in the Heart to Fatboy Slim’s Weapon of Choice and Snoop Dogg’s What’s My Name (Snoop Dogg). After working with Brown, he would discover LSD, join George Clinton’s Parliament-Funkadelic and help carry the torch for unapologetic bohemian black music after Jimi Hendrix’s death. He found his signature style – star-shaped sunglasses, skin-tight leathers and top hats – and became an icon of afrofuturism.Born in 1951 in Cincinnati, Collins spent his childhood with his guitarist brother, Phelps, AKA “Catfish”, and his mother – who worked several jobs to make ends meet. “Growing up, we were tough,” Collins says. “We came up during the civil rights riots. We were street kids.”On the day we speak, it is a week on from the horrifying police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. Protests are erupting throughout the US, and Donald Trump has called for aggressive policing. Having lived through the civil rights movement, does he feel this is a moment of reckoning for race in the US?\u0026nbspWhat has changed, he says, is the availability of images of police brutality. “Now, everybody sees when these incidents happen. There’s no secret, it’s recorded, it’s straight out into the world. We’ve been through enough and we need to come together. I know it has been said for ever, but it feels like time really is running out now.”In typical Collins fashion, his response to the global pandemics of Covid-19 and systemic racism comes in his own brand of galactic funk. Holed up in his ranch –\u0026nbspknown as Bootzilla –\u0026nbspCollins has been spending the lockdown finalising his 10th solo album, The Power of the One. “It’s been a strange time really good for music, but bad in many other ways.” While the album is not due until October, a charity single, Stars, was released last week, featuring a sample of the academic Cornel West talking powerfully on CNN, in the wake of Floyd’s killing, about the ways the US has failed its black citizens. “Covid gave me some time to reset,” Collins says. “I decided to put something out that was uplifting and that would hopefully help heal the planet.”Collins genuinely believes music has the power to heal. “Funk just brings people together, from the ground up,” he says. “It doesn’t have nothing to do with colour. It has nothing to do with status. It just brings you to ‘the one’, and the one thing that we all have in common is that we all just want to live. That’s what it’s really all about. It’s making something from nothing, like me.”Growing up, Collins and his brother had “two dollars a week between us”, he says. Catfish, who was seven years Bootsy’s senior, got a guitar first. “I started off trying to emulate him by playing the guitar. I would hang out with him and his band, trying to see if they would let me join.” One day, they needed a bassist. So he improvised. “I took this guitar we had and just put bass strings on it and that was all it took –\u0026nbspI was a bass player.”The pair started spending time at the local King Records studio, hoping to run into more prominent acts that might recruit them as a backing band. Their break came when a record executive, Charles Spurling, heard them play and enlisted them as the band for blues and black country-and-western acts such as Bill Doggett, Hank Ballard and Arthur Prysock.It was when Brown heard them in 1969, though, that they struck gold. Brown had been recording at the King studios and was just entering his gly cape-wearing “godfather of soul” phase. “When James Brown came along, suddenly we were living the big life. We got all the girls and we would get loaded,” he says. “What else could a kid want?”\u0026nbspBrown would provide much more than fame, women and drugs, however. While his own success was reaching frenzied levels internationally, he was also gaining notoriety for his domineering and overbearing presence. His previous backing band had walked out after disagreements over pay and he had started to fine members for lateness or mistakes. “I never had a father and he took that role on. He did a good job. I needed that discipline. I would do any kind of wild thing otherwise.” He was never fearful of Brown. “He couldn’t intimidate us like the others because we were already tough.”Over the course of 11 months spent with Brown as part of the backing band, the JBs, Collins rehearsed until his fingers bled, trying to hone in on the heartbeat of this nascent, stridently black genre of music. The group toured and recorded relentlessly, making a “homecoming” trip to Africa and visiting Fela Kuti in Nigeria, who afterwards kept up a friendly rivalry with Brown.As with any father-and-son relationship, though, the rebellious streak soon emerged in teenage Collins. “James would start accusing me of being high, even when I wasn’t, so one day I just decided to drop acid to prove him right,” he says. The consequences were, of course, disastrous. “You had to be so tight with his music, there was no way you could play it when you were high. He called me into the back room and I was out of my mind – my bass had turned into a snake – and he fired me, but I just couldn’t stop laughing. I don’t remember what happened with the rest of that night.”Being in Parliament-Funkadelic “was just total freedom”, Collins says. “It was like being finally accepted. We could play whatever we wanted and fully express ourselves in whatever we wanted to wear, too. There were no walls between us and the sky, you could just keep reaching and reaching.”\u0026nbspThere followed an intensely creative decade of work with Clinton and his P-Funk collective, with Collins part of Parliament-Funkadelic, as well as playing with his own Bootsy’s Rubber Band and under the names Caspar the Funky Ghost and Bootzilla. He even landed a solo US No 1 with 1978’s playful single Bootzilla. After Hendrix’s death in 1970, Collins and Clinton were some of the few black musicians continuing his legacy, now with added theatrics. While Hendrix may have torched his guitar in a state of devotional rapture at Monterey Pop festival, by 1976 Parliament-Funkadelic had built their own “spaceship” under the chaotic leadership of Dr Funkenstein –\u0026nbspone of Clinton’s alter egos. The P-Funk Earth tour, in which the mothership landed on stage, was a carnival spectacle of celebratory blackness.\u0026nbsp“When we brought the spaceship down to the stage, it was like a religious revival,” Collins says. “We realised we were a part of a bigger thing, a larger expression of community. When the mothership would come down, there was this rapture it was like the first time you made love and you would never forget it.” It was a new vision of audience communion, something akin to the hippy love-ins of the previous decade.But the party couldn’t last. “I was losing touch with myself and it was hard to separate the Bootsy on stage from the person I was beneath the outfits,” Collins says. “I wasn’t in a very good place and I realised I was in too deep.” With help from his partner, Patti, he got sober in the mid-80s. Collins married Patti in 1996 and she now helps him run the Bootsy Collins Foundation, a charitable organisation for children’s musical education.By the time he returned to music in 1988, with the electrofunk record What’s Bootsy Doin’?, hip-hop was in the ascendant. It was a genre predicated on the sampling of P-Funk and Brown. That same year, NWA released their debut album, Straight Outta Compton. Dr Dre of NWA was so indebted to the P-Funk sound that he would call his later work G-funk. In a matter of a few years, Collins had morphed from the young, prodigal tearaway of a tumultuous funk orgy into an elder statesman of a revered genre a superhero of the bass.Today, it is this legacy on which he is focused. This summer, Collins will restart his online Funk University, providing tutorials and lessons for aspiring musicians. “We have to nurture the talent that we have now, as it’s just so much more difficult for them to get noticed,” he says. “The funk is in the power of the one and so we have to work together to spread that message. That’s what I’m interested in.”It might seem trite or overly optimistic for Collins to be so focused on a blanket message of unity while race relations in the US feel on the verge of an irrevocable and violent rift. Yet hope has seen him through other dark times, such as the trauma of the late 60s. \u0026nbsp“People are so status-obsessed and they just don’t realise that we are all the same, that this whole Earth is our mothership and we’re all on board,” he says softly. “You can laugh if you want to, because I’ve been laughed at before, but none of that means anything to me any more. What means something is that we all get a chance to get heard and that we help each other out. We’re all funky, just not all of us know it.”Bootsy Collins’s Stars is out now all proceeds from the streams and downloads go to the MusiCares Covid-19 relief fund"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f723a9eeb2d36465aac3db1b2cac33eb5d1f5bcd/563_769_2520_1511/master/2520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21761135398a65a9677d41f215af0158","title":"how we made black box ride on time","story":"‘We didn’t realise she was singing “Right on time”. It was a mistake, but the title stayed – some people thought we were being clever’ I was an avid collector of disco and funk records. On my first trip to the US, I spent most of my time in secondhand vinyl shops and found Loleatta Holloway’s Love Sensation. At the time, I was playing with my Akai S900 sampler when I was DJing and searching for a cappella vocals to enrich my set. When I listened to Love Sensation, I thought: “This is good stuff.” People were using a lot of powerful vocals in their records – like The Power by Snap. My bandmate Mirko Limoni and I wanted to make the most energetic record in the world, and we were trying to collect material for that.Alfredo, who was the DJ at the Ibiza club Amnesia, bought it. Danny Rampling, Nicky Holloway and Paul Oakenfold went to Amnesia and heard the record. So Oakenfold and Rampling decided it was time to go to Rimini, which was like the Italian Ibiza, where they bought as many copies as they could to take back to England. Later, Oakenfold told me he had paid for his holiday with copies of Ride on Time he had bought in Rimini and then resold.In the meantime, the label Deconstruction called Discomagic said they really wanted to license the first track Mirko and I made together – Starlight’s Numero Uno. Discomagic said: “Unfortunately, we just licensed it to Beggars Banquet. But we’ve got something we think is even better.” Deconstruction told me they couldn’t believe their ears when they heard it. And that was Ride on Time.I couldn’t believe my luck the first time we were on Top of the Pops. We were in the same room as Phil Collins and Eurythmics – and they were talking to us!Our bad English was the reason it was called Ride on Time. We thought she was singing “ride on time”, but it was “right on time”. Of course it was a mistake, but the title stayed. It’s one of those mistakes that’s funny. Some people thought we were being clever.We thought we would sell a maximum of 1,000 copies for clubs. For us, that would have been like winning the London marathon. It was a big surprise when it blew up. Of course we were happy about it, but then the problems came. The same day we took the plane to England to be on Top of the Pops, we had to deal with the American lawyer threatening us.I didn’t realise, while I was living it, how big Ride on Time was. When I look back, it seems bigger than it did at the time. My best memory of it is the night we received the phone call from Deconstruction after the midweek charts to say we were going to be No 1. The record had entered the charts at 39, then went up in four or five weeks to No 1 and stayed there for six weeks. When we learned it was No 1, it was very emotional."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e224368694f02db1d63ef736934da6690cbd92/0_18_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01f5ed3327e1d5fc7d19f157fa1bbecf","title":"how the disappearance of madeleine mccann became a national obsession podcast","story":"The disappearance of a three -year-old British girl at a Portuguese holiday resort in 2007 quickly became a global news story as the hunt for her grew ever more extensive.

Not least because almost no one had called on him to do so.Nor was he going to allow anyone to Photoshop British history. Quite apart from a staggering inability to understand the difference between eradicating the difficult and complicated nature of the country’s past and actively memorialising and celebrating it, this was quite some cheek. Because few politicians have done more to Photoshop their own past than Boris. The lies, the deceit and the lack of morality that have been the bedrock of both his personal and professional life are all expected to be forgotten on a daily basis. After all, if he can find it so easy to forgive himself why shouldn’t everyone else?So it was left to Priti Patel to comment on last weekend’s violent protests in London in a ministerial statement to the Commons. And to begin with she didn’t do too badly. The home secretary is clearly a lot more comfortable in condemning violence from leftwing and Black Lives Matter activists, but she somehow managed to get through her opening remarks without saying that the rightwing racists were due a little leeway to let off steam after being provoked by the demonstrations of the previous weekend, which had seen some violence against police and statues being torn down and defaced. The desire to make the link was clearly there but somehow she managed to restrain herself. Credit where credit is due.Labour’s Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, initially appeared to endorse Patel’s comments. He deplored the actions of the demonstrators, praised the police and more or less backed her demands for 10-year jail sentences for anyone defacing public monuments. Only in the UK could you expect to get banged up longer for public disorder offences than rape. But then just as it looked as if he was going to try to outcompete the Tories in the “lock ’em up” stakes, Thomas-Symonds started to twist the knife.The BLM demonstrations had been of a different category to Saturday’s racist protests. While violence on both sides could not be condoned, there had been a moral purpose to BLM. Longstanding injustices and inequalities that had been consistently ignored.So how was it that in the prime minister’s 1,000-word defence of the statue of Winston Churchill, he had only managed to squeeze in a couple of sentences as an afterthought about his plans to establish a new Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, while saying it was about time black people stopped playing the victim card? Besides, hadn’t there already been enough reports into racial inequality and wouldn’t the government be a lot better off implementing some of their recommendations instead?Patel was genuinely outraged. At times like this, her innate hopelessness is her saving grace as she doesn’t have to go through the bother of even feigning stupidity. Black lives mattered so much that it would be entirely wrong for the prime minister to implement the recommendations of previous reports without wasting time on setting up an entirely pointless new commission that was almost certain to come to exactly the same conclusions as before.If you read the Macpherson, Lammy and Williams reports carefully, you would know that their overarching subtext was that what black and minority ethnic people wanted more than anything was for nothing to change until the government had checked whether the recommendations could be recommended. Equality was far too important a subject for change to be introduced at anything but glacial pace.A few Tories tried to bring the debate back to what they believed to be the key topics. The desecration of statues and the racist abuse that they had received for daring to criticise the violence against the police at the BLM demonstrations. Patel was suitably grateful for the breather.But there was no respite from opposition MPs. Yes, they could all agree violence was bad but could we move back to the real issues of inequality? Priti just looked Priti Vacant. She seemed genuinely surprised to learn that there were so many Windrush cases still unresolved and no one had told her there were recommendations about the effect of the coronavirus on BAME communities that had yet to be published. There again, she hadn’t asked. After all, she was only the home secretary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d08a1fe6f0b9f46b1312e28e34493918f6bdaa6/0_351_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a3e26311e4b46f72e3f4f52477ff1c4d","title":"how to use music to boost your running whether over a mile or a marathon","story":"From music’s effects on fatigue to its motivational properties, the right soundtrack is a powerful tool for improving your ability to run wellEveryone knows there’s a link between music and running. Barely a gym lets a cross-training machine go unaccompanied by hi-NRG dance tunes. There’s a great choice of running playlists on Spotify, some with millions of likes from users who’ve found that the right music can push them farther and faster. Bruce Springsteen has even written a whole album about being born to run. But if you want to use music to help improve your running, it’s important to get to grips with the science, and how it applies to your running style.Given that most runners tend to follow a pace of 150 to 180 steps per minute, you need music that corresponds to that. One option is to pick music that has about 150-180bpm, so that you can match your steps to the beat. “Foo Fighters’ The Pretender, which has about 170bpm, is really, really popular with runners,” says Hallett.However, 150-180bpm is very fast in terms of tempo, so there’s relatively little recorded at those speeds – with the exception of more high-energy rock’n’roll, thrash metal or speed garage. So another option is to aim for music that matches your stride cycle – ie two steps rather than one. This lets you pick music that’s much slower. Something that’s particularly good? Hip-hop.One of the most pleasant ways to run is to do so in what’s known as a “flow state”. It’s a highly enjoyable feeling of being completely immersed in what you’re doing to the point where it’s as though you’re on autopilot, but which is in itself highly enjoyable. It’s also been shown to enhance running endurance.Karageorghis did a study where he ran people to exhaustion during a beep test and found that those who listened to music more easily entered flow state. But in order to enter flow state, it’s important to have the right listening experience. The more continuous the listening experience, the easier it is to enter flow state. So if you’re planning to go on a reasonably lengthy run, it’s best to avoid music with ads, and to ensure you’re not listening in a way that might be interrupted by poor signal. Using Spotify Premium, with ad-free music and offline listening, is one way to keep the flow state flowing, if you will. “Having interrupted music can be a little distracting and disconcerting – it’s not as beneficial as having continuous music,” says Karageorghis. “That’s why I often encourage people to create end-to-end playlists that contour their workout.”One of the most important ways that music can help take your running to the next level is by making you feel less tired when you exercise. When you’re listening to a soundtrack, you’re giving your brain something to process other than your physical activity. The music distracts it from focusing on the effect exercise is having on your body, so the parts of the brain that speak to each other to communicate fatigue are less able to do so – meaning you feel less exhausted than you otherwise would.“It’s as though the music takes up some of your brain’s bandwidth that would normally be used for communication with the working muscles and the organs,” says Karageorghis. “It limits the degree to which fatigue-related signals can enter conscious awareness.”One thing that is unaffected by how fast you’re running is music’s ability to make you feel like you’re enjoying yourself. Even at higher intensities, studies have found that music can make people enjoy exercise more than they otherwise would.Karageorghis has also found that not only does music enhance how pleasurable your run is, but it enhances your memory of your run. It makes you remember your runs more positively, associates them more with being positive experiences and increases your probability of running more frequently. As to the right type of music to ensure that your brain responds positively to running? That depends entirely on you.“It’s often to do with the personal associations that the music has for you,” says Hallett. “I had a participant who listened to music from their university days because it took them back to a time when they had less responsibility. Going on a run felt like a bit of escapism for them. Others were motivated by music that reminded them of people they knew. It depends what has meaning to you.”Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

They may not arrive in a vast spaceship. But according to new calculations there could be more than 30 intelligent civilisations in our galaxy today capable of communicating with others.Experts say the work not only offers insights into the chances of life beyond Earth but could shed light on our own future and place in the cosmos.“I think it is extremely important and exciting because for the first time we really have an estimate for this number of active intelligent, communicating civilisations that we potentially could contact and find out there is other life in the universe – something that has been a question for thousands of years and is still not answered,” said Christopher Conselice, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Nottingham and a co-author of the research.In 1961 the astronomer Frank Drake proposed what became known as the Drake equation, setting out seven factors that would need to be known to come up with an estimate for the number of intelligent civilisations out there. These factors ranged from the the average number of stars that form each year in the galaxy through to the time over which a civilisation would be expected to be sending out detectable signals.Now Conselice and colleagues report in the Astrophysical Journal how they refined the equation with new data and assumptions to come up with their estimates.He added that, while it is a speculative theory, he believes alien life would have similarities in appearance to life on Earth. “We wouldn’t be super shocked by seeing them,” he said.Under the strictest set of assumptions – where, as on Earth, life forms between 4.5bn and 5.5bn years after star formation – there are likely between four and 211 civilisations in the Milky Way today capable of communicating with others, with 36 the most likely figure. But Conselice noted that this figure is conservative, not least as it is based on how long our own civilisation has been sending out signals into space – a period of just 100 years so far.Dr Oliver Shorttle, an expert in extrasolar planets at the University of Cambridge who was not involved in the research, said several as yet poorly understood factors needed to be unpicked to make such estimates, including how life on Earth began and how many Earth-like planets considered habitable could truly support life.Dr Patricia Sanchez-Baracaldo, an expert on how Earth became habitable, from the University of Bristol, was more upbeat, despite emphasising that many developments were needed on Earth for conditions for complex life to exist, including photosynthesis. “But, yes if we evolved in this planet, it is possible that intelligent life evolved in another part of the universe,” she said.Prof Andrew Coates, of the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London, said the assumptions made by Conselice and colleagues were reasonable, but the quest to find life was likely to take place closer to home for now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e05d6de5de997b4ab7dc1447311e4b4712687a1/476_106_3390_2035/master/3390.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd586f0b6ed2f596191e0da1da69888d","title":"autumn schedule to be agreed by end of june but longer term agreement elusive","story":"The shape of this autumn’s international rugby programme will be confirmed by the end of this month but negotiations about a new global fixture calendar remain ongoing.Barring a significant second wave of Covid-19 infections, the 2020 Six Nations should now be completed in October and November but clubs and unions have yet to reach agreement on exactly what the longer-term future will look like.Officials representing unions, clubs and players have agreed to talk again with World Rugby keen to combine the two current Test windows into one block in October and November.While the Six Nations has indicated it would be prepared for its showpiece championship to take place a month later in the year in March and April, World Rugby admitted that “frank views” had been exchanged by various stakeholders at a online forum on Monday.The English and French clubs are particularly resistant to having their leagues shunted into less convenient time slots or being forced to shorten their current lengthy seasons.

He was funded by some of its leading figuresWhen horse racing became the first major sport, alongside snooker and greyhound racing, to return to action following its suspension due to Covid-19 at the start of this month, Matt Hancock was forthright in his delight.“Thanks to the nation’s resolve, horseracing is back from Monday,” the health secretary tweeted. “Wonderful news for our wonderful sport.”Some of those replying, including Jo Goodman, whose 72-year-old father, Stuart, died from coronavirus on 2 April, did not consider the news to be a moment for such unbridled celebration.But Hancock, along with other senior Conservatives, has nurtured a close relationship with the industry. Hancock is the MP for Newmarket, flat horse racing’s headquarters and seat of the Jockey Club, and he receives tens of thousands of pounds in donations from wealthy racehorse owners, trainers and other members of the sport’s establishment.The Jockey Club, the historic organisation that owns racecourses at Newmarket and around the country, has two prominent Conservative figures on its board: Dido Harding, the former TalkTalk chief executive and Tory peer who has been put in charge of the government’s crucial Covid-19 test-and-trace operation and Rose Paterson, the wife of the senior backbench MP Owen Paterson. Rose Paterson is also chair of Aintree racecourse, whose signature race, the Grand National, is sponsored by Randox Health, the diagnostics company advised by her husband that has been given a £133m contract to produce testing kits – without any other firms being given the opportunity to bid for the work.A source close to the Jockey Club said Harding and Rose Paterson had played no part in the process of racing being given the go-ahead to restart, which was managed by the governing body, the British Horseracing Association, to meet safety protocols set out by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. A spokesperson for Hancock said he had not taken part in any of the discussions, nor in the decision for the Cheltenham festival to go ahead on 10-13 March as the virus was spreading.During the election campaign Hancock rode the thoroughbred Star of Bengal, a horse owned by Carole Bamford, founder of the Daylesford organic farm shop chain, and wife of Anthony Bamford, the chairman of JCB, a prominent donor to the Conservative party and Brexit supporter. Hancock, wearing the party’s rosette on the gallops, tweeted afterwards: “Brilliant riding out in Newmarket this weekend on Star of Bengal. I’ll always support the wonderful sport of horseracing.”Asked about the ride, a spokesperson for Lady Bamford told the : “Lady Bamford has never met and does not know Matt Hancock. Equally she was unaware of him riding Star of Bengal last December.”Hancock’s spokesman said the ride had been arranged with John Gosden, Star of Bengal’s trainer. He was a donor to Hancock last year, paying £10,000 towards his constituency office costs. Gosden’s wife, Rachel Hood, a Conservative councillor on Suffolk county council, former president of the Racehorse Owners Association and mayor of Newmarket until last month, donated £10,000 in December 2018. Neither responded to an email from the  with questions about the donations.The entry for Hancock in the current House of Commons register of members’ interests lists £68,000 in donations since last May paid by horse racing industry figures. The largest was £25,000 paid by Unex Holdings, a Newmarket company owned by Bill Gredley, a celebrated racehorse owner and property developer, which made a £24m profit in 2018-19, according to its most recent published accounts.Gredley told the  that he gave the money towards Hancock’s constituency office costs, and had had no discussions with him about the return of racing. “I support the Tories and I support the community,” he said. “It goes to his constituency office, which has to be paid for. That’s where we’re involved, I just give him a donation, with others.”He said Hancock came to the Christmas lunch and other events for older people in Newmarket that Gredley runs through his longstanding charitable foundation. “That’s how I got to know him, and I think he’s doing a great job. I haven’t discussed the return of racing with him we’ve never talked about it.”Tattersalls, the leading racehorse bloodstock auctioneers and valuers based in Newmarket, which hold a flagship annual sale at the Cheltenham festival, gave Hancock two separate £10,000 donations, one in May last year for his constituency office, the other in November during his general election campaign. The company did not respond to questions about the reasons for the donations. Peter Stanley, the owner of the New England stud in Newmarket and a Jockey Club board member, who donated £5,000 towards Hancock’s constituency office costs, explained: “As MP for Newmarket I think he recognises that horse racing is more of an industry than a sport. He knows better than most that we are a huge export industry and foreign currency earner. I did not speak to him about getting racing started.”Claire Unwin, who stood for Labour unsuccessfully against Hancock at the election, said of the donations: “They show that he represents the wealthy, horse racing establishment in Newmarket and not the whole constituency, which is very unequal and where there are areas of severe deprivation.”Hancock declined to respond to that charge. His spokesperson said of the donations: “Matt has been an avid fan of horse racing since childhood and is passionate about the sport. Any political donations have been declared properly and, of course, done so in an open and fully transparent way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89821c796463265799d7a067237043a4cc39d068/0_0_689_413/master/689.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dbc9ed7fc0b7aacf0c734bfc6842345","title":"facebook blocks bans users sharing guardian article showing aboriginal men in chains","story":"Social media site incorrectly removed historical photo on grounds of nudity, then for three days blocked and even banned users who posted link to articleFacebook has blocked and in some cases banned users who tried to share a  article about the site incorrectly blocking an image of Aboriginal men in chains.On Saturday,  Australia reported that Facebook had apologised for incorrectly preventing an Australian user from sharing the photo from the 1890s.The post was made in the context of the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, claiming there was no slavery in Australia, before he backed down on those comments a day later.The post was removed by Facebook and the man had his account restricted, with Facebook claiming the photo contained nudity and was in breach of the social media site’s community standards.The post was restored after  Australia asked Facebook whether the photo had been flagged in error. Facebook apologised to the user late on Friday and restored the post.A spokeswoman for Facebook said the photo was removed by the automated system in error.“We apologise for this mistake,” she said.However, dozens of  readers have since reported that when they tried to post a link to the article on their profiles they received message that the post violated the same community standards.The man who first posted the image to his profile was among those unable to share the news article.Several readers were even banned from posting on Facebook for up to 30 days for attempting to share the article.After further inquiries from  Australia Facebook appeared to allow the article to be posted on Monday afternoon.Facebook typically allows users to request a review of any takedowns. Between January and March it restored 613,000 pieces of content after 2.1m requests for review.Several people pointed out the disparity between Facebook quickly (and incorrectly) censoring content it believed to contain nudity and its reluctance to take action against Donald Trump’s inflammatory posts.The journalist and activist Cory Doctorow said on Twitter the incident showed Facebook could not moderate at scale, and that automated moderating was not evenly distributed, with some minority groups more likely to have their discussions censored.Doctorow argued Facebook should not be given additional duties in censoring content, as some have called for in recent weeks over Trump’s posts on Twitter and Facebook. Instead, he said, Facebook should be cut down to a “size, to a scale where communities can set and enforce norms”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df226a2a2bef099beddb6c52d7d4cbe96323f849/0_237_6143_3685/master/6143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b49bfdbf4f1b40c94aab50b350a42c3a","title":"we rule ok englands independent island kingdoms","story":"Piel Island in Cumbria and Sealand off the coast of Essex are sovereign monarchies with their own laws, stamps … and enemiesIt isn’t commonly known that the UK has three royal families. You may have heard of a motley bunch called the Windsors, but how about King Steve and Queen Sheila of Piel Island?This 50-acre island off Barrow-in-Furness in north-west England has it all: a castle, a pub and a monarchy. Piel has been ruled peacefully for more than 500 years, with ine sovereignty automatically bestowed on whoever’s running the Ship Inn. Each year, a new Knight of the Realm is chosen. This title is not acquired, as some believe, by simply having a pint poured over your head and getting a round in. According to Queen Sheila, “myself, the king and a few princesses select whoever’s done something outstanding for our community. The last person we knighted rescued 10 people from drowning. One year it was Harry H Corbett of Steptoe and Son fame: he was a frequent visitor and created great treasure hunts for the kids.”Six miles off the SuffolkEssex coast lies Sealand, formerly Roughs Tower, one of many sea forts built during the second world war and abandoned. In 1966, it was “claimed” by former pirate radio operator Roy Bates. He declared his new home an independent principality, with himself as Prince Roy and his wife Princess Joan. Three nautical miles outside England’s legally controlled waters, Sealand was answerable to no laws except its own. Soon it had its own flag, postage stamps and currency, all bearing the image of Princess Joan’s head.Over the decades Sealand has faced a major fire and an attempted coup, after which a German lawyer and Sealand passport holder was convicted of treason and given a life sentence. (They pardoned him after seven weeks.) In 1987, in accordance with new international laws, Britain extended its territorial waters to 12 nautical miles, drawing Sealand back into British waters. In response, Prince Roy extended Sealand’s territory by the same distance. If Britain owns Sealand, it in turn now owns Felixstowe, Harwich and the nice parts of Clacton-on-Sea. An unspoken stalemate remains.Visitors wishing to meet Piel Island’s royals will have to wait until 2021, when ferries are expected to restart and its medieval castle and pub reopen. Sealand remains rather impenetrable, isolated in the North Sea, and can only be visited by direct invitation. Its monarchy, however, is less selective than Piel’s in bestowing titles on its subjects. For a modest £29.99, “official” documents signed by current reigning monarch Prince Regent Michael guarantee instant ennoblement as Lord, Lady, Baron or Baroness of Sealand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21a57c77c4ab02db95abaac0a2f5b87b20bf02fb/220_0_2867_1722/master/2867.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=635b31f861b2d5aa03f377645364002f","title":"10 best books novels set in india indian writers","story":"Tired of narratives that obsess over spices, colours and cows on the road? These books, all by Indian writers, paint realistic pictures of the country’s geographical, cultural and political landscapes• Share your own suggestions in the comments belowWhen I researched my book Around India in 80 Trains, one of the small joys of my four-month railway adventure was idling on platforms and rummaging through the iconic old Wheeler stalls for paperbacks to keep me company. Sometimes I’d get conned with pirated copies, flicking hungrily to the last few pages only to find they were missing, or the final lines had slid off the photocopied page. But for the most part my rucksack was stacked with stories that shaped the curves of my journey.Tired of narratives that obsess over spices, colours and cows on the road, I’ve chosen books by Indian writers only after all, who knows a country better than its own people? Where the authors have used the old names of cities, I’ve done so too, in order to convey the duality of their nature: having spent a couple of years living in Madras as a child, I know the familiar emotions and memories that the name conjures up, whereas Chennai is a completely different city to me.“Return is never the experience you hope for,” Doshi begins, setting the tone for the story of Grace, a young woman coming back to Madras after her mother’s death, to find she has inherited a pink beach house down the coast – and a sister with Down’s syndrome. Small Days and Nights is a compelling story about family, which follows Grace as she slips between Madras, Kodaikanal and Paramankeni, her needs, wants and urges changing with her surroundings as she tries to reconcile desire with duty. A poet, dancer and novelist, Doshi centres the female body in all her work, and it’s through the weight of Grace’s legs, or the lightness in her bones that we, too, feel the effects of the “womb noise” of the sea in Paramankeni, the whiplash of Kodaikanal rain that “smells of sex”, and the dreamy transitional city of Madras, where the trees look weak and hungover.With characteristic brazenness, Thayil opens with a dedication to HCV – the hepatitis C virus that he contracted while sharing needles and injecting government morphine in the 1980s. It’s followed by a languorous six-page sentence that unfurls like smoke from a pipe – a prelude to a powerhouse of a novel about Bombay’s old opium dens. Built from brutality and grouted together with beauty, Narcopolis begins as a homage to a city of harmony and acceptance, celebrating Bombay as the hero of the story – a sanctuary for Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Parsis and Christians – then morphs into an epitaph of a city “which obliterated its own history by changing its name and surgically altering its face”.Shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2012, Thayil refuses to use “Mumbai”, a name that was forced upon its residents by the far-right Hindu Shiv Sena party, and his affection for his former home makes this a potent love letter to the island city and its dead.Like a succession of quick slaps across the face, the opening lines of each story of this debut collection make you sit up and take full notice. Parachuting the reader straight in through low-hanging quilts of cloud, Pariat drops us between the plump tea bushes in and around the hill station of Shillong, where it’s cold and damp and mists swirl with the supernatural. Here, in the furthest reaches of India’s north-eastern fingertips, we learn about Khasi politics and culture, but always with a sense of unease – where the night is “slashed by lightning”, “knifed with light”, and the sky “the colour of razor blades”. Beginning with the days of British rule and stretching up to a modern-day marital infidelity, each of the 15 stories is written in seamless prose that doesn’t jolt or falter through italics or apologetic explanations of bilati, doh thli and jadoh. If you don’t know their meanings it’s up to you to look them up.Adiga upset many middle-class Indians when The White Tiger hit their bookshelves like a sledgehammer, winning him the Booker prize. Written from the perspective of Balram, the son of a rickshaw puller, the book is a series of letters that he writes feverishly, but never sends, to the soon-to-be-visiting Chinese premier, documenting his wily ascent from tea boy to wealthy entrepreneur. Through his sharp-eyed, witty and frenzied descriptions, Adiga doesn’t just highlight the brutal injustices and corruption of Indian society but slaps them across the paper in broad, bushy strokes. Although the book was released in 2008, one line stands out for its relevance today: “One fact about India is that you can take almost anything that you hear about the country from the prime minister and turn it upside down and then you will have the truth about that thing.”Not many novels are set in Bangalore, the more subdued sibling of Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata. However, here we find Shalini, a 24-year-old numbed by the banality of her privileged life in the Garden City. Since her mother’s death, three years earlier, she’s lived in limbo, unable to commit to anything and plagued by a memory from her childhood of a Kashmiri man appearing twice at their garden gate. In a feverish moment she decides to leave home to find him, swapping her weekend trips to Bali, and beer-sticky house parties, for the blue-grey mountains of Kashmir, where the air is tinged with the “medicinal sharpness of pine sap” and waterfalls churn to a “filigreed white froth”.Vijay’s beautiful debut leaps back and forth while shining a light on a politically fractious region from the perspective of a civilian – that, too, a single woman traipsing the length of India alone in search of the unknown.The only non-fiction on this list, this collection strings together nine stories gathered along the Indian coast, from Bengal to Gujarat. With fish as the starting point, Subramanian examines its role in food, medicine, culture and religion by talking to everyone he meets on his haphazard travels, from Goan fishermen and priests, to Kolkata hotel chefs and a faith-healing family in Hyderabad. Dense and rigorous journalism, the writing ignites when the author sits down to eat: whether he’s tasting raw fish podi made from powdered mackerel that “races to the back of the throat and proceeds to set your tonsils on fire”, or sampling toddy-shop food that is typically “kicked into a high orbit of spice”, it’s hard to resist the urge to follow in his footsteps.The first Indian woman to win the Booker, Roy caused a storm in the literary world when her lyrical debut was published in 1997, spurring a number of authors who tried to emulate her style, while others decried her success – the sure sign of a good book.Set in Kerala – known as God’s Own Country, for its vast backwaters, bent palms and cool greenery – the book opens in the brooding heat of May, when bananas ripen, jackfruits burst and crows devour the mangoes, before the monsoon breaks, tiny fish appear in puddles and “bullfrogs cruise for mates”. Tragedy has destroyed a family, and after many years an estranged pair of twins are reuniting where it all began.Scattering capital letters and pulling and playing around with language, Roy paints a vivid picture of Indian politics, the cruelty of caste, and the “small things” that keep us afloat.A hulking beast of a book, this delicious thriller sinks deep into Bombay’s criminal underworld, as Sikh cop Sartaj Singh goes after the infamous gangster Ganesh Gaitonde. Packed with policemen stroking splendid handlebar moustaches, lapdogs being hurled from balconies, and villains with bulging, bloodshot eyes, Sacred Games is a brilliant exploration of politics, history and corruption. For the unfamiliar, it is also a swift education in the peculiarities of the city’s various districts, like Bandra, Tardeo and Dadar, offering peeks into the homes of Bombay’s rich, “30,000 square feet of Italian marble floors tied together with intercoms”, and the poor – where residents have no choice but to “let their little daughters squat to make a mess exactly where their sons played”.Published in 2006, the novel is now a wildly popular series on Netflix.Few novels begin with the sheer horror of this one: a horror that rises from the belly, making you gasp and catch your breath before turning the page.It is Calcutta in the 1960s and the wealthy son of a paper-mill owner has abandoned the Ghosh family to join a Maoist rebellion, helping farmers to fight their landlords while his Tolstoyan array of relatives deal with their own multitude of tribulations. Shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2014, this is a tome of extraordinary reach and richness, written by an author whose gift lies not just in his ability to imagine the lives of others but to embody them: he details how those starving outside a luxury hotel will hunt for a “stub of banana” left in a peel, while in the affluent world a whole family is “caught up in a song-and-dance” in an attempt to get food down a fussy toddler.If we’re being technical, this 2006 Booker prize-winner oscillates between the Himalayan foothills of West Bengal and the basement kitchens of New York, following the lives of a judge, his granddaughter, her maths tutor, their cook and his son. But the Indian backdrop could almost be a sixth character, where the trees are “moss-slung giants, bunioned and misshapen”, and Mount Kanchenjunga looms with a “wizard phosphorescence”. Desai takes on a mammoth endeavour in linking these seemingly disparate lives, but does so with panache while also being incredibly funny. She exposes one generation suffering from a crisis of identity owing to colonialism – Judge Jemubhai Patel eating chapatis with a knife and fork – and another generation still looking to the west for a better future… while sharing a bed in shifts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd9b89a871fc5d85c59b9f91c9f3544cb0c147a7/0_0_5920_3947/master/5920.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=825c82647fc1e98167fdfc7de5758746 720w","title":"lynchings report reconstruction era black americans","story":"The killings during the 12-year period adds to the 4,400 victims from the post-Reconstruction era of 1877 to 1950, bringing the total number of people lynched to 6,500When George King, a black man in South Carolina, was freed from slavery by the 13th amendment to the US constitution in 1865, his former slave owner came to him to clarify how things were going to work from now on.“The Master, he says we are all free,” King later recalled. “But it don’t mean we is white. And it don’t mean we is equal.”The true horror of those words, and the blast of racial terrorism such sentiments ignited across the deep south in the immediate aftermath of the civil war, are laid bare in a harrowing new report by the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI).The report, Reconstruction in America, documents more than 2,000 black victims of racial terror lynchings killed between the end of the civil war in 1865 and the collapse of federal efforts to protect the lives and voting rights of black Americans in 1876.In that brief 12-year period, known as Reconstruction, a reign of terror was unleashed by Confederate veterans and former slave owners in a brazen effort to keep black people enslaved in all but name. Technically freed slaves were lynched at an average rate of almost one every two days – putting paid to the hope that Emancipation offered millions of black people and effectively terrorizing them into submission.The report is a prequel to EJI’s groundbreaking 2015 research that identified and recorded more than 4,400 black victims of racial terror lynchings from the post-Reconstruction period, 1877 to 1950. The new report allows that grim tally to be further expanded with the addition of the 2,000 documented victims from the Reconstruction era itself – bringing the total number of documented cases of black people who were supposedly free yet were lynched in the most sadistic fashion to a staggering 6,500 men, women and children.EJI notes that its newly revised toll of racial terror lynchings in America is likely to underestimate the total by hundreds or even thousands given gross underreporting of racial violence and widespread efforts to suppress the truth.Bryan Stevenson, EJI’s executive director, told the  that the new report highlights the capitulation and complicity of American institutions – from local sheriffs right up to the US supreme court in Washington – in the face of white supremacist violence. “It’s one of the few times in American history where there is an almost complete concession to lawlessness and an abandonment of constitutional protections,” Stevenson said.He added: “That explains much of the moment we are now in – until there is a deep reckoning of this history of violence and racial oppression we cannot repair and remedy, and without that we are not going to be able to create the society we want.”The light shone by EJI on the brutal events of Reconstruction comes at a critically important time for racial justice in America. The country is in the grip of protests following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, with demonstrations in more than 750 US cities demanding change.It also follows the shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia which has been called a modern-day lynching.The report lands just days before Juneteenth, Friday’s annual celebration to mark the day in 1865 when the emancipation proclamation was finally read out by Union soldiers in Texas – the last state in the Confederacy in which slaves were freed.Stevenson said that the outpouring of protest across the nation underlined the need for a historical reckoning. “We have to acknowledge what the damage is, tell the truth about the harm and injury, then we can begin to imagine what repair and remedy looks like. The truth has to come first – and we haven’t done that.”EJI’s new report depicts the paradox of how quickly the promise of freedom was stolen from freed black Americans. In the first flush of emancipation, more than 3 million black people living overwhelmingly in the south rushed to claim the benefits of citizenship.Black representation followed, with some 2,000 black men holding elected office during Reconstruction. In 1870 Hiram Revels from Mississippi took a seat in the US Senate, the first African American to serve in Congress.Such an extraordinary surge of black political participation was matched, however, by an equal and opposite surge of white violence designed to put black people back in the box. On 24 December 1865, less than three weeks after the 13th amendment was ratified abolishing slavery, six former Confederate leaders came together to form the first chapter of the Ku Klux Klan and began what WEB Du Bois described as “armed guerilla warfare”. Appalling acts of sadistic homicidal terrorism, targeted frequently against nascent black leaders who were at the forefront of the movement to claim the benefits of citizenship, were swift to follow.EJI has documented 34 mass lynchings during Reconstruction. The deadliest of them took place in the fall of 1868 in Opelousas, Louisiana, where an orgy of white violence over two weeks claimed the lives of 200 black people who were mercilessly hunted down through fields and swamps.It was no coincidence that what motivated the murderers was a desire to suppress black voter turnout in Opelousas in the run-up to the 1868 presidential election. Withholding the vote from the country’s new citizens was seen as a crucial means of reimposing white supremacy in the absence of the physical chains of slavery.Other acts of mass violence were committed against black people who had the audacity, after slavery was ended, to ask to be paid for their work in the fields. Still others were killed because they tried to leave the cotton plantations where they had been enslaved, or because they set up schools to teach black children how to read.Most of the violence occurred in the south but the north was not exempt or guiltless.The report honors the memory of Octavius Catto, an African American veteran of the Union army who worked hard to organize black citizens in Philadelphia. He was killed by a white supremacist in October 1871 as he was on his way back home having voted in a mayoral election.Stevenson thinks there is a powerful message of hope to emerge from the grim record of racial terrorism under Reconstruction. In 12 short years, the white supremacists managed through a whirlwind of violence to change the entire course of American history – putting the country on the path towards inequality and discrimination under which it still labors today.“If they could do so much in 12 years, why can’t we? In 12 years we could change the entire direction of the country. If we engage in a vigorous, committed effort of truth telling and repair, we might create a new century where things are very different.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f9c2a6699500e3b01e3fa2000ae3a005c24bb73/0_126_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ea85962d6c47c16385dba59578c0dbe","title":"dismay over adviser chosen set up uk race inequality commission munira mirza","story":"Munira Mirza has doubted existence of institutional racism and criticised ‘culture of grievance’The new government commission on racial inequalities is being set up by a No 10 adviser who has cast doubt on the existence of institutional racism and condemned previous inquiries for fostering a “culture of grievance”, it has emerged.Munira Mirza, the head of the No 10 policy unit, is leading much of the work to form the commission on race and ethnic disparities announced by Boris Johnson on Sunday after the global wave of Black Lives Matter protests, the  has been told.It is understood that Mirza has said she hopes to recruit Trevor Phillips as part of the commission. Phillips, a former chair of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, would be a controversial choice, having previously referred to UK Muslims as being “a nation within a nation”.When Phillips was named as playing a role in a Public Health England inquiry into the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, it prompted condemnation from campaigners.The revelation of Mirza’s role was met with dismay from experts and MPs. The shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, whose own review on inequalities in the judicial system was criticised by Mirza, tweeted on Monday evening that the appointment “further undermines” Johnson’s race commission.The Labour MP added: “My review was welcomed by all parties: Corbyn, Cameron and May. But Munira Mirza went out of her way to attack it. Johnson isn’t listening to #BlackLivesMatter. He’s trying to wage a culture war.”The Institute of Race Relations thinktank said it would be hard to have confidence in the commission’s outcomes.“Any enquiry into inequality has to acknowledge structural and systemic factors. Munira Mirza’s previous comments describe a ‘grievance culture’ within the anti-racist field and she has previously argued that institutional racism is ‘a perception more than a reality’,” a spokesperson said. “It is difficult to have any confidence in policy recommendations from someone who denies the existence of the very structures that produce the social inequalities experienced by black communities.”The Labour MP Diane Abbott, a former shadow home secretary, said: “A new race equalities commission led by Munira Mirza is dead on arrival. She has never believed in institutional racism.”The government commission, which was revealed in a Daily  column by Johnson, was also condemned by Labour as overly vague, “written on the back of a fag packet” and adding delay rather than urgency.Mirza, who is also understood to be leading efforts to recruit commission members, has been an outspoken critic of previous government attempts to tackle structural factors behind racial inequality.She condemned an audit of racial inequalities in public services commissioned by Theresa May, which No 10 say will form part of the basis of the new commission. Writing for the Spectator in 2017, Mirza said the audit showed how “anti-racism is becoming weaponised across the political spectrum”.In the same article, Mirza criticised two other reports which Johnson’s government has promised to act on: the one written by Lammy when he was a backbencher, and another on unequal pay among ethnic groups. Mirza said both showed “wrongheaded thinking about race”.Dawn Butler, a Labour MP and former equalities minister, said Mirza’s role “undermines its credibility from the very outset by appointing someone who stands by Johnson’s racist comments, rejected the Lammy review, saying ‘institutional racism’ is ‘a perception more than a reality’, and opposed Theresa May’s very own racial disparities audit.“I am tired of fighting the government on this issue. The only review needed is a review into all the past consultations and reviews as well as their failure to implement over 200 prior recommendations.”Zubaida Haque, the interim director of the Runnymede Trust, a leading race equality thinktank, said the prime minister bore ultimate responsibility for the commission, however. “There are several members in this government who were not strong supporters of Theresa May’s race disparity audit including Munira Mirza, Boris Johnson’s own adviser in No 10. But we must remember that it’s the prime minister who’s in charge here and it’s the prime minister who needs to be held accountable for his words and actions, not his advisers.”Johnson announced the commission in two lines of an article for Monday’s  otherwise devoted to arguing against the removal of historical statues and condemning protesters, and in brief TV comments that referenced a desire to end “the sense of victimisation”, which were described by critics as unhelpful.No 10 said later it would “look at wider inequalities, including issues faced by working-class white boys in schools, for example”. Its remit and members will be announced in due course, a spokesman said. The report, which will also examine some non-racial inequalities, will be completed by the end of the year.Speaking to the BBC on Monday morning, Lammy condemned the plan as overly vague, and a way to delay implementing recommendations from his and other reports. “It’s because this was written on the back of a fag packet yesterday, to assuage the BLM protests,” he said. “Get on with the action. Legislate. Move. You’re in government – do something.”Simon Woolley, the director of Operation Black Vote and chair of the government’s Race Disparity Unit advisory group, also warned the commission must implement existing recommendations rather than going over old ground.“This should not be a fact-finding inquiry,” said the crossbench peer. “This should be framing a comprehensive action plan to reform those key areas that Boris Johnson has acknowledged that have systemic racism.”Mirza, a one-time supporter of the Revolutionary Communist party, who spent eight years as Johnson’s deputy mayor for culture in London, has been an outspoken critic of anti-racism and what she called “its culture of grievance”.In the Spectator article, she took issue with Lammy’s review into the justice system by saying that in some ways, people from BAME backgrounds have “more favourable treatment compared with whites”.In a blogpost from 2018, Mirza argued that injustices were only treated seriously if there was “a social justice angle that can be ined (or manufactured)”.These views chime to an extent with Johnson’s attempts to reframe the debate about the mass protests after the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis in terms of opposition to removing statues, and his view that more should be done to talk up positive experiences about race.“What I feel most strongly is that there are so many positive stories that are not being heard,” he told reporters in Downing Street on Monday. “Things really are changing. You’re seeing young black kids now doing better in some of the most difficult subjects in school than they were ever before, more going to top universities.”Addressing MPs in the Commons, the home secretary, Priti Patel, confirmed the government was backing a plan by some Tory MPs for a new law imposing heavier prison sentences on protesters who vandalise war memorials, after a statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square was defaced during a BLM demonstration.This prompted counter-demonstrators, including those from far-right groups, to protest in Westminster on Saturday. Patel said about 2,000 “racist and far-right hooligans” attended, some of whom threw smoke bombs at police.Patel said more than 210,000 people attended demonstrations across the country over the weekend at about 160 protests.Asked about Mirza’s role and the concerns around it, a No 10 source highlighted Johnson’s comments on Tuesday about the value of the commission’s work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/734140b864b6c3b9eb57926b4d388ec0eab6ef98/0_414_5527_3316/master/5527.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efc5a7f2f1f208c79fc6781ebb1bcda5","title":"eu discuss greater defence cooperation us china tensions","story":"European leaders fear two powers are becoming embroiled in permanent confrontationEU ministers are to discuss the need for greater defence cooperation and a renewed intelligence assessment in the face of a heightened risk of a China-US military confrontation.The call for greater EU defence cooperation comes in a Franco-German joint paper and, although familiar, has been given added urgency by fears in the bloc that the US and China will become locked in a permanent big power confrontation.The paper, due to be discussed by EU defence ministers on Tuesday and first obtained by Bloomberg News, says defence integration is necessitated by “the return of power competition and confrontation and the ensuing threat to the rules-based international order”.The memo proposes that the EU’s intelligence arm should produce a classified threat assessment by the end of the year, on the basis of which it can decide on how to enhance its joint capabilities in the future, in areas ranging from peacekeeping to space and cybersecurity.The EU has launched several initiatives to deepen its defence integration in the past, including by encouraging greater joint defence procurement, so reducing duplication, but the shift towards integration has become more pronounced after the bloc’s initially stumbling joint response to coronavirus.The intelligence assessment will mark a moment after the US presidential elections for the EU to assess the risk of a deep strategic conflict.The EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, at the same time said the bloc would launch a bilateral dialogue with the US on the challenges posed by a more assertive China in an effort to reach a common understanding. Borrell was speaking after EU foreign ministers held a virtual two-hour meeting with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, covering the main points of dispute between them including China and the potential Israeli annexation of Palestinian territory on the West Bank.Borrell has said the tension between China and the US has become the main axis of current global politics and the pressure on the EU to “select a side” among the two is increasing.Borrell said: “We as Europe must find our own independent way of doing things, even though this will bring various challenges.” But some EU states say it is inconceivable in terms of values for the EU to be equidistant between China and the US.Borrell is known to be resistant to talk of a new cold war, arguing all the big issues on trade and the climate crisis require Chinese cooperation. At the same time, the EU shares US frustration at the lack of access to Chinese markets, and the role of Chinese state companies.EU policymakers are also worried that the US is about to impose a form of extra-territorial sanction by blacklisting European companies that cooperate with the Chinese state telecommunications company Huawei.The US and EU bilateral dialogue will instead try to find more limited areas of cooperation by pressing China to do more to open access to markets and by resisting sensitive security investments.Borrell said the mood of the meeting was not one in which Pompeo either accepted or rejected the EU point of view, adding he was sure the secretary of state would have been aware of the internal differences within the union."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f60ae5339f0d5c8fa6d112c838ce4c9959dfb0e/0_5_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8a6f18b7153d12b305e850300f27e38","title":"hydroxychloroquine coronavirus fda emergency authorization","story":"Food and Drug Administration says drug is unlikely to work against coronavirus and notes heart risksUS regulators revoked the emergency authorization for malaria drugs championed by Donald Trump for treating Covid-19, amid growing evidence they don’t work and could cause serious side effects.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said on Monday the drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were unlikely to be effective in treating the coronavirus. Citing reports of heart complications, the agency said the drugs’ unproven benefits “do not outweigh the known and potential risks”.Trump criticized the FDA decision. “I took it and I felt good about taking it. I don’t know if it had an impact, but it certainly didn’t hurt me,” Trump said on Monday.Trump said there had been “great reports” out of France, Spain and other places, without offering any evidence or further explanation. France is one of the countries that has already stopped using the drug for Covid-19 patients.In a separate announcement, the FDA also warned doctors against prescribing the drugs in combination with remdesivir, the lone drug currently shown to help patients with Covid-19. The agency said the anti-malaria drugs could reduce the effectiveness of remdesivir, which the FDA cleared for emergency use in May.Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are frequently prescribed for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.The FDA granted emergency use for the anti-malaria drugs in late March at the same time the US government accepted 30m doses of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine that had been donated by two foreign drug manufacturers. Millions of those doses were shipped to US hospitals to treat patients who weren’t enrolled in clinical trials.Meanwhile, no large, rigorous studies have found the drugs safe or effective for preventing or treating Covid-19. And a string of recent studies made clear they could do more harm than good.The drugs can cause heart rhythm problems, severely low blood pressure and muscle or nerve damage. The FDA reported on Monday that it had received nearly 390 reports of complications with the drugs, including more than 100 involving serious heart problems. Such reports represent an incomplete snapshot of complications with the drugs because many side effects go unreported.The FDA’s move means that shipments of the drugs obtained by the federal government will no longer be distributed to state and local health authorities for use against the coronavirus. The decades-old drugs are still available for alternative FDA-approved uses.Dr Steven Nissen, a Cleveland Clinic researcher who has been a frequent FDA adviser, agreed with the decision and said he would not have granted emergency access in the first place.“There has never been any high-quality evidence suggesting that hydroxychloroquine is effective” for treating or preventing coronavirus infection, he said, but there was evidence of serious side effects.In March, Trump said hydroxychloroquine used in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin had “a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine”, with little evidence to back up that claim.He later said he took the drugs preventively after two people who worked at the White House were diagnosed with Covid-19, and he urged others to try it.After Trump’s repeated promotions, prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine soared, contributing to shortages.The only remaining drug with FDA authorization against Covid-19 is remdesivir, an intravenous medication from Gilead Sciences that has been shown to help severely ill, hospitalized patients recover faster."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/596dd433f803f24c83967425d001eeb7dc1a0ade/3_440_3810_2285/master/3810.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cfb52b6e680f8df22e518f34304c08d","title":"iran bans vasectomies and contraceptives to improve birth rate","story":"Government move to boost birth rate does not affect pharmacies or private hospitalsIran’s state hospitals and clinics are no longer performing vasectomies or giving out contraceptives in an attempt to revive flagging population growth, a senior health official has told state media.Iranian women were now having 1.7 children on average, well below the 2.2 required to maintain the population, Hamed Barakati, director general of the Ministry of Health’s Office of Population and Family Health, told the Islamic Republic News Agency in an interview on Sunday. On current trends about a third of the country would be over 60 years old by 2050. “Whether we like it or not … we will become an ageing country,” he said.Family planning procedures and products would continue to be available from pharmacies and private hospitals, however, and in public hospitals to women whose life was at risk, Barakati said.Conservatives in Iran’s government, including the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have been pushing citizens to have more children for at least a decade, by limiting access to family planning services, increasing the number of infertility clinics and telling Iranians it is safe to have children every 18 to 24 months – down from earlier advice to wait three to five years. Maternity leave was extended to nine months and fathers given two weeks off as part of a suite of reforms in 2013.Yet birth rates have kept falling, which Barakati blamed on poor economic conditions that deterred men from committing to marriage and a family. “The young man will not be willing to marry or have children, even if we give him a loan, as long has he does not feel secure,” he said.Women delaying marriage to pursue higher education as well as a cultural aversion to having more than two children were also factors the government needed to address, he added. The average Iranian has her first child at 29, compared to around age 26 for an American.Hardliners have made the birth rate a national security issue and claimed foreign enemies have helped engineer the decline. Demography researchers have been arrested and accused of manipulating fertility statistics to try to hide the scale of the “population crisis”, according to state media.Khamenei has cast the falling birth rate as the result of imported western thinking and said the country of 80 million should aspire to a population nearly twice that size.Iran was lauded in the late 1990s for family planning policies that slashed the country’s birth rate from around seven children per woman in 1980 to fewer than two by 2011.It did so with progressive initiatives including subsidised vasectomies, free condoms and cheap contraceptives, and countrywide education on sexual health and family planning with the slogans “Two children is enough” and “Fewer kids, better life”.The falling fertility rates were encouraged by the country’s clerical rulers who worried that massive population growth during the 1980s – when families were encouraged to strengthen the wartorn country by producing “soldiers for Islam” – would stretch resources and lead to high unemployment in the future.Public-health officials have also warned that attempts to fight Aids and other sexually transmitted diseases would be set back by restricting condoms and other contraceptives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a86620c915a2f8dadb06b30384370bf0790b90e/1221_872_2424_1454/master/2424.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6cf7e71c52c9532ddae6180ec0769ab","title":"the stranded babies of kyiv and the women who give birth for money","story":"Lockdown exposed the scale of the commercial baby business in Ukraine, and now women hired for their wombs are speaking outSome are crying in their cots others are being cradled or bottle-fed by nannies. These newborns are not in the nursery of a maternity hospital, they are lined up side by side in two large reception rooms of the improbably named Hotel Venice on the outskirts of Kyiv, protected by outer walls and barbed wire.\u0026nbspThey are the children of foreign couples born to Ukrainian surrogate mothers at the Kyiv-based BioTexCom Centre for Human Reproduction, the largest surrogacy clinic in the world. They’re stranded in the hotel because their biological parents have not been able to travel in or out of Ukraine since borders closed in March because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Anxious parents check on the children they have not yet met via video calls, and others have sent audio recordings of their voices to soothe the children. BioTexCom released video footage from the hotel in mid-May to highlight the heartbreaking dilemma for parents and to lobby for an easing of border closures.The babies’ plight made headlines around the world,\u0026nbspbut a month on, some 50 babies remain in the hotel and the saga is casting a harsh spotlight on the ethics and scale of the booming commercial child-bearing industry in Ukraine.Mykola Kuleba, Ukraine’s ombudsman for children, has now said reforming a system he described as a violation of children’s rights was not enough and that surrogacy services for foreign couples in Ukraine should be banned.In a cash-strapped economy however, where the average wage is £300 a month and the war with Russia and its proxies continues, many impoverished women, especially in small towns and rural areas, are still lining up to carry babies for money, even if they are paying a heavy health and psychological price, as campaigners believe.In Vinnytsia, a city south-west of Kyiv, Liudmyla is still waiting to receive the balance of her fee for giving birth to a baby girl for a German couple in February. She regularly texts her surrogacy agency (not BioTexCom), which she says owes her €6,000. “They keep telling me they can’t send the entire sum because of the lockdown,” she says.\u0026nbspThough Liudmyla, 39, had an embryo transfer in Kyiv and spent most of her pregnancy in Vinnytsia, the agency asked her to travel to Poland to give birth so that the baby could be registered there. Hospital personnel were not aware that Liudmyla was a surrogate mother because commercial surrogacy is banned in Poland, as it is in most of Europe.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“I didn’t want to give her away, I was crying,” Liudmyla recalls. She says that after two days of caring for the infant in the maternity ward, letting her go was a wrench. “But I knew what it was all about.”\u0026nbspA shop assistant and a single mother, Luidmyla struggled for years to find a home for herself and her own three children that would be better than the one room in a hostel that they had. So in 2017 she went to a surrogacy clinic, and with the money she was able to take out a mortgage on an apartment. Even though she was placed in an intensive care unit as a result of complications in the pregnancy, Liudmyla decided to have a second surrogate baby to pay back most of the loan for the flat.\u0026nbspThere are no official statistics, but it is estimated that several thousand children are born to surrogate mothers in Ukraine each year.\u0026nbspEighty per cent of these babies are for foreign couples, who choose Ukraine because the process is legal and cheap.\u0026nbspSergii Antonov, a fertility lawyer, says Ukrainian surrogate agencies occasionally organise for the babies to be born abroad because this can make the birth registration process easier.The price of a surrogacy package in Ukraine starts from £25,000, with the surrogate mother receiving at least £10,000. Intended parents are generally required to be married heterosexual couples and to have proof of their infertility diagnosis. Surrogacy clinics and agencies place their ads in newspapers, on public transport or in social media groups.Tetiana Shulzhynska, 38, writes to such groups, trying to persuade women to stay away from surrogacy because she thinks some of them end up paying with their health or even their lives. “In a contract, they protect only babies, they don’t care about us,” she says, sitting on a bed in her tiny wooden house in Chernihiv, in northern Ukraine.\u0026nbspShulzhynska, a mother of two who used to work as a trolley bus conductor, went to a surrogacy clinic in 2013 because she desperately needed to pay back a bank loan. She was so broke that the clinic sent her money to buy the ticket to Kyiv.She agreed to carry a baby for an Italian couple, and within two months it turned out she had four living embryos in her womb. The biological family decided to keep only one and the rest were removed surgically. In May 2014 Shulzhynska gave birth to a baby girl, which she gave away to the parents. She received a fee of €9,000.\u0026nbspSeven months later she went to a hospital with severe stomach pain. Doctors diagnosed cervical cancer. It took her almost a year to raise money for surgery. Shulzhynska suspects the cancer was caused by her surrogacy, although there is no proof of this.\u0026nbspShe has recently ordered crutches because her doctors plan to amputate her left leg, which is now affected by the spreading cancer.In 2015, Shulzhynska filed a complaint against BioTexCom alleging damage caused to her health, which led to a criminal investigation that is ongoing.Yuriy Kovalchuk, a former state prosecutor whose office oversaw a series of criminal investigations into BioTexCom in 2018 and 2019, says at least three other women went to law enforcement after having their wombs removed following surrogate pregnancies organised by the company.He says other investigations involved allegations of fraud and even a human trafficking inquiry in 2016, after an Italian couple discovered in 2011 that the children they had taken home were not genetically related to them. Kovalchuk was removed from his post last year and believes the investigations into BioTexCom have stalled as a result. He wrote to the ombudsman’s office in May outlining his concerns about the clinic.At Hotel Venice, Albert Tochilovsky, the owner of BioTexCom, does not deny there were mix-ups with embryos during surrogacy procedures in 2011 that led to the human trafficking investigation.He blames the error on a lack of experience when the clinic was only a year old, and says: “I don’t think it was only us who used to make mistakes here. If someone starts checking DNA, there will be a lot of scandals.” \u0026nbspHe claims that in at least three cases parents rejected surrogate babies after they were born with health problems. The best-known of them is the case of Bridget, the daughter of an American couple, who was born in 2016 and now lives in an orphanage in Zaporizhia, in eastern Ukraine. “It was a tragedy for us,” Tochilovsky says.\u0026nbspThe company’s website advertises “the best surrogate mothers” and Tochilovsky denies mistreatment of any women or any fraud at his clinic. He dismisses Shulzhynska’s cancer claims as “nonsense” and says the firm gives contractual protection to surrogate mothers.Surrogate mothers are self-organising on social media, where they share advice and warnings about surrogacy agencies. Svitlana Sokolova, a former surrogate mother and now an activist at the NGO Strength of Mothers, which helps surrogates, says she started receiving more complaints about alleged mistreatment during the Covid lockdown. One group of women said their contract obliged them to keep having embryos implanted in their wombs for a year until they got pregnant. “Through this contract, the women became a kind of property,” she says.Maryna Lehenka, a lawyer at La Strada Ukraine, says the charity’s hotline gets around 100 calls a year from surrogate mothers complaining about the stress they experience after giving away babies or problems caused by the hormones they took to increase the chances of pregnancy. She recalls a case when a woman went into hiding in a village because she did not want to give away a surrogate baby. Lehenka agrees with the ombudsman that commercial surrogacy should be banned in Ukraine. Sokolova, who co-owns a surrogacy agency, argues instead for a proper legal framework that would protect the surrogates. “Otherwise, it will just go underground.”Despite pressure for regulation of the surrogacy business – there are several draft laws before parliament – experts and insiders doubt major legal changes will be made anytime soon to curb the baby business. Tochilovsky says that if commercial surrogacy became illegal, his clinic would just refocus on embryo donation.\u0026nbsp“The world’s future is in biotechnology, and most of the money will come into biotechnologies,” he says.Olga, 26, is going to have her second set of surrogate twin boys for a Chinese couple later this month. To give birth, she came to Kyiv from a town in north-east Ukraine along with her young son and husband, and was placed by the agency in a new flat within walking distance of the maternity hospital. Olga says she is feeling fine and she meets sometimes with three other pregnant surrogate mothers living nearby. Using the $17,000 (£13,500) she will get for the babies, Olga wants to open a coffee shop or a flower boutique back home. “I didn’t kill, I didn’t steal, I made this money in an honest way,” she says. Her son sits next to her he calls the expected babies “Kirusha and Kirusha”.\u0026nbspThe only worry Olga has is whether the biological parents will arrive before the twins’ birth. Otherwise, she will have to look after the babies until the parents come. Sokolova says some surrogates have ended up looking after their babies for months. She recalls one case where a surrogate mother adopted a baby after the biological parents rejected it at the last moment.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, new babies born to surrogates arrive at BioTexCom almost daily and are placed in the hotel’s makeshift nursery.\u0026nbspA group of Argentinian and Spanish couples, some of whom travelled before lockdown, were joyously united with their babies last week, but it is not yet clear when Ukraine’s borders will officially reopen and to which countries.Rafael Aires, from Spain, carefully takes his daughter Marta from the baby room to play with her. Aires arrived in Ukraine before the lockdown and has been held up for months, his wife back in Spain. But the complication has not tarnished the couple’s happiness. Aires had been trying for a baby for eight years. “And now,” he says, “ta-dam.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/205bc504825c4cf8e771c994e0f05d837e654d60/0_93_1400_840/master/1400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0997edd05a3a61b6b807d2efdac20a3","title":"coronavirus vaccine trial by imperial college london begins","story":"Professor says early vaccines may not stop virus being contracted but prevent recipients developing severe Covid-19 illnessResearchers at Imperial College London will this week begin clinical trials of a possible coronavirus vaccine in 300 people.The healthy participants, aged between 18 and 70, will all receive two doses of the vaccine over the coming weeks, and the hopes is that tests could then move on to 6,000 volunteers if there is an effective immune response.Rather than giving people a weakened form of the illness, the Imperial vaccine instead uses synthetic strands of genetic code based on the genetic material of Sars-CoV-2, the “novel coronavirus” responsible for the pandemic.Robin Shattock, the Imperial College London professor leading its development, has told Bloomberg that early protective vaccines might not completely stop a person contracting the virus. “Is that protection against infection? Is it protection against illness? Is it protection against severe disease? It’s quite possible a vaccine that only protects against severe disease would be very useful.”When injected, the Imperial experimental vaccine instructs muscle cells to produce virus proteins to protect against future infection. In animal tests, the vaccine was shown to be safe and showed “encouraging signs of an effective immune response”, Shattock’s team said.The research has been funded by £41m from the UK government, as well as £5m of other donations, and comes after a separate vaccine from experts at Oxford University started undergoing human clinical trials.With Press Association and Reuters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53c75310eaa7a20a87e57b9fd2d161e2f8dae72d/0_147_4489_2693/master/4489.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=00ed4a0b2df59563e0746a6cbf75ecde","title":"new zealand records first new covid 19 cases after women arrive from uk carrying virus","story":"Pair drove nearly 650km to visit dying parent after being released early from quarantine but officials claim public were not are at riskNew Zealand has recorded its first new cases of coronavirus for 24 days after two women who arrived in the country from Britain were found to be infected.The pair were released early from government quarantine and permitted to drive from the city of Auckland to Wellington, the capital – nearly 650km away – before being diagnosed or even tested, health officials said.Their trip was an approved exemption from the mandatory isolation period for new arrivals to the country in order to visit a dying parent. The women had “done everything right” and had not put other members of the public at risk, said Ashley Bloomfield, New Zealand’s director-general of health, on Tuesday.But the news of the women’s travel forced the government to suspend its policy of granting compassionate exemptions to its quarantine rules.“It will only be reinstated once the government has confidence in the system,” said David Clark, the health minister, in a statement. Officials had already announced that no one in future would be permitted to leave quarantine facilities without a negative Covid-19 test, as the women had.After both women tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, one reported that in hindsight she had been experiencing symptoms, but had attributed them to a pre-existing medical condition.The pair mark New Zealand’s first new cases of Covid-19 for more than three weeks, and were diagnosed one week after the last known case in the country had recovered.The discovery of the new cases came one week after all domestic restrictions on the country were lifted, with Bloomfield warning at the time that more cases of the virus would inevitably arise as people infected with it crossed the border.The women – one aged in her 30s and the other in her 40s – had arrived in Auckland on a flight from the UK via Brisbane, Australia, on 7 June, Bloomfield said. All new arrivals to the country – only New Zealanders, their families, and essential workers are currently permitted to cross the border – are required to spend two weeks in managed isolation at a hotel.But six days after the women arrived, Bloomfield said they travelled from Auckland to Wellington “in a private vehicle” after they were granted a compassionate exemption to do so and made a safety plan with officials. They had not been tested for Covid-19 at the time.The pair had made the drive of approximately eight hours without refuelling their vehicle or disembarking for any reason, including to use public toilets, he said.“They had no contact with anybody else during that trip,” added Bloomfield.He was “not nervous” that the women had infected anyone else, adding that they would now remain in self-isolation with a relative in Wellington. Those permitted to leave the government-run isolation hotels on compassionate grounds are allowed to grieve with their families – but not to attend funerals.All those on the women’s Air New Zealand flight to Brisbane, including crew, as well as staff and guests at the Novotel Ellerslie hotel in Auckland – where they were initially in quarantine – including staff, would be tested and isolated.A guest at the same hotel – who was also in quarantine – told Television New Zealand that she had not been tested before she left the facility. Those in quarantine are meant to receive Covid-19 swabs on the third and 12th days of their 14-day isolation period. “I have asked the Director General to consider if there are any other measures we can put in place to strengthen our health protections at the border,” Clark, the health minister, said.But the women who were later diagnosed “did everything that was asked of them,” Bloomfield said, and it was “not surprising” that cases of the virus had entered New Zealand from the UK, where “active infections” remained.“We should not be complacent, we need to remain vigilant,” Bloomfield said. “There is a pandemic raging outside our shores.”The country has recorded less than 1,500 confirmed cases of Covid-19, and 22 deaths, after a strict and early national lockdown which has drawn praise for Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f6e2a5ff8e8eab2f51030a44f69015f16db5dc0/0_0_4668_2801/master/4668.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cd0a026d696fbb4112f54060056dc5f","title":"slipper revolution lukashenkos reign under pressure in belarus","story":"After decades in power, a bungled Covid-19 response has triggered a genuine electoral challengeViktor Babariko, an outspoken ex-banker, embodies elite discontent with Belarus’s Alexander Lukashenko and his 26 years at the head of Europe’s most authoritarian state.After decades out of politics, Babariko says he decided to mount a challenge and run for president this year both to oppose economic integration with Russia and because of the “totally irresponsible” handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Lukashenko refused to impose a lockdown, claimed that drinking vodka would keep the virus at bay and went ahead with a 9 May Victory Day parade involving thousands of soldiers and elderly war veterans.The country currently has 54,500 confirmed cases of Covid-19 – significantly more than the 29,700 in neighbouring Poland, which has four times its population.“The government has lost touch with reality. The response to Covid-19 was absolute evidence of that,” Babariko said in an interview. “They think that the Belarus that has lived so quietly and meekly for the last 26 years will continue. But the country that they think still exists is gone.”There are numerous factors for the discontent: a faltering economy, the bungled response to coronavirus, the growing reach of criticism through social media, an increasingly confident civil society – and exhaustion with a government that seems to have run out of ideas.“It became an explosive cocktail,” said Valeriya Kostyugova, the editor of the Minsk-based Nashe Mnenie, noting that coronavirus had helped bring the crisis to a head. “The focus turned considerably to the elections and to hopes of somehow getting rid of Lukashenko and his government system.”Among the usual run of puppet candidates who represent little threat to Lukashenko, real challengers have appeared. Establishment candidates such as Babariko and Valery Tsepkalo, a former ambassador to the US, indicate cracks in the elite. Sergei Tikhanovsky, a popular YouTuber with more than 235,000 subscribers, attracted thousands of Belarusians to events to collect signatures for his campaign under an anti-corruption slogan of “stop the cockroach”.Many supporters brought slippers, the preferred weapon to kill household pests, at Tikhanovsky’s suggestion. Some media have dubbed it the “slipper revolution”.Opinion polling is severely limited by the government but thousands have stood in mile-long queues to endorse the candidates, a political spectacle that observers say is unprecedented. “Lukashenko has managed to frustrate and irritate a lot of social groups,” said Artyom Shraibman, a Minsk-based political analyst, noting that the groundswell of opposition had helped expose the “myth” of Lukashenko’s popularity. “It’s a street protest but it’s also this middle-class drift into politics where people who never were political are now joining.”Perhaps unsurprisingly, Tikhanovsky, with an appeal to regional and working-class voters who may have previously supported Lukashenko, was arrested first. On Thursday, he was charged with violating public order and assaulting police at a rally to collect signatures in the city of Grodno, and may face up to three years in prison. Observers say he will likely be held until after the 9 August elections.“When he called and said he was going to run … I remember I replied ‘Sergei, you know how the presidential elections are going to end? In prison,’” said Alexander Kabanov, a blogger and activist who also serves as press secretary for the campaign.Tikhanovskay’s wife, Svetlana, has said she will try to register as a candidate but cancelled some events this week, saying in a video address that she was concerned about “provocations”.Lukashenko appears to be considering a larger crackdown. On the same day, investigators raided Babariko’s former bank, Belgazprombank, as well as several other connected businesses.“It’s touched clients. It’s touched my friends,” said Babariko. “This is a broad political persecution.”On Friday, MolaMola, a popular crowdfunding platform co-founded by Babariko’s son, had its operations blocked. The platform had been instrumental in helping raise money for doctors and anti-coronavirus efforts, and the move against it appeared to target a crucial platform for civil activism.Lukashenko has declared Belarus will not have a revolution and said that the upstart campaigns were being funded by Russian oligarchs, in what seemed a veiled reference to Babariko’s former employer. Belgazprombank is the local arm of Russia’s Gazprombank.“I see everything. The main things is not to worry,” Lukashenko told his elections chief in a meeting last week. “There will be no coup in this country. Nor will there be a Maidan,” he added, referring to the 2014 revolution in Ukraine.Analysts said Lukashenko’s attempts to normalise relations with the west, particularly during a period of tensions with Russia, which is putting pressure on Minsk to integrate the two countries in a “unified state”, could temper a potential crackdown, but that his desire for political survival would always come first.Babariko has cautiously avoided calls to protest but says they may break out “if the people feel deceived”, recalling the experiences of Czechoslovakia and Romania."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a8a2954aa278c80993805268898dcbc9a00d07c/0_0_929_557/master/929.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb7fffef3114b60a4fb1c5581de39aa0","title":"tuesday briefing covids toll on lungs vicious expert","story":"UK vaccine scientists begin human trials … family of Rayshard Brooks call for calm in BLM protests … and the cut-and-run trade of lockdown hairdressingHello, Warren Murray here to make sure you keep up with the pack.Prof Mauro Giacca of King’s College London has told parliament how he observed catastrophic damage to the lungs of people who died of Covid-19.

Differences remain, especially over “level playing field” conditions attached to a free trade agreement, fisheries, police cooperation and governance of the future agreement. After the meeting, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European commission, acknowledged that Michael Gove had formally notified the EU that the UK would not be seeking to extend the transition period.‘Golden state killer’ in plea deal – An ex-policeman in California charged as the “Golden State Killer” with 13 murders and as many kidnappings is expected to plead guilty to avoid execution, according to reports.

Here, three people who found their voices explain how you can do itIt should, these days, be easier than ever to make a point in public. If you want to tell your story there are places to blog and host videos, there is social media to help you find an audience, and free software and ever cheaper hardware to get you online.But in practice, not everyone finds it easy to push their ideas into a public space. So where do you begin, particularly if you feel as if you’re on the margins? As part of Levi’s Your Voice. Your Way campaign,  Labs talked to three young people who, driven by a burning desire to be heard, found their voices through blogging, podcasts and zines.This is their advice to others who are bubbling with ideas and opinions, who know they have something valuable to say, but may feel unchampioned or underestimated. These are the first steps to getting your voice heard ...1. Stay true to yourselfYou might admire a particular columnist or an influencer, but the world doesn’t need an exact copy of someone else. The world needs you.“I tried lots of voices on for size, but they weren’t really me,” says Jessica Riches, a social media and content specialist. She found her real voice and honed her social media skills during the student protests of 2010 when she became the clearest online voice of the group who occupied University College London in protest at increases in fees.“Politics was where I found myself,” she says. “I was able to learn and explore that side of myself and I found a community of people.”For Raifa Rafiq, a shared interest in books led her to create the Mostly Lit podcast with her friend Alex Reads. “The response we got was phenomenal,” she says of the podcast, which ran for four years, won awards and partnered with Waterstones. “We did something we enjoyed and ended up putting a different face on culture and arts criticism: you don’t have to be an old white man or a middle class white woman to love books or to talk about them.”2. Consider your platform carefullyWho do you want to reach and what are you trying to say? Both of these questions will have an effect on where and how you publish your work. “In terms of social media, this is key,” says Riches. “If you are telling a story that is text based, about news or opinion, then head to Twitter. If you want to draw people in with visuals, use Instagram. This sounds really obvious, but the mistake people often make at the beginning is over-committing. Pick the most appropriate platform and start there, that way you won’t end up disappointing yourself. You can always expand later.”Kirsty Fife has published her work on blogs and also created physical fanzines. “I started out blogging, I ran a fat-fashion blog, Fatty Unbound,” she says. “Blogging did create a space that wasn’t there at the time.” Digitally, she honed her writing and found a community, but decided to begin putting out fanzines when her work became more personal.3. Start creating“Think about what you engage with, what stops your thumb in its endless scroll,” says Riches. “Then think about what’s missing. Write down – privately – what you want your content principles to be. What topics are you going to cover, what are your boundaries? What will you enjoy creating? It sounds limiting, but it’s very freeing it stops you trying to talk about everything at once.”Creating a fanzine, says Fife: “Is still very lo-fi. It’s a Sharpie, sketchbooks, pieces of paper. Although these days I scan everything into my computer and create PDFs to print and distribute. I don’t want any more incidents with things getting stuck in work photocopiers.”The DIY approach has also worked for Rafiq, whose new podcast This Thing Changed My Life launched this month. “Buy equipment and teach yourself,” she says. “Some editing software is free and it might seem scary, but it’s not. YouTube taught me everything, and I started recording in a day. It’s saved me so much time and money.”4. Believe in yourselfThe biggest barriers, however, often aren’t the practical ones. Why, you might think, would anyone want to hear from you?“It’s hard to put something out into the world,” says Fife. “I used to think that anything I made had to be perfectly finished and polished. It will never be perfect, so push through those feelings of anxiety. Put whatever you can out there, don’t wait for validation to start.”“There will always be someone for whom your work is meaningful.”5. Build your communityFife, Rafiq and Riches all agree they have found communities through their creative work. “I found both friends and collaborators,” says Fife.But it’s worth remembering that an audience won’t appear overnight. “It’s a marathon, not a sprint,” says Riches. “And you need to put the work in. Start where you feel comfortable, ask your close friends to like what you’re doing, then expand to other friends. Build.”Riches also points out that finding a community and finding an audience are very closely linked. “Don’t forget that social media is supposed to be social,” she says. “Support other people in your field. Collaborate. Share. Showcase others and make connections.”Before starting to produce her own, Fife bought zines created by others. She recommends looking at zine distros – places that sell and distribute a number of different fanzines. “I go to Pen Fight Distro, Synchronise Witches Press and Vampire Hag. There will be a voice you enjoy out there.”Rafiq proved there was an audience for her work that had been ignored or discounted by much of the culture industry. “Young people do love the arts,” she says. “Arts criticism isn’t just an endeavour for Oxbridge grads. You can be from the inner city, you can be BAME and want this.”The effort is worth it, Fife says. “I’ve had a lot of people reach out to me over the years because they listened to my voice. I don’t have a professional background in writing, art or design, but I made things that meant something to others.”Use Your Voice ...At the heart of the Your Voice.

Ms Martin is challenging Eamon Ryan for the leadership of the party.The Dublin Rathdown TD led the Green negotiating team and her support is seen as pivotal to securing the required two-thirds support of rank-and-file Green members in order for the party to enter government.In a statement released after the meeting, Ms Martin said: “There were never going to be, nor could there have been, outright winners in these negotiations and clearly we did not get everything we sought. I am however satisfied that the deal negotiated was the best achievable and that it includes some worthwhile and transformative policies.“If the Green Party enters government, our overriding concern will be with verifiable implementation of our policies. No member of the Green Party would wish to belong to a government that’s not enthusiastically and realistically delivering a green agenda. It is vital to ensure that our party’s independence and core values are never undermined or weakened by participation in government.”The Green TDs who abstained were Francis Noel Duffy, Patrick Costello and Neasa Hourigan.Internal ratificationFianna Fáil and the Greens will seek the assent of their members on a one member, one vote basis, while Fine Gael’s internal ratification process will be on the basis of an electoral college. It is estimated that about 15,000 Fianna Fáil members will be entitled to vote, and about 2,500 in the Greens. The Greens will hold a video conference to discuss the deal this Thursday.Fine Gael TDs, Senators and MEPs make up 50 per cent of the voting strength, followed by 25 per cent for constituency delegates, 15 per cent for councillors and 10 per cent for the executive council.Ballot papers will be issued in the coming days, with the results of each contest expected to be announced on Friday, June 26th.Sources said it is then likely, if the deal passes each party, that the Dáil will sit on Saturday, June 27th, to elect Micheál Martin taoiseach.The programme for government says that Mr Martin will serve as taoiseach until December 15th, 2022, when the Fine Gael leader will then take over the role.Speaking after his own party meeting last night, Mr Martin said the deal would now go to the party membership for a postal vote after a “very strong endorsement” from his party.He said there were strong contributions at a meeting of the parliamentary party in relation to housing, agriculture and farming. There was also support for the investment in cycling, railways and greenways.Mr Martin said he was receiving strong messages of support from members of the party in constituencies across the country.“One of the messages emanating from the parliamentary party meeting this evening was that the TDs and Senators want to go out there now and engage with the membership to persuade the members of the strength of this document, its relevance to where people are today in their lives, and the need to get it passed, and a government formed.”Mr Varadkar said a Fine Gael taoiseach would lead this government into the next election in 2025.

Photograph: Caroline QuinnDamien EagersLeon FarrellPA Wire Voters have little enthusiasm for the proposed new coalition - but Green voters say the party should enter government to take action on climate change, according to the results of the latest Ipsos MRBI opinion poll.The first such poll since the general election also shows how Fine Gael’s fortunes have been revived by the pandemic crisis, with the Government and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar enjoying record approval ratings and support for Fine Gael surging since the election.Given a choice between the proposed coalition, a different coalition or a general election, the Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil-Green government was the favoured option with the support of 36 per cent of voters. However, 27 per cent favoured a different (unspecified) combination while a third of voters (33 per cent) said they would prefer another general election.Among Green voters, however, support for the proposed three-party coalition was considerably higher, at 48 per cent.When voters were asked what the Green Party should do, 48 per cent said they should “make the best deal it can and form a government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil”, while a further 18 per cent said the party should form a coalition if its demands on climate action were met and 28 per cent of voters said the party should never form a government with the bigger parties.However, when Green voters were asked what the party should do, they were strongly in favour of entering government, with 31 per cent saying they should do the best deal they could, and a further 61 per cent saying they should enter government if their demands on climate action were met.Green leader Eamon Ryan needs a two thirds (67 per cent) majority among his members if the party is to join the coalition. The final draft of the programme for government was agreed by the three party leaders on Monday and will go to members for ratification.On party support, the numbers show strong growth in support for Fine Gael since the general election and a surge in Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s personal approval rating to 75 per cent. The satisfaction rating for the government is 72 per cent, though governments and leaders everywhere are seeing an increase in their ratings during the pandemic.In each case the comparison is with the final Ipsos MRBI poll of the general election campaign, though the results are not entirely comparable and today’s poll was conducted by telephone, owning to coronavirus restrictions. Previous polls have been conducted through face-to-face interviews.The poll was conducted among over 1,200 respondents between June 11th and 14th. The accuracy level is estimated to be approximately plus or minus 2.8 per cent."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4279769.1592242833!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish times poll varadkar to leave taoiseach s office at ratings peak","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach Leo Varadkar leaves Government Buildings at the end of coalition talks on Sunday.

This time, though, the situation will not spark willing and almost universal buy-in, which is perfectly normal.Varadkar continued, on that historic night: “This is the calm before the storm.” There was a similar, if less alarming, sense of foreboding about Monday’s historic deal between the leaders of former sworn enemies Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, with the Green Party also on board to stop the other two killing each other.The Taoiseach wasn’t contemplating oncoming storms. “This is an historic moment,” he said, and left it at that.At the same time a large group of Fianna Fáil councillors were mustering to reject the proposed contamination of their great party with “Fyne Gael” types, while fevered objections were expected from some members of the parliamentary party at a socially distanced meeting in Dublin’s convention centre.“With the size of the hall and the seats so far apart, they’ll be roaring at each other. It’ll be like the panto in there when the likes of Éamon Ó Cuív get going,” predicted one member, thoroughly looking forward to the spectacle.Meanwhile, the Greens are holding a postal ballot on whether to accept the deal, which seems to deliver on much of their manifesto demands, or stay out of government and the decision-making process. The leadership and negotiating team sounded cautiously optimistic that they would get the majority needed to carry on.As for Fine Gael, their parliamentary party has been holding regular weekly video meetings – unlike Fianna Fáil, which hasn’t met since the crisis began – so there was confidence the deal would be approved by TDs and Senators.But it’s a strange affair. The sides that might coalesce in two weeks’ time now talk about having to come to terms with living together, which isn’t always easy. The Taoiseach, about to shack up with a Fianna Fáil – a party from the other side of the tracks – said with a wistful smile: “We’re going to have to learn to work with each other. Trust each other.”And who knows, they may even grow to love each other in Micheál, Leo and Eamon Ryan’s Formation Nation.They are strange bedfellows. “We’ve two parties that are medium-sized and one party that’s not really a small party,” explained Varadkar.This will be the two meat and one veg government: FF, FG and the Greens.Not that Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin will be too troubled by this. If all goes to plan, he’ll soon have his feet under the taoiseach’s desk after decades of trying, and his mission will be to turn those abysmal figures around from the best platform in the land.After weeks of negotiations and the usual last-ditch dramatic all-nighters, their programme for government was ready by midday on Monday. It’s called Our Shared Future, which makes it sound like they’re talking about themselves again.First out of the traps was the Fianna Fáil leader, brimming with bonhomie and struggling to stop himself from smiling too much. He did his trademark brisk sideways scuttle through the gates and into Merrion Street, the document under his arm.It was bound in blue. What shade of blue? Well, maybe lighter than the shade of purplish blue some of his foot soldiers are turning.Some people thought the increased noise in the city on Monday morning was a sign of the gradual return to some semblance of normality after the coronavirus lockdown, but it was the sound of De Valera and countless more revered Soldiers of Destiny spinning in their graves.Micheál Martin had the good suit on, and it was hard not to spot the good shoes, mirror-shined at the toes. “Happy with the final document,” he said, setting the tone for what his two fellow partners in government would say later on. The next step was to discuss it with his parliamentary party.Looking forward to the new job? Is he going to be taoiseach?He went all bashful. “That will all be revealed later on in terms of … eh ...” he smiled.And he scuttled on. Happy out.Sad LeoMuch later in the day, Varadkar said the spoils – sorry, jobs – hadn’t been ided between the parties yet. You could see he was a little sad to be leaving the office.Was he happy enough to see his job going to the Fianna Fáil leader?Leo put on a brave face, something he isn’t good at.“Yeah,” he smiled, rocking back on his heels. “I am.” But then, “this isn’t about me”, it’s about forming a stable government. He took a sharp intake of breath. “Anybody leaving the taoiseach’s office is obviously going to feel a certain tinge of regret about that.”At least he can take his “Mr Taoiseach” Mister Men mug with him when he moves to his new ministerial office, and he can wrap it up carefully for when his turn comes again in 2½ years’ time. In the meantime, he can get a new “Mr Tánaiste” mug.But will he want to be taoiseach again? Maybe other dizzy heights will be beckoning by then. Maybe Simon Coveney could get the second-half gig instead.When he was asked about getting back into the top job as part of the deal, he replied: “You know, anybody who thinks they can predict what’s gonna happen in politics in a year’s time, in two years’, three years’ time is a very brave person ... Nobody knows for sure what the future holds, but I think we’ll be up to the challenge.”Green DealAnd so to Eamon Ryan, who had his ups and downs last week but has come out the other end with a deal some commentators have dubbed “The Green Deal” and describe as a very good outcome for his party from the negotiations.What was different from the last time, when the Greens negotiated themselves into government with Fianna Fáil? That didn’t go too well.“Experience – you know the way it works,” said Eamon, who managed to escape the midday media throng by leaving Government Buildings by a different exit. He went to Marks \u0026amp Spencer and bought his lunch and some socks.Were the negotiations so time-consuming he didn’t have time to find clean socks? “No, I have three sons. You wouldn’t believe the amount of socks we go through.” To him, walking away was never going to be an option.“This is the job we are all elected to do. It’s our duty. We had to come up with something. It’s what, as politicians, we do.”And then, if it doesn’t happen, there is always opposition. And that opposition was out very quickly on to the plinth on Monday afternoon. Mary Lou McDonald had five senior TDs arranged behind her like pieces on a chessboard.She promised the “most effective and coherent opposition in the history of the State”. She means business, too. The Dáil may yet be lifted from its slumber before the summer recess comes along.Back in Government Buildings, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste gave their briefing without the usual props. No flags, no fancy lectern and no slick branding for the document. No scripts either.A sign of things to come."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Kim Jong Un\u0026rsquos sister instructs army as North threatens to abandon agreement with South KoreaFierce criticism as editor of influential Rappler website faces up to six years in jailChile replaces health minister as deaths spiral while global cases exceed 7.6 millionSocial media giant says China ran network of accounts to spread misinformationTwo years after Trump-Kim summit minister says peace hopes are now \u0026lsquodark nightmare\u0026rsquoThere had been repeated calls by the Maori community to remove statue of John HamiltonLam warns city cannot afford further \u0026lsquochaos\u0026rsquoalmost 9,000 aged 11- 84 arrested in protests over past yearDecision marks a setback in relations amid efforts to persuade North to give up nuclear weapons programmeSouth Pacific nation of 5m declared it was coronavirus free on MondayHospitals feel the strain as lockdowns are eased despite fears of a spike in infectionsHolidaymaker said he stumbled into abandoned well after being chased by wild dogMan (60) dies some 500 miles north of Sydney after board-riders pull him to shoreLarge crowd gathers shortly after legislature outlaws insults to China\u0026rsquos national anthemTrump administration has presented China with \u0026lsquoopportunities\u0026rsquo on the world stageStorm made landfall further south than expected giving some respite to metropolis ravaged by coronavirusDeath at Wuhan\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquowhistleblower hospital\u0026rsquo prompts wave of anger at hospital authoritiesSchools in deprived areas reported girls using newspapers and rags in attempt to manage periodAnnual vigil to mark Tiananmen Square massacre cancelled but activists still plan to rallyOfficials and media say US criticism of Hong Kong policing illustrates double standardsExperts fear country\u0026rsquos caseload could reach 1m in several weeks if virus is not curbedStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4279823.1592246043!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu prepares to knuckle down for summer of brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s prime minister Boris Johnson participates in a video-conference call on Monday with European Council president Charles Michel, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, European Parliament president David Sassoli and the EU’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. Photograph: Andrew Parsons10 Downing StreetAFP via Getty ImagesThe European Union is preparing to redouble efforts and work through the summer to hammer out a deal with Britain following a meeting between prime minister Boris Johnson and EU leaders on Monday.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, European Council president Charles Michel and David Sassoli, president of the European Parliament, held a video conference with the British leader to take stock of the lack of progress in the talks, with just six months remaining before barriers to trade between Britain and its neighbours make an abrupt return, after decades spent removing them.The political leadership on both sides sent the message to their negotiators to go back over the areas where they had encountered stumbling blocks and try again to see if they can inch their way to a compromise that would avoid the most drastic ‘no trade deal’ option.“We agreed . . . that new momentum was required,” Ms von der Leyen said following the meeting.The mood in Brussels was upbeat towards the prospects of reaching a deal following the meeting, with those working close to the negotiations expecting a summer of late-night marathon talks that would likely run through the traditional holiday period.\u0026nbspBritain had initially briefed that it would abandon attempts to find a deal at this stage if it felt insufficient progress had been made, and focus its work instead on preparing for an automatic switch from January 1st to World Trade Organisation terms – a global default system of tariffs expected to cause a significant blow to trade.London’s shift away from this position and commitment to the talks has been taken as an indication that a deal can be found.Joint statementIn a joint statement following the meeting, both sides committed to “create the most conducive conditions for concluding and ratifying a deal before the end of 2020”.“The parties underlined their intention to work hard to deliver a relationship which would work in the interests of the citizens of the union and of the United Kingdom, ” the joint statement read. “They also confirmed their commitment to the full and timely implementation of the withdrawal agreement.”The two sides have agreed to six rounds of negotiations between June 29th and August 21st, held physically if possible and alternating between London and Brussels. Since February, negotiations have been over video conference because of the pandemic, ruling out informal side chats that often help find common ground.Sticking points include fishing rights and fair competition provisions for business.On policing and security co-operation, a way through could be possible, as the EU is open to workarounds through the international policing co-operation body Interpol. However, this would be a far more distant kind of co-operation than once hoped for.The British side has bridled at insistence by the EU that the deal should contain a commitment to uphold the Paris Climate Accord, insisting that this goes far beyond the stipulations of past trade deals. But in the EU’s view, modern-day trade deals have evolved to include such commitments, and they are appropriate because Britain is a like-minded country that has signed up to the agreement anyway.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus resistance among children primed 12 common colds","story":"Children may be protected from coronavirus because they catch so many colds, scientists have suggested.Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest children are just as likely to pick up the virus, but few ever develop serious disease, or even show symptoms.Now scientists have suggested that children may be resistant because their immune systems are already well primed by the common cold.The common cold is caused by four different types of coronavirus which circulate in the community and are largely harmless. But while adults pick up a cold around two to four times a year, school age children catch an average of 12 colds annually, studies have shown.Professor Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine, University of Oxford told the House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee, that it may allow youngsters to build up some ongoing resistance that adults do not have.“How you respond may be due to the state of your existing immunity to coronaviruses generally,” he told peers.“There is an interesting speculation at the moment, that suggests that many people in young or middle aged groups may have T-cells that can already see coronavirus.  It may well be able to provide some protection against this pathogen when it arrives.“A lot of kids get seasonal coronaviruses and it’s pretty common in our population and many will have quite a strong immunity to coronaviruses generally.“That is unproven, but there is evidence now for cross-reactivity at T-cell level at least, and that well might help dampen the effects of the virus when we get it.”Studies have shown that by the age of four, some 70 per cent of children already have antibodies against seasonal coronavirus, which could offer important protection.“It does raise questions about what herd immunity is in this population,” added Prof Bell. “It’s a very salient point and one that will send the modellers into a tailspin.”Professor Adrian Hayday, Chair, Department of Immunobiology, King\u0027s College London, Group Leader, Immunosurveillance Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute said the immune systems of young people may simply be better at reacting to new viruses.“All adults past a certain age - 30 to 35 - eventually have no thymus so their T-cells work by looking at whether they have seen something before, whereas children are very good at seeing things that are completely unknown. “The issue may be that children are able to see this as something fresh.”The scientists also said that older people may suffer from immune cell ‘senescence’ where their immune cells start to shut down but are not cleared away and replaced with a working version. Cell senescence is implicated in many diseases of ageing and may be behind the ageing process itself. But Prof Bell said for most people coronavirus was not a serious illness.“The people who get severe disease and die, the vast majority are elderly people and when young people get this disease they tend not to suffer very much. “That might be the state of people’s immune system at different ages. 70 per cent of the people who get this are completely asymptomatic, so at one end of the spectrum this is not a bad vial disease, at the other end it’s terrible.“The vast majority of people who get this disease don’t even know they’ve had it.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"disastrous lockdown can never repeated even virus returns","story":"Three months after we entered lockdown, as we tiptoe out to non-essential stores and meet a lonely relative, we can begin to benefit from something previously unavailable – experience. Instead of having to rely entirely on widely varying mathematical models and fight an unknown virus in a fog of uncertainty, governments can start to see what has actually worked in different places around the world.This new situation can have immediate benefits. For instance, we can now see that it is not necessary to have a two-metre separation between people to keep the virus in retreat where it is already at a low level. We know this from the experience of countries such as Denmark, France and Germany where the recommended distance is shorter, and we should not have to spend weeks agonising over it. Great swathes of our hospitality industry could thus be saved.We also know that these and other European countries are continuing to make progress without quarantining people entering from low-risk countries nearby, and can therefore concentrate on testing arrivals and stopping people coming from high-risk places. So the rather belated decision to require everyone arriving in the UK to quarantine themselves for two weeks ought soon to be ditched.We can also begin to discern the true cost of a national lockdown, not just in economic but in human terms. The unemployment figures about to be released represent a personal catastrophe for hundreds of thousands of people. Large rounds of corporate redundancies mean worse is to come. For many iniduals, lockdown is going to mean depression, family breakdown and despair.On top of this, we can now be sure that there will be tens of thousands of undetected cancers. Evidence is mounting that domestic abuse is rising, and mental health deteriorating. Dental standards will have dropped sharply, with lasting consequences. Above all, the education and development of millions of young people has been severely damaged, and they will carry the scars of that for the rest of their long lives.We now know therefore that a lockdown is not a temporary blip or a paid holiday, but a disaster for our society. It is increasing inequality, social tension, and unaffordable debt. Globally, the World Bank has estimated that up to 60 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty. Such a disaster cannot under any circumstances be repeated. There can be no second lockdown.To use yet another wartime analogy, a lockdown is like Dunkirk – a heroic operation in itself but the result of a massive failure. I am not singling out the Government for that, for this has been a failure at multiple levels: a failure by the whole world to prevent the trading of wild animals for consumption by China to report the initial outbreak openly by our and many other countries to prepare for this type of pandemic.Out of such failure, we have also learned crucial lessons. One of these is that some countries have escaped a good deal of the brutal costs of having to pursue a tight lockdown, even though they are large, complex and open nations. Germany and South Korea are examples that stand out.Furthermore, we can see that these countries have something in common – from the outset they were much more ambitious about testing. South Koreans used a fully-prepared track and trace system at once, and Germans were tested for the virus on a vastly greater scale than the people of Italy, Spain, Britain or America. This is why the Government, correctly, is rolling out a track and trace system here.Yet there is a danger of thinking that that is all we have to do. We should observe that even the South Koreans have sometimes struggled to keep a lid on the virus. And this week’s renewed outbreak in Beijing shows it can easily return just when you think you’ve got rid of it. If it is true that a lockdown represents a massive failure of policy and the costs of it cannot be repeated, and also true that testing has always provided the key to avoiding such failure, then it is time for the British Government to be much more ambitious in its goals.In particular, ministers should listen carefully to Tony Blair. That is not an easy sentence for me to write, given that I spent four years of my life as his official arch-enemy. But the report published earlier this month by his Institute for Global Change argues persuasively for the Government to prepare now for testing on a truly massive scale – involving millions of tests every week as people enter the country, arrive at work, attend conferences or just decide to go out.His argument is that a wide range of rapid tests are now under development and that they can be rolled out faster with Government funding, commitment and accelerated permissions. Many are being developed by British firms. While the cost would run into billions of pounds, it would be very little compared to the costs of one day of lockdown and could even be financed through special bonds.These almost instant point-of-use tests would provide warning of any outbreak and could be used to produce the data necessary to act quickly and avoid further lockdowns. They would be used in conjunction with lab-based tests to pinpoint new cases. This is not an alternative to a track and trace system, but could make that far more likely to be successful.Such a programme would require the harnessing of the resources of many small labs, expanding large ones, and making financial commitments to firms who could manufacture the simpler, mass tests. Taking them would become part of our way of life. But that is better than mass unemployment and widespread other illnesses becoming our way of life instead. Currently, the Government appears to be encouraging employers to adopt such testing but has not made the leap to saying this is an overriding national strategy.It ought to do so, with a Cabinet minister responsible for seeing it through. We have seen enough to know that a lockdown is so destructive that it can only ever be allowed once. That is why we should get out of it as soon as that can safely be done. But it is also why we should prepare, invest and organise to avoid it ever being contemplated again.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sir arthur bomber harris statue latest target activists","story":"Sir Arthur Bomber Harris has become the latest target of activists demanding statues are toppled, over his wartime aerial bombardment English Heritage is liaising with the politan Police about the safety of the statue after anti-racism protestors targeted other public monuments in recent demonstrations.The Second World War officer, who pursued the Allied bombing of Nazi Germany, has a memorial outside the dedicated RAF church of St Clement Danes in London, which campaigners want to be reviewed and removed.A senior RAF source told the : There is no situation where vandalising a monument of someone who fought for and delivered our freedom, could ever be justified.Scores of statues across the country honouring figures with links to the slave trade and colonialism have been earmarked for removal by campaigners in the wake George Floyd’s death in the US.The British RAF commander, who helped devise the bombing of Dresden, has now been listed alongside slave traders by activists seeking to “Topple the Racists”, with pacifist groups calling for an end to his glorification. Monuments to Edward Colston and Robert Milligan have already been purged from public spaces, and campaigners are calling for Harris’s likeness to be removed for being a “colonial warmonger”.Erection of the statue in 1992 was originally opposed by the Peace Pledge Union (PPU), and current members have welcomed the reassessment of Harris’ controversial legacy.The commander is often blamed for the fire-bombing of Dresden which killed around 25,000 people, which some have branded a war crime, and a general area bombing which earned him the nickname “butcher”.“I don’t think that Bomber Harris should be celebrated,” said Symon Hill of the PPU.“I think with the current debate around statues in the UK, it’s an opportunity for us as a society to think about our history, to think about what we want to celebrate.“If there is a reassessment of the Bomber Harris statue, we would certainly welcome that.”He added: “This is not about erasing history, we’ve spoken more as a society about British history since these protests than we ever did before.  It’s about learning from history, and choosing what we want to celebrate.”A listing on the Topple the Racists website reads: Sir Arthur Travers Harris, 1. Baronet GCB OBE AFC, was a colonial warmonger in Rhodesia and responsible for the area bombardment of civilian villages in Mesopotamia in the early 1920s.English Heritage owns the statue outside St Clement Danes Church, and is discussing probation measures after monuments in London and across the country were damaged in recent protests.A spokesman for the charity said: “We take very seriously any threat to the London statues in our care.

Only one mentioned coming within six feet of a patient, and that paper showed proximity had no impact. “Queuing outside shops, dodging each other once inside, and not getting too close to other people anywhere: social-distancing has become the norm,” they write. “The two-metre rule, however, is also seriously impacting schools, pubs, restaurants and our ability to go about our daily lives. “Much of the evidence in this current outbreak informing policy is poor quality. Encouragement and handwashing are what we need, not formalised rules.”A University of Dundee study also suggests that 78 per cent of the risk of infection happens below one metre and there is just an 11 per cent chance of any increased distance making a difference.Dr Mike Lonergan, senior statistician and epidemiologist  who reviewed 25 papers compiled for the World Health Organisation (WHO) said “Our conclusion is that avoiding contact is very important and that a one metre distance might be slightly better than just avoiding contact, but the difference is unlikely to be much. These data give no indication that two metres is better than one metre.”On Monday the Isle of Man became the first area of Britain to relax the two metre rule saying businesses will no longer be required to implement social distancing and employees can return to work as usual. Howard Quayle, Chief Minister of the Isle of Man said: “I’m sorry that we had to come between you and a hug, and I am glad that today we can give people their hugs back.”The government has promised to review social distancing before pubs and restaurants reopen in July amid concerns that many businesses will be profitable if it remains in place.Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, said onlookers should not be fooled by the long queues, and warned one in 10 independent businesses may not ever reopen.“Despite what you will see this week, which will be buoyant, the tough times are still coming,” he added.Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UKHospitality, said the review was a ‘matter of survival’  for many firms and a million jobs could be lost if the two-metre rule stays.“If businesses are opening at two-metre social distance, then they\u0027re operating at 30 per cent of their normal revenues, and for a quarter of our small hospitality businesses they won\u0027t be able to open at all.Jace Tyrrell, chief executive at New West End Company, said the two-metre rule is ‘sub-economic’.He said the West End, which normally turns over £10 billion a year, is expecting losses to exceed £5 billion this year, and warned that up to 50,000 jobs could be at risk.“We absolutely have to review this,” he said.In a letter to Boris Johnson signed by restaurant leaders including Will Shu, the founder of Deliveroo, Julian Metcalfe, the founder of Itsu and Emma Woods, the ceo of Wagamama, the prime minister was told: “Unless your Government takes urgent action, shuttered restaurants in towns and cities across the country will be a permanent reminder of the damage this pandemic has done.”Health minister Ed Argar on Monday said the two metre rule may be relaxed if customers agree to wear face coverings. He said the change was one of a ‘menu of options’ that was being considered. “Distance, face coverings, a whole range of other measures - ... all of those will be considered in the context of this review,” he said.At the daily briefing, Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, said that the scientific base was ‘constantly evolving’ and that changing the rule was ‘something that can be looked at.’“We want to get those bars and restaurants and small businesses up and running as soon as possible but it must be done in a safe and responsible way,” he said.But former Cabinet minister John Redwood warned that businesses need reassurances now.“If we want our hospitality industry to survive in any form they need to know today so they can prepare their routes and tables and the rest of it - leaving it until July 4 means many more lost jobs, he said.Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former leader of the Conservative party, said recent research showed that reduction from two metres to one metre would raise infection risk just slightly from 1.3 per cent to 2.6 per cent.“You cannot run a business on two metres, he told the .“The science is not exact on this and we have to balance risk, just like we do every day. You get on a bicycle in busy traffic, you don’t use a zebra crossing to cross a road, you ski, you get on a motorcycle, these are risks but we balance them by what we consider important enough to mitigate the risk.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"trust bbc among politically committed left right study shows","story":"Trust in the BBC has plummeted among those on the Left and the Right, a new study has shown.Brexit put the BBC “in the firing line” and damaged its reputation with those on both sides of the political ide, according to a report by The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.The global survey of 80,000 people in 40 countries asked UK respondents to rate the “trustworthiness” of the BBC.Among those who described themselves as “very left wing” or “very right wing”, the proportion who said they trusted BBC News has fallen by 20 percentage points in the past two years. The figure fell from 67 per cent in 2018 and 63 per cent in 2019 to just 47 per cent now.The report stated: “The BBC has a duty to be duly impartial in its news coverage but our data shows that, although overall trust in its news remains high, criticism from those who are politically committed (on the left and the right) has grown over the last few years.The Digital News Report 2020 also found that people who use television as a main source of news prefer that news to be “neutral or objective”. In the US, the number of viewers saying they prefer news that “shares their point of view” has risen by six percentage points since 2013.However, since the Covid-19 crisis was first reported, nightly viewership of BBC television news bulletins has risen - up by around 30 per cent in March.The report suggested that a “ided” society may account for public trust in all news coverage plunging by 22 percentage points since the run up to the EU referendum. It also noted that trust in the media amongst respondents who self-identify as Left-wing collapsed from 38 per cent in January 2019 to 15 per cent a year later. The report said: “Many on the left blamed the Labour defeat on unfair media treatment of its leader Jeremy Corbyn by a \u0027biased press\u0027.” The report also found that just 25 per cent of those who read local newspapers in the UK say they would miss them, compared with 54 per cent in Germany and 49 per cent in Norway.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/29/17/apple.jpg","title":"apple app store iphone research revenue profits study analysis group","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Half a trillion dollars \u0027facilitated\u0027 by the App Store, new report findsApple says that most of the money being facilitated by its App Store does not go through the company, as it unveiled new research into the scale of the digital economy.The App Store helped facilitate some $519 billion in billings and sales last year, new analysis showed.Most of that money did not go through App Store purchases or in-app payments, it said, but rather simply relied on software for Apple\u0027s platforms to make goods and services available.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn its announcements about the App Store in the past, Apple has focused primarily on the amount of money it has paid to developers directly, through sales of apps and in-app purchases on its platforms. But the new report attempts to highlight the broader impact on the economy that its digital store has, by giving an account of how many sales are facilitated through those apps more broadly.The new announcement comes amid questions over the scale of app stores run by Apple, Google and other companies. Last week, Axios reported that US antitrust investigators asked Apple whether chief executive Tim Cook would give testimony as part of a probe into competition among tech companies.Apple and Mr Cook have repeatedly said that they welcome the scrutiny of the App Store that has come with increased questions over whether it offers a fair playing field to the apps and companies that rely on it to reach customers.Apple Stores to re-open across UK after coronavirus shutdownSome companies have argued that they are unfairly treated on the App Store, where any payments made are subject to a 30 per cent cut from Apple. That has led some of the biggest firms to opt out of offering in-app purchases entirely, with Netflix and Amazon\u0027s apps directing their customers to their websites if they want to subscribe or purchase, for instance.Apple\u0027s new research showed that such purchases – those made outside of the App Store system, but which were facilitated by apps downloaded from within it – made up the vast majority of the sales that are facilitated by the App Store.More than 85 per cent of the $519 billion total facilitated by the App Store goes entirely to third-party developers and businesses, it said.It pointed to examples such as companies that sell physical goods and services,which together represent the largest share of the total at $413 billion.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Other kinds of commerce apps made up the rest of those physical goods and services, such as transport apps, ride-hailing apps such as Uber and Lyft, and food delivery apps like Just Eat.Away from those physical apps, other digital services such as music and video streaming services which in total represented $61 billion. It is in that area that many companies have opted out of payments through the App Store entirely, with major Apple competitors such as Spotify and Netflix instead choosing to make their customers sign up outside of their apps and then use that log-in on their Apple devices.Those companies have argued that Apple\u0027s own services – which include TV and music streaming services that are direct competitors – are able to gain an unfair advantage because they can be favoured by Apple and do not have to lose any cut taken in purchases through the App Store.Apple also offers the only way of getting new apps onto its iPhones and other hardware, since there is no way to download or install software from other platforms. Apps that sell other apps are banned.Away from physical goods and services and digital subscriptions, advertising made up most of the rest of the total, with marketing being shown on games as well as free apps such as Twitter and Pinterest, alongside those that show apps but also offer subscriptions, like the MLB\u0027s app.China represented almost half of that $519 billion figure, Apple said, with $246 billion of the total. That is in part because of the country\u0027s more developed mobile commerce ecosystem, Apple said, with a variety of services available through a host of apps that operate outside of Apple\u0027s payment systems.The US made up $138 billion, Europe represented $51 billion, Japan accounted for $37 billion and the remaining $47 billion came from the rest of the world.The study was commissioned by Apple but carried out by independent economic consulting firm the Analysis Group.The report only looked at data from 2019, meaning that it did not reflect the changes that have come about as the result of the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting lockdowns.Since then, the company has seen a rise in apps like social, education and business chat tools, as well as food and grocery apps. At the same time, apps that have faced restrictions or require in-person interactions have dropped off, Apple said.Apple\u0027s announcement came just days before its Worldwide Developers Conference, which it uses to highlight the work of those who make apps for its platforms.

MPs recommend that the government should give this group 80 per cent of their average monthly income, up to a total of £2,500 per month.Providing support for directors of limited companies is trickier, the Treasury has consistently said. People in some industries who are in effect sole traders decide instead to set up as a limited company for a number of reasons, one of which is that the tax rate on idends is lower than on income.The Treasury argues that its support schemes are designed to replace income, not idends which come out of company profits. But groups supporting the self-employed and small businesses counter that this is unfair on people who have chosen to set up in this way.Workers must not be abandoned as furlough winds down, warns union boss“There are over 710,000 freelancers who work through limited companies, most of whom are now burning through their savings to get by,” said Andy Chamberlain, policy director of the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed.“This group in particular is a startling and glaring omission from the government support. There are also hundreds of thousands of people who became self-employed just last year, who, in the early stages of their freelance career, are likely to be in a particularly precarious financial position.

ForgottenPAYE is calling for grants of £14,000 for new starters and the newly self-employed to cover living costs between March and September.“Hardworking taxpayers have already gone homeless, been pushed into debt and poverty, and been forced to turn to food banks in a bid to survive,” said a spokesperson for the campaign group.“The mental health impact on those who have had their pleas for help ignored for over 13 weeks has resulted in a drastic increase in depression and anxiety, with many verging on suicide.“This is a huge step in the fight for justice for the 1.7 millions freelancers and 3 million-plus taxpayers who have been left with zero income and zero financial support from the government for over 13 weeks during an economic crisis.”   A Treasury spokesperson said: “The swift and targeted action we’ve taken has protected millions of jobs and livelihoods and our interventions have been rightly welcomed by the select committee.“Our wide-ranging support package is one of the most comprehensive in the world – with generous income support schemes, billions paid in loans and grants, tax deferrals and more than £6.5bn injected into the welfare safety net.“All our support is targeted to make sure we use public funds responsibly, helping those who need it most as quickly as possible, while minimising fraud risk.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

John Lewis reopening two branches in Poole and Kingston-upon-Thames, while Argos opened 145 out of more than 800 stores.Primark took a different approach, reopening all of its 153 stores, and enjoying crowds at several of them, including its flagship Oxford Street store in London. The budget clothing specialist has been hit harder than most by the lockdown as it does not have an online storefront, meaning goods have been left stacked up in warehouses or on shelves. One shopper at Birmingham’s Primark store said it had been “a delight” to return to the city centre shop, which like other stores saw large queues that morning.She told the PA news agency: “It took a long time but I bought a lot of dresses, nightwear and bras. I have missed it a lot and I’m really happy.”Other shoppers were less pleased with the extended queues. Kristina Taylor, 40, who works in finance, told PA: “I just need to have my screen protector replaced, that’s all. It’s just something that has been niggling me since day one.”Asked if she was pleased about shops reopening, she said: “Yes and no.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“I will pop by Primark to see the queue. But not keen on all of this queueing, it makes me think twice about whether I need something from that shop.”Certain shops face particular challenges in complying with government guidance, such as shoe retailers which now have to “quarantine” pairs that customers have tried on. Changing rooms at most clothes shops remained closed while bookshops took items off shelves after people have touched them. Waterstones will only return items to the shop floor after 72 hours.Shops are required to install screens at checkouts and mark two-metre distance intervals on the floor to help customers stay apart. Retailers including Ikea and John Lewis have introduced social distancing wardens to help with this.As with supermarkets, numbers within non-essential stores will be strictly limited, meaning shoppers will be faced with queues outside.Councils urged shoppers to take extra care when visiting high streets and town centres to avoid a second spike in coronavirus infections.To make visits to town centres and high streets safe, councils are carrying out more frequent street cleaning, providing hand-sanitiser posts, adapting public seating and conveniences, creating more pedestrianised spaces on streets and deploying council staff or volunteers to provide help and advice.Government ministers have also tried their best to give people the confidence to return to high streets and shopping centres. Paul Scully, minister for small businesses, told BBC Breakfast: “The high street is going to be a different place to what it was before, with the one-way systems, with the hand sanitisers, and with people not trying clothes on in the same way.” He echoed Boris Johnson who said on Sunday that people “should shop and shop with confidence”.Shops have been asked to encourage customers to shop alone unless they need extra assistance and to adjust routes around stores to minimise congestion.Given the constraints in place, retailers face a tough challenge encouraging some reluctant consumers back into stores.While there is likely to be some pent-up demand as people have the chance to browse and shop in a way they have not been able to since March, millions of consumers remain wary of public spaces while others are concerned about their finances.What are the lockdown rules now and what can you do from today?Indications from other countries is that footfall on high streets will, unsurprisingly, increase as shops reopen but that this may not translate into sales.That puts Britain’s struggling high streets in an even more perilous position as shops face high costs on rents and wages, for example, but greatly reduced revenues.David Fox, co-head of retail at property advisers Colliers, said: “Due to the social distancing measures and strict government protocols that retailers need to adhere to, there will be a mismatch of customers desire to shop and businesses ability to meet the demand. “The difficulty for retailers will be the logistics of the new health, safety and hygiene policies within the stores, with skeleton staffing to manage queueing and perform their sales duties.”Those shoppers who do venture out may be able to pick up bargains, particularly if they can hold off on purchases for a couple of weeks.Primark revealed recently that it had £1.9bn-worth of items in stock, more than double the amount it would usually hold. By one estimate, fashion retailers have around £15bn of unsold garments. Shoppers may be able to take advantage of heavy discounts as chains try to sell this excess before it falls out of fashion.However, some experts think retailers will hold off before slashing prices. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at consultancy firm PwC said it was unlikely that consumers would see “wall-to-wall sales” this week.Many retailers have already offered big discounts online, with promotions reaching levels normally only seen on Black Friday.Ms Hooker predicts a bounce in sales this month. “If June trading does not make a big enough dent in stocks, we predict a rush of promotions and sales later in the summer.”Oxfam said charity shops are likely to be packed with “gems” as they reopen this week and fill up with items that people have cleared out during lockdown.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This could be due to the delay between people experiencing symptoms and people being tested for Covid-19.Google has previously attempted to predict such trends through its nowcast function, which launched in 2008. A paper published in the scientific journal Nature at the time explained how people\u0027s search patterns could estimate flu prevalence two weeks before it was registered by official bodies like the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).As the world\u0027s most popular online search engine, the data from people\u0027s digital footprints offered potentially life-saving insights and it was the poster child of so-called \u0027Big Data\u0027. But by 2015 it was shut down after it failed to foresee a massive flu outbreak in 2013.UK now has more daily Covid-19 deaths than the rest of Europe combinedIt was described by some publications as an epic failure and a note on its landing page now states: Google Flu Trends and Google Dengue Trends are no longer publishing current estimates of Flu and Dengue fever based on search patterns...  It is still early days for nowcasting and similar tools for understanding the spread of diseases like flu and dengue – we\u0027re excited to see what comes next.A blog post explaining the decision said that Google would work directly with academic institutions to make sense of the search data. More than 265 peer-reviewed papers have since drawn on aggregated data taken from Google searches, used to track epidemics like Ebola in 2014, Zika in 2016 and West Nile fever over several years in Italy.

Better home schoolwork provision, and better still an early safe return to school for as many as possible, should now become a top priority for government.”Additional reporting by Press AssociationUCL Institute of Education\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.A Covid-19 vaccine that is being developed by scientists at Imperial College London could be made available to the British population for as little as £3 per person.The university is working on one of two bids in the UK to develop a form of immunisation against coronavirus, along with Oxford University’s Jenner Institute.Robin Shattock, a professor of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College, and his team of researchers are making use of RNA technology that would allow the vaccine to be manufactured on a mass but affordable scale.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Imperial College vaccine, which takes a “small portion” of genetic material from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, delivers instructions to the body’s muscle cells to make the “spike” protein seen on the surface of coronavirus.In theory, the presence of this protein will provoke an immune response and the production of antibodies, thereby offering protection against Covid-19. How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThere is no need to grow the live virus when manufacturing an RNA vaccine, making it safer to manufacture. And importantly, only small quantities of the pathogen – a thousandth of a thousandth of a gram of its genetic coding, or RNA – are used for gene sequencing and vaccine testing.A litre’s worth would therefore provide enough material for 200 million people, according to Professor Shattock. “It really is a tiny dose,” he told The Times. “That’s very good from a safety point of view but also in terms of production — it makes it much easier to scale up.He estimates that enough vaccine could be made for the UK for around £200 million. “That’s roughly £3 for each person to be immune, assuming it works. That’s really good value.”Researchers believe that two shots will be needed to provide immunity against Covid-19.Whereas Oxford University has licensed its vaccine to pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to help scale-up manufacturing, the Imperial College team will produce their vaccine as part of the joint social enterprise VacEquity Global Health (VGH), in partnership with Morningside Ventures investment firm.Imperial and VGH will waive royalties for the UK and low-income countries “and charge only modest cost-plus prices to sustain the enterprise’s work, accelerate global distribution and support new research”, the university said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailProfessor Shattock’s team is continuing to rely on public funding for its research. Last month, it received £18.5m from the government for trials and manufacturing, and a further £5m has come from philanthropic sources.“We’ve already kind of put everything in place to be able to use for the UK and we hope that the government will act on wanting to purchase that, and we’re working with other partners around the world do that,” Professor Shattock told The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.“We have a very different model to AstraZeneca. If you like we want to be almost the Microsoft of the vaccine world where we make the genetic code, we pass that to other manufacturers and give them a sub licence so that they can then use their hardware to manufacture the vaccine in different parts of the globe.”While the Oxford vaccine has already entered into the latter stages of the clinical pathway, researchers at Imperial started their own human trials on Monday.A further trial involving 6,000 people is planned for October and if these prove successful, Imperial hopes the vaccine could be distributed in the UK and abroad early next year.Professor Shattock said his team’s vaccine would not be available by Christmas but “in the first two quarters of next year if things go extraordinarily well”.“At the moment there is a lot of speculation and we really need to deal with facts and data rather than over-promising and under-delivering,” he told the Royal Society of Medicine last week.Professor Shattock said that his team had been collaborating with scientists at Oxford University in sharing data and results.“We are not trying to beat each other. We are trying to work together and make a vaccine available in the fastest possible time.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Comedian John Cleese has mocked Fox News for quoting a Reddit joke that referenced Monty Python and The Holy Grail live on air as part of a report on Seattle’s Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ).Cleese’s comment followed a weekend of mockery of the network by social media users after Martha MacCallum, host of Fox News’ The Story, attempted to illustrate claims that there was leadership problems within the community by reading aloud a screenshot of a Reddit post.The reporter failed to realise that the user was quoting a scene from Cleese\u0027s famous 1975 comedy Monty Python and The Holy Grail, and the moment quickly went viral online.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn the scene referenced in the post, King Arthur approaches two peasants who are mud-farming out on the land and announces himself as their king. A satirical conflict over the leadership structure ensues.Fawlty Towers episode to be reinstated with warning over racial slursLet\u0027s not get distracted by Fawlty Towers. There\u0027s real work to doJohn Cleese slams ‘stupid’ decision to remove Fawlty Towers episodeInside the occupied vegan paradise – and Trump’s ‘ugly anarchist’ hell“I thought we had an autonomous collective,” Ms MacCallum said. “An anarcho-syndicalist commune at the least, we should take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.”“We take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week, but all the decisions of that officer have to be ratified at a special bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs, but by a two-thirds majority in the case of purely external affairs,” on of the peasants, Dennis, actually says in the film which was quoted nearly verbatim in the Reddit post.The Reddit post later included the quote where Dennis says the king can’t “simply expect to wield supreme executive power just because someone threw a sword at him”.This portion of the post was not read aloud by the host to viewers but it was shown in the screenshot aired.It is not the first time that the network, which is America’s most-watched cable news channel, has been criticised for spreading false information about the police-free settlement, which was formed in support of Black Lives Matter in protest of the killing of black American\u0027s by police.The broadcaster had to remove doctored pictures from its website on Friday that pushed misleading information about the settlement after The Seattle Times reported that the photos were inaccurate.There have been conflicting reports of the nature of the commune, with President Donald Trump and Fox News calling the people involved with CHAZ anarchists, while other reports show that the area has remained a peaceful and supportive community.Fox News declined to comment about the Monty Python error when contacted by The Independent on Sunday.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.The European Union began reopening its internal borders on Monday as member countries like Greece and Belgium prepared to welcome tourists after months of coronavirus lockdowns.While the travel restrictions put in place in response to the Covid-19 pandemic began to officially expire on 15 June, Schengen area member and associated countries are removing border controls in a patchwork manner. Italy reopened its borders for travellers from within Europe on 3 June. Spain has already allowed tourists in from some countries including Germany and will reopen to most European countries on 21 June.Germany was to end land border checks on 15 June, while the Dutch announced they would ease warnings against non-essential foreign travel. The Czech Republic is allowing travel from within Europe but placing restrictions on countries with high levels of infections.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastAustria, which has already opened most of its borders, will lift restrictions with 31 countries excluding Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.Poland reopened its borders to EU members and the UK from 13 June, while Sweden never closed.Non-essential travel into the European Union remains restricted until 30 June, although countries like Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Slovakia and Slovenia have begun lifting restrictions for foreigners from nations they deem safe.President of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said she was happy borders were reopening across Europe.The European Commission launched the “Re-Open EU“ website giving travel information, coronavirus rules, and advice on whether places like hotels or beaches were open.Greece’s tourist season began with the reopening of some hotels and international flights from Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, China, Israel and Lebanon to Athens and Thessaloniki airports.Some of the worst-affected countries, like the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain are not currently on Greece’s approved list for travel. Travellers from countries that do meet Greece’s “epidemiological criteria” are tested on arrival and quarantined in a designated hotel for 7 days if the test is negative, and 14 days if it is positive.In Belgium, shops and museums were allowed to reopen from 18 May while cafes, restaurants and attractions began opening on 8 June. Restrictions for hospitality and culture industries would remain in place to 1 July while major events will stay shut down until after August.France, meanwhile, has said it wants reciprocity and could place restrictions on countries placing restrictions on French travellers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo? You’ll find plenty of of delicious ideas from the likes of Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Amanda Grant at vegpower.org.uk. You can get involved too: share your recipes using #SeasonalVeg on social mediaTry different types of fishSimilarly, the UK\u0027s fishing industry has suffered during the current coronavirus pandemic.While higher-end produce is currently not being purchased by restaurants, much of the catch from UK waters that would usually be exported hasn’t been, so boats across the country have struggled to sell their fish and seafood. That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

All the famous faces, including a picture of Sir Peter, are “fans” of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.Each fragment will be signed by the artist and auctioned on Bidsquare, with bids starting at £325. The auction will be live until midnight on 26 June.The idea originated when London Advertising approached Sir Peter about the project as it wanted to use the mural to raise money for organisations helping people during the pandemic.Sir Peter, who also designed artwork for Paul Weller, Ian Dury and The Who, said: “I’m very happy that the Mandarin Oriental mural can be used a second time to raise money for such a wonderful purpose.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing. Everyone is very grateful.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Tens of thousands of people have poured onto England’s high streets as non-essential shops were allowed to reopen for the first time since lockdown began. While many of those who stepped out despite coronavirus fears to engage in some long-awaited retail therapy cited concerns about looming job losses in the sector and a need to restart the economy, the overwhelming sense was of people urgently seeking to regain a sense of normality after 11 weeks in stasis.Despite the busy street scenes captured across the country, with reports of overnight queues which sometimes remained throughout the day, the unseen majority will have remained at home, with some newly returned employees questioning why customers were physically shopping rather than purchasing online. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA leap towards the ”new normal” pledged by ministers was perhaps the prevailing theme of the day, evident in the extensive range of new measures taken by stores to keep employees and customers as safe as possible.Shoppers, already familiar with socially distanced queues, were offered hand sanitiser upon entry, found fitting rooms closed and, in some cases, lip service was paid to ”quarantines” for items touched by customers.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?However, the complexity in policing some new measures was clear at a glance, with many shoppers visibly struggling not to pick up items as they browsed and staff naturally unable to take stock of all such occasions when items were placed back on the rack, rather than in quarantine.In one instance, the excitement in the crowd awaiting entry to Nike Town at Oxford Circus bubbled over into tension, with bodies packed up against the door.There were reports of some punches being thrown in the melee, as staff sought to calm the crowd. As police surveyed the packed queue, one officer branded the situation “ridiculous”, adding that they foresaw more such events throughout the day.Despite the health risks, many people who turned out to Britain’s busiest high street – where The Independent visited to witness retail’s return – appeared keen to resume some sense of normality, with many appearing somewhat fatigued by lockdown measures.Queueing outside a Zara on Oxford Street at 9.30am, Patricia, a 54-year-old from Sutton, southwest London, explained that she had been enticed by the sales, and had travelled to the largest branch because a lot of items were sold out online.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailShe said she was “confident” that stores were taking the appropriate measures to return safely, but cited concerns about public transport.“I am probably quite reassured that it’s going to be done in the right way. It’s a big store, they have to adhere to the rules,” she said, adding: “I’ve got heart problems so I was worried about the congestion on the train. It’s not so bad on trains, but on the undergrounds there’s no social distancing, everyone’s together.”On Sunday, the prime minister urged the nation to “shop, and shop with confidence”, saying he was “very optimistic” about the looming return to the high street, although he admitted that there could be either a “huge wave” or a “trickle” of customers.While, by lunchtime, the growing Oxford Street crowds – pocked with a wealth of new signs reminding people to socially distance – appeared to suggest something of a wave, one shopper flatly refused to credit Mr Johnson.Enticed by a 50 per cent discount for NHS staff at Sports Direct, where she stood in a long queue, Paula said it was the first time since January she had ventured into central London because of coronavirus fears. “Because I’m an NHS worker, you know it’s coming, you know it’s there – so I avoided it like the plague, and now I feel it’s probably slightly safer. Obviously social distancing will be difficult ... but there is hand sanitiser everywhere, people are trying.Paula said that her workplace had been hard-hit by coronavirus, saying: “We’ve had masses, so Covid doesn’t bother me because I’ve had so much contact with it. If I drop dead, I drop dead.’”Asked whether concern for the economy had influenced her trip, she replied: “God yeah, people are losing their jobs left, right and centre and that’s the frightening thing is that come Christmas, there’ll be so many people unemployed. Nobody will be shopping and the economy will be really flat, and then you’ve got a no-deal Brexit potentially on the horizon. It’s just going to be a nightmare.”With data from Springboard showing that footfall in English high streets was up by 51.7 per cent on Monday from the previous week – although down by roughly a third from the year before – some suggested they would forego larger, more crowded stores for independent businesses.“I won’t be shopping in any major outlets as frankly I think it’ll be too busy and queues will be extremely long. Whereas boutique stores may have a much more personal and relaxed atmosphere,” said Alex Noble, a 26-year-old living in Fulham who runs a fashion blog.“I am happy for independent retailers, who perhaps hadn’t focused on their websites and social media before lockdown, and thus have really felt the brunt of no custom.“They can open their doors and get back to what they do best. What’s more, they’re probably not able to offer huge sales and discounts online, and so have likely suffered from larger brands being able to do this – I must admit I’ve capitalised on these online sales.”While undoubtedly significant numbers of the thousands returning to work would have been reluctant to do so, the employees at international retail brands spoken to by The Independent said they were happy to be back and satisfied that their employers had taken significant steps to ensure their safety.Ross, a skateboarding instructor at The Bowl in Selfridge’s – which was filled with excited crowds of all ages – said that he felt the return could have come quicker.“There’s a lot of safety measures and one-way systems and social distancing, so it’s a bit different but it’s nice to be back, nice to have a bit of normality back to real life,” he said. “For a lot of people, it could have come quicker, I think. Some people I’ve spoken to really enjoyed the time off and could have done with another month in the good weather, but the majority are glad to be back I think.Experts unable to give full information on local clusters until AugustDespite many stores having recalled some members back to work weeks ago, or even keeping some in-store throughout lockdown to prepare for the new methods of operating, some suggested the return had been too soon.“Eventually it had to happen, but I believe the UK government should have waited until July. I know the rates have gone down, but just to have more stable ground,” said one assistant manager at the store of a global brand in Camden.She added: “The shop floor isn’t ready. But as a shop, for me and for my staff and having the right training and the principles we’re going to follow, absolutely we’re ready.However, she added that there could be a feeling of resentment among some staff that customers are visiting the store rather than safely shopping online.“I don’t see the point in going into a store when I can buy it online. And I think during lockdown more people have realised that,” she said.“For me, I don’t see why people are coming out shopping now. Nobody needs a pair of trainers this much. I think it’s going to be the case of people leaving their home because now they can, so it’s going to be an excuse.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.A photograph of an iceberg that “most likely” sank the Titanic has emerged more than 100 years after the disaster took place.It was taken by the captain of another passenger ship crossing the Atlantic, less than two days before the Titanic went down.The black and white picture was taken by seaman W Wood – a keen photographer – while he was serving as captain on board the SS Etonian on 12 April, 1912.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCapt Wood made a note of his geographic coordinates when he saw the iceberg – they were almost the same for when the Titanic struck an iceberg 40 hours later and sank.Capt Wood got the photo developed when he completed his journey and arrived in New York. He printed a copy of the photo and sent it to his grandfather along with a letter.Belfast shipyard that built the Titanic falls into administrationThe photo is dated 1913 but auctioneers say Capt Wood’s letter corroborates the image.He wrote in the letter: “I am sending you a sea picture, the Etonian running before a gale and the iceberg that sank the Titanic.“We crossed the ice tracks 40hrs before her and in daylight so saw the ice easily and I got a picture.”He wrote a caption in black ink on the photo, noting “iceberg taken by Captain Wood SS Etonian in 41°50N 49°50W April 12th at 4pm”.The Titanic struck an iceberg at 10.20pm on 14 April and sank several hours later, claiming some 1,522 lives.The photo and the letter are now being sold at auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son of Devizes, Wilts, for an estimated £12,000 ($15,000).No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.The British economy may never fully recover from the severe impact of the coronavirus pandemic, a new report by the Tony Blair Institute has warned.Examining the effects of the lockdown – described as a “Great Pause” in the economy – the organisation claims Covid-19 is likely to cause “permanent damage” with declining tax receipts and surging levels of national debt.It comes as senior civil servants admitted the economic fallout from a pandemic hitting the UK was never modelled – despite the risk of a virus being one of the country’s most severe threats.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOutlining two major risks to future public finances, the Institute, set up by the former Labour prime minister, also urges government to gradually remove support for the economy, rather than withdrawing measures too quickly that could “exacerbate” long-term damage.“First, the economy may never fully recover from the pandemic,” the report claims. “If this is the case, tax revenues will be permanently lower than they would have been, and budget deficits structurally larger.”Created with Sketch.How coronavirus lockdowns changed the world\u0027s most polluted cities Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.It continues: “Under plausible assumptions of a permanent reduction in economy capacity of between three and seven per cent, without any policy action, debt would start rising again and only stabilise at levels of more than 100 per cent of GDP. “But here too, at current low interests rates even historically high levels of debt would pose no affordability problem, with debt service costs remaining at record lows.”However, the report also warns that despite low interest rates, the situation could change radically if interest rates begin to return to historical norms, adding: “If interest rates started to rise from 2025 to reach these levels by 2040, the government’s ceiling on the debt interest to revenue ratio of six per cent would swiftly be breached and debt service costs would be on a path to exceed post-war records substantially.”The authors pointed out that in the “worst-case scenario”, damage to the economy could see “debt return to levels last seen in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, by the end of this decade”.‘Millions of jobs at risk’ as UK economy shrinks by a fifthBut they said: “Given the historically low interest rates, even such eye-watering debt would be affordable.”James Browne, the health of work, income and inequality analysis at the Institute, added: “The national debt will rise dramatically during the pandemic. Low interest rates mean that the burden on public finances will be light, however, so we shouldn’t worry about doing whatever it takes now to minimise long-term economic damage. “But in the longer run it would be a dangerous gamble to assume that interest rates will stay low forever, so the government should make sure debt is falling as a share of national income to ensure fiscal sustainability.” The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Dr Clare Gardiner told MPs the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) centre was already providing national level data to ministers. But Dr Gardiner, who has been in her job less than a week, said the organisation would not be fully able to do the same on a local level until the end of the summer. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer forecast comes amid growing questions over the government’s plans for ‘local lockdowns’, if another outbreak hits. The government wants to avoid a repeat of the national lockdown, by isolating ‘clusters’ as soon as they are identified. But local government sources have expressed exasperation at what they say is a lack of information about how and when their communities are supposed to implement a local lockdown. Dr Gardiner told MPs on the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee: “The capability we are trying to build is quite complex and it will take time. The expectation is that we will be at full (capacity) by the end of the summer”. The centre was announced with great fanfare as part of the UK’s road map out of lockdown last month. Part of NHS test and trace contact tracing programme, it is designed to be an  early warning system.However, it has already proved controversial. It was initially supposed to set the government’s Covid-19 ‘alert level’, to communicate the current level of risk. But No 10 was later forced to say it would inform that decision, after the intervention of the government’s medical advisers.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Wearing face coverings is to be compulsory on public transport in England from 15 June, with fines for those who refuse, transport secretary Grant Shapps has announced.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Mr Shapps said the move was designed to prevent an upsurge in coronavirus infections as the country moves to the next stage of lockdown relaxation, with non-essential shops allowed to reopen.Mr Shapps said wearing a face covering would be made a “condition of travel” on public transport, allowing passengers to be refused carriage if they do not comply, with the British Transport Police called in to deal with those resisting the rule where necessary. Face coverings are not currently included in the Health Protection Regulations which give the police legal power to take action over lockdown breaches. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Shapps said: “As of Monday 15 June face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.“That doesn’t mean surgical masks, which we must keep for clinical settings. It means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home. There will be exemptions to these rules for very young children, for disabled people and those with breathing difficulties.”He added: “We need to ensure every precaution is taken on buses, trains, aircraft, and on ferries.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“With more people using transport, the evidence suggests wearing face coverings offers some – albeit limited – protection against the spread for the virus.”Frontline staff such as bus drivers will also be required to wear face coverings, and Mr Shapps said the government will work with devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to try to make the change nationwide.The announcement was welcomed by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who has long lobbied for mandatory face coverings on the capital’s Underground system.“I’m pleased that our lobbying has paid off and the government has finally seen sense and made it mandatory for people to wear face coverings on public transport,” said Mr Khan.Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, agreed: “This is a sensible step. We have been working closely with the government to ensure that agreed increases in services on Britain’s train and Tube network is done in a safe and controlled manner, to help spread the loading, and maintain social distancing for the safety of passengers and staff.“The instruction to wear face coverings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus will ease the concerns of people travelling, and working, on the transport network.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailHowever, scientists are ided over the value of homemade face coverings.Dr Antonio Lazzarino, of the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London, warned that their use might encourage people to wash hands less and to make more use of buses and trains, where face coverings will offer no protection against them being infected by touching handrails contaminated with the virus.“It is now commonly accepted that face coverings provide very little protection, if any. But one clear, logical, widely accepted side effect is that face coverings may give an excuse to easing other more important measures,” said Dr Lazzarino.“Will more people use the Tube or buses because they will feel more secure given that everybody wears a face covering? This will increase the risk of transmission.“Will people be able not to contaminate their hands and the handrails by not touching their face coverings and not touching the handrails while standing inside buses and trains? This seems to be impossible to me. Face coverings can therefore be a vehicle of infection, rather than a barrier.”But health care professor Prof Trish Greenhalgh of the University of Oxford said: “Face coverings aren’t 100 per cent effective, but they’re not zero per cent effective either.“I’ve seen evidence that a double layer of cloth is between 60 and 90 per cent effective in stopping the spread of viral-laden droplets coming from the wearer, and also that the same mask is also 30-50 per cent effective at stopping virus particles getting to the wearer. You can argue about the exact percentages, but overall, if everyone wears a face covering when they’re at close quarters, transmission is going to go down dramatically.”Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: “This policy will add more burden on the general public to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This is much more complicated than ‘wash your hands for 20 seconds’ or ‘stay at home’. We are asking the whole population of Britain, with no prior experience of mask-wearing, to overnight become competent makers, wearers, and maintainers of PPE.“I have seen no new evidence to suggest why the government is reversing its previous policy, and ignoring its previous scientific guidance and the guidance of the WHO. I’m left wondering if this is a political decision, rather than one based on science.”Labour’s shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: “This is just another example of the government being slow to act. Two months ago, Labour immediately backed the Mayor of London’s call for face coverings on public transport to be compulsory. Yet only now Tory ministers are acting.“Two months after first raising this with government we are still yet to hear whether drivers will be issued with gloves, masks, and other PPE items as standard, what specification this PPE should be and, if there isn’t sufficient PPE, whether buses should still run.“We can’t go on like this. We need a comprehensive transport plan to get our public transport moving, to protect staff and to protect passengers.”Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy said he expected most passengers to comply with the requirement to wear face coverings.“I am not expecting a huge upsurge in railway staff having to police this,” he told the No 10 briefing. “I am expecting sensible passengers to do their duty and look after themselves and others.”Mr Shapps said that if people refused to comply they could be fined under new provisions in the national rail conditions of travel and the public service vehicle regulations for buses.“It is a condition of travel. You cannot travel unless you are wearing a face covering,” he said. “There will also be other powers so it could ultimately lead to fines. I very much hope we won’t be in that situation.”He said he did not expect enforcement action to be required on a regular basis, saying: “I expect the vast majority of people won’t need to be forced into this, because wearing a face covering helps protect others and most people simply want to help defeat this disease.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

John Lewis reopening two branches in Poole and Kingston-upon-Thames, while Argos opened 145 out of more than 800 stores.Primark took a different approach, reopening all of its 153 stores, and enjoying crowds at several of them, including its flagship Oxford Street store in London. The budget clothing specialist has been hit harder than most by the lockdown as it does not have an online storefront, meaning goods have been left stacked up in warehouses or on shelves. One shopper at Birmingham’s Primark store said it had been “a delight” to return to the city centre shop, which like other stores saw large queues that morning.She told the PA news agency: “It took a long time but I bought a lot of dresses, nightwear and bras. I have missed it a lot and I’m really happy.”Other shoppers were less pleased with the extended queues. Kristina Taylor, 40, who works in finance, told PA: “I just need to have my screen protector replaced, that’s all. It’s just something that has been niggling me since day one.”Asked if she was pleased about shops reopening, she said: “Yes and no.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But not keen on all of this queueing, it makes me think twice about whether I need something from that shop.”Certain shops face particular challenges in complying with government guidance, such as shoe retailers which now have to “quarantine” pairs that customers have tried on. Changing rooms at most clothes shops remained closed while bookshops took items off shelves after people have touched them. Waterstones will only return items to the shop floor after 72 hours.Shops are required to install screens at checkouts and mark two-metre distance intervals on the floor to help customers stay apart. Retailers including Ikea and John Lewis have introduced social distancing wardens to help with this.As with supermarkets, numbers within non-essential stores will be strictly limited, meaning shoppers will be faced with queues outside.Councils urged shoppers to take extra care when visiting high streets and town centres to avoid a second spike in coronavirus infections.To make visits to town centres and high streets safe, councils are carrying out more frequent street cleaning, providing hand-sanitiser posts, adapting public seating and conveniences, creating more pedestrianised spaces on streets and deploying council staff or volunteers to provide help and advice.Government ministers have also tried their best to give people the confidence to return to high streets and shopping centres. Paul Scully, minister for small businesses, told BBC Breakfast: “The high street is going to be a different place to what it was before, with the one-way systems, with the hand sanitisers, and with people not trying clothes on in the same way.” He echoed Boris Johnson who said on Sunday that people “should shop and shop with confidence”.Shops have been asked to encourage customers to shop alone unless they need extra assistance and to adjust routes around stores to minimise congestion.Given the constraints in place, retailers face a tough challenge encouraging some reluctant consumers back into stores.While there is likely to be some pent-up demand as people have the chance to browse and shop in a way they have not been able to since March, millions of consumers remain wary of public spaces while others are concerned about their finances.What are the lockdown rules now and what can you do from today?Indications from other countries is that footfall on high streets will, unsurprisingly, increase as shops reopen but that this may not translate into sales.That puts Britain’s struggling high streets in an even more perilous position as shops face high costs on rents and wages, for example, but greatly reduced revenues.David Fox, co-head of retail at property advisers Colliers, said: “Due to the social distancing measures and strict government protocols that retailers need to adhere to, there will be a mismatch of customers desire to shop and businesses ability to meet the demand. “The difficulty for retailers will be the logistics of the new health, safety and hygiene policies within the stores, with skeleton staffing to manage queueing and perform their sales duties.”Those shoppers who do venture out may be able to pick up bargains, particularly if they can hold off on purchases for a couple of weeks.Primark revealed recently that it had £1.9bn-worth of items in stock, more than double the amount it would usually hold. By one estimate, fashion retailers have around £15bn of unsold garments. Shoppers may be able to take advantage of heavy discounts as chains try to sell this excess before it falls out of fashion.However, some experts think retailers will hold off before slashing prices. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at consultancy firm PwC said it was unlikely that consumers would see “wall-to-wall sales” this week.Many retailers have already offered big discounts online, with promotions reaching levels normally only seen on Black Friday.Ms Hooker predicts a bounce in sales this month. “If June trading does not make a big enough dent in stocks, we predict a rush of promotions and sales later in the summer.”Oxfam said charity shops are likely to be packed with “gems” as they reopen this week and fill up with items that people have cleared out during lockdown.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.The United States’ coronavirus pandemic  passed another sombre milestone on Wednesday as confirmed cases surpassed two million, according to John Hopkins University data.Five US states - New York, New Jersey, California, Illinois, and Massachusetts - have seen more than 100,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases each. Almost 210,000 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in New York City alone since the US pandemic began, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhilst one million Americans contracted the virus within the initial three months of the pandemic, the past one million cases were contracted within six weeks, according to the data.  The US also continues to have more confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths – which have passed 112,000 – than any other nation.The National Center for Disaster Preparedness (NCDP), issued a warning this week that the US case count was “multiples more” than the confirmed two million.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?US authorities have otherwise claimed that high testing levels were contributing to the confirmed case count, in comparison to other states and international data.Whilst new coronavirus cases have declined in some parts of the US, including New York, there are now 20 states with rising infection rates as states ease some restrictions. California, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona are among 20 states with more cases on average in the past week, according to New York Times analysis. Arizona alone has seen, on average, more than 1,000 new cases each day this week. The highest per capita rate in the US. “It’s very clear that it’s a real increase in community spread,” Will Humble, Arizona Public Health Association executive director, told KJZZ in Phoenix. “It’s not some artifact of additional testing.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.China has removed pangolin parts from its list of traditional medicines, state-backed media reported, in a move campaigners say is a vital step in helping to protect the endangered animal.Pangolins – the world’s most trafficked mammal  – are highly sought after in China and Vietnam for their meat which is considered a delicacy, while their scales are used in traditional medicine and folk remedies.Similar in size to domestic cats and the only mammal covered in scales, all eight pangolin species are protected under international laws but there remains a growing illegal trade of the animals. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week health authorities omitted pangolin scales from China’s latest Pharmacopoeia, an approved list of traditional drugs and remedies due to “wild resources exhaustion”, according to a report in the Health Times.WildAid CEO Peter Knights said the move was “the greatest single action that could have been taken to save pangolins from extinction.”“The increased protection coupled with the swift and comprehensive closure of live wildlife markets and removal of many wild species from the list of what can be consumed as food in China were already very positive steps to saving the pangolin worldwide and reducing the possibility of them ever being a vector for disease.“And now this announcement, effectively the closure of legal sales of pangolin scales, shutting the last major loophole in pangolin protection efforts,” he added.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed China’s decision, but urged action to stop the sale of pangolins on the black market. “PETA gives a nod to China for taking an important step to combat the demand for pangolin scales,” director Elisa Allen told The Independent.“However, as long as it remains desirable and profitable for endangered animals’ body parts to be sold for medicine, wildlife will continue to be killed on the black market.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“We urge the Chinese government to clamp down on the use of animal-derived substances for medicine – whether it’s pangolin scales, donkey skin for ejiao, or horse urine for Premarin, which is also an issue in the West.”The move comes after China’s forestry authority last week upgraded the status of pangolins to “first-level protected wild animal,” the highest possible protection status alongside pandas and tigers.Trade in pangolins is banned in China but it is estimated that between 116,990 and 233,980 were killed between 2011 and 2013, according to the World Wildlife Fund, but experts fears those numbers are just the tip of the iceberg.Last year alone, authorities seized more than 130 tons of pangolin related products, a figure estimated to represent up to 400,000 animals, according to conservation group WildAid.Gilbert Sape, Head of Traditional Medicine at World Animal Protection called for a permanent ban on wildlife trade, saying it wwas ”the only long-term solution to keeping wild animals wild, eliminating animal suffering, and all importantly, preventing major health epidemics.”Pangolins eat ants, termites and larvae. Some scientists believe they may incubate the Covid-19 virus that is thought to have emerged in Wuhan last year and has since swept the globe.Scientists find virus similar to Covid-19 in pangolinsFollowing the outbreak of coronavirus at the end of last year, China banned the consumption of all wild animals in a bid to prevent further outbreaks but many wet markets have since reopened.Earlier this year, The Independent renewed its call for the banning of trade in wild animals to help protect endangered species and avoid future pandemics.“These actions of China will have a real impact, these are steps that were critical, that needed to be taken if real conservation was going to happen for these animals,” said David Olson, director of Conservation at WWF Hong Kong.“Most of the demand for pangolin is coming from traditional Chinese medicine and consumption. That’s what is driving this large scale illegal trade.”With additional reporting by Louise Boyle Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Publishers and developers will choose whether to implement it on their games, meaning that some third-party titles could have to be bought twice, if those making them decide so.It means that if anyone buys a game now – such as Gears 5 – for the current generation of Xbox, all they will have to do is push a button on their Xbox Series X when it is released to download the version of the title fully updated and optimised for the new console.Xbox Series X will be \u0027most compatible console ever\u0027, says MicrosoftLikewise, players will be able to buy Halo Infinite when it comes out alongside the Xbox Series X, and play it on both the new console they may put in their living room as well as the Xbox One that may be demoted to the bedroom, Microsoft noted.Not all games will be ready when the new version of the Xbox is released. Microsoft pointed to the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077, for instance, which will be released in September that will not be optimised for the Xbox Series X at launch, but players will be able to play it on their new console in compatibility mode until the fully optimised version arrives later on.All of those games will allow saved games and progress to move forward onto the new console, too, meaning that players will be able to pick up where they started on the previous generation.Microsoft gave a brief list of all the games that are optimised for Xbox Series X and are confirmed to support smart delivery, which included Halo Infinite and Cyberpunk 2077.

So it is extremely confusing why Prince Andrew is resisting demands to meet US officials probing convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his associates.Department of Justice investigators want to speak to Andrew as a witness. Jeffrey Epstein killed himself in August last year, taking many of his depraved secrets to the grave.Despite this, Andrew has, according to US prosecutors, “repeatedly declined” a request to be interviewed and had “unequivocally” stated he would not come in for one.Instead, his lawyers say he has offered to provide a witness statement, which is not quite the same.Although I guess he knows that already, having submitted to the car crash Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis, during which he kept digging the hole he was in.If Andrew has got nothing to hide about his relationship with Jeffery Epstein, why did he request to communicate with the FBI through a written statement Friends of the duke this week claimed he was “utterly bewildered” by accusations that he was refusing to help US investigators.But it all just feels a bit . . . murky, doesn’t it He should jump at the chance of properly explaining his relationship with Epstein and his close friend Ghislaine Maxwell.She has been accused of acting as a pimp for Epstein — which her lawyers have denied — and has vanished.No doubt the duke has spent the past few months hoping this story will just go away, or be eclipsed by other, bigger news events. But clearly, this story is going nowhere.The bottom line is thatthe authorities in the US want to interview him, he must speak to them.Then he can repair his reputation and that of the wider Royal Family.He needs to restore the public’s trust in him. In his Newsnight interview he referred to himself, repeatedly, as “honourable”.Well, now is the time to prove it. Just step up, do the FBI interview and get it over and done with.And in all of this furore, let’s not forget Epstein’s victims. If Prince Andrew can shed any light on Epstein, who killed himself before he could go to trial for new sex trafficking charges, then why won’t he Perhaps he feels that, as a member of the Royal Family, he should not be subject to the same kind of scrutiny as “ordinary” people.But that line of thinking won’t cut the mustard in light of the seriousness of the allegations about Epstein — and those who benefitted from spending time with him.Anyone who watched the documentary about victim Virginia Roberts, Epstein and Prince Andrew will agree that it seems unlikely that anyone who knew Epstein would have known something was not right.I knowI had seen what is alleged, I would have walked straight out and to the first police station.But perhaps he can persuade prosecutors otherwise. And anyway, what is plain to see is that Andrew will only get his le back once he has answered some questions and cleared his name.In the meantime, though, I have another, possibly more pressing question that I would like answered: Where the hell has Ghislaine Maxwell disappeared to, and why is she not being interviewed about her role in all of this A good education closes the gap between the advantaged and the disadvantaged. The better your education, the more career choices you have.So when schools closed in March and we were all told to stay at home, a plan for how to reopen them should have been an absolute priority from day one.But schools are still closed to most children – indefinitely and with no firm or credible plan for them to reopen, even in September.We can go to Thorpe Park. We can go to Ikea. But our children cannot go to school.In the meantime, an estimated , kids are currently doing no school-work at all.No one disagrees that lockdown should have included schools. But they need to reopen as soon as it is safe to do so.That might mean cutting class sizes from  to . It might mean half-days for children or twice as many classrooms and teachers, plus proper arrangements for social-distancing.These things all need managing and organising. So why don’t schools ask local business leaders to help with the logistics This is a national crisis and it is turning into a national emergency, as the gulf between the haves and have-nots widens.Of course, some families will not be comfortable sending their children to school. If that is the case, it should be their choice not to send them.But we need to get schools open again, fast.I had a little chuckle while reading the interview with Oscar-winning actress Cate Blanchett.With her four children and long-standing marriage, she seemingly has it all.But I loved her honesty about the reality of home-schooling her kids while also trying to work during lockdown.Cate said: “I know, as a working mother who identies as a feminist . . . it’s a very rare partnership where the men also accept that responsibility in making things work.”She added that her husband, Andrew Upton, bought her a vacuum cleaner for their first anniversary and has also given her a mixer and an ironing board.It could have been me talking, except I wasn’t given a vacuum cleaner.I was given a frying pan.A hospital costs about £million but without doctors and nurses there is no point.So perhaps I would suggest the money goes towards emergency funding to train hospital staff.What would NOT be on my list, though, is a new royal yacht. Yet that is exactly what former trade minister Lord Digby Jones has called for, to lt the nation’s spirits in the wake of the Covid- lockdown.Somehow, I doubt the Queen – who famously uses Tupperware to keep her breakfast cereal fresh – would agree that a new yacht is what is needed in these tough economic times.She might deserve it but wouldn’t want it.There are so many reasons to love the flute-playing American rapper Lizzo.This week she gave us another, with a tweet showing footage of her working out in many dferent guises.A voiceover said: “I’ve been working out consistently for the past five years – and it may come as a surprise to some of y’all that I’m not working out to have your ideal body type.“I’m working out to have MY ideal body type.“And you know what that is  None of your fing business. Because I am beautul. I am strong. I do my job.”I love this message, which is true in so many ways. I really hope women, young and old, take note. Love yourself and, seriously, don’t give a rat’s a what anyone  thinks.Litter – and worse.One green space near me has a sign up saying: “This is a park, not a toilet.”What happened to us during lockdown that we think it is OK to behave like this  Come on, people. We can do better.Having said that, maybe the council needs to put out some more bins.In the Nineties, it seemed barely a day went by without front-page shots of Kate Moss looking worse for wear after a night on the tiles.But those days are gone and there is something strangely comforting about Kate, who is now teetotal, needing to be in bed by pm so she gets her eight hours.Maybe that’s why she still looks so good. She spent years being there and doing that – now it’s time to get her beauty sleep.Not drinking has many benefits. I feel so much better at the end of Dry January than I do end after boozy December. Good for her.It was heartwarming to see Prince Philip in such fine fettle as he turned  last week.I love how dapper he still is. And he has good health, a strong marriage and great wit – le goals for all of us.I do hope he will be celebrating his th birthday – and beyond.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The PM said this afternoon:to put a tiger in the tank because its very clear what the UK needs and our EU friends need.I dont think were that far apart but what we need to see now is a bit of oomph in the negotiations and I was very pleased that Ursula von Der Leyenall agreed to sign up to a good statement to take us forward. What we all really said is the faster we can do this the better - there is no reason why you shouldnt get this done in July.Mr Johnson told the President of the European Council Charles Michel, President of the EU Commission Ms von der Leyen and President of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, there needs to be a renewed energy and commitment in negotiations. The PM will push forward with leaving the EU on December  with or without a deal. A spokesperson for No said this lunchtime: We now need to get this resolved and deliver certainty for businesses at home and in the EUWhatever happens, we will be ready for January  where we will take control of our laws, borders and our money.We have agreed a programme for intensied discussions beginning next month.Ms Von der Leyen said today: The EU is ready to intensy the talks, we are available  . Let’s inject fresh momentum into the negotiations.The efforts to speed up the timetable come after the World Trade Organisation boss warned Britains recovery from COVID- could be hampered by no-deal. A joint UK-EU statement after the talks today stressed the transition period would end at the end of the year, despite EU bosses pushing for an extending because of coronavirus. The statement said: The Paties agreed nevertheless that new momentum was required. They supported the plans agreed by Chief Negotiators to intensy the talks in July and to create the most conducive conditions for concluding and ratying a deal before the end of .The Parties underlined their intention to work hard to deliver a relationship, which would work in the interests of the citizens of the Union and of the United Kingdom. The WTO has predicted that global trade could fall by a third because of the pandemic.WTO director-general Roberto Azevêdo warned the car industry and agriculture would be among the worst hit sectorsBritain didnt thrash out a deal with the bloc. The PM is expected to go to great s to protect jobs in the car industry in a speech to reboot the economy next month. One of the policies could offer Brits up to £, to trade in old diesel and petrols cars for electric cars in a bid to boost sales at companies such as Nissan who employ thousands at their Sunderland factory. But Mr Azevêdo said they would be subjected to heavy tarfsthe UK defaults to WTO trading rules under a no-deal Brexit. Mr Johnson wants a deal which gives Britain tarf-free access to EU markets but he has insisted the nation has nothing to fear by trading on WTO terms. The PM has stressed giving business certainty there will be no extension to the transition period with the EU - where the UK still has to follow the blocs rules - is more important. Mr Azevêdo told The Andrew Marr Show on BBC One WTO trade rules were not a catastrophe he said they “will impose a number of adjustments and those can be painful, particularly for some sectors”.He added: The less disruption the better, the less turbulence the better, and less turbulence is the closest to where you were before. Soyou can maintain the degree of integration and relationship that you had before Brexit, it is less traumatic thanyou have to go to WTO terms. The WTO boss thought there was a good chance the UK and EU would find a dealthere is political will to do so. He said: If people realise that a no-deal scenario is much less than optimal, Im pretty confident that negotiators could do this in a reasonable way with a reasonable time frame.

Funny old world.”Another said: “ may never have been established without financial benefits arising from slavery.”One added: “All people who have written for thein the past and right now ought to be ashamed at their support of slavery.”The newspaper has tried to address its past, with associate editor and columnist Martin Kettle trying to explain it in .He claimed: “s stance on the US civil war was of its era.“The issue that caused the problem for thewas not slavery.had always hated slavery.

Our kids were excited about the day ahead. Jo was up in Batley for the day where she was the MP, ready for a day of surgeries and helping local people, the part of the job she loved most. A few hours later Jo had been killed and reeling with shock and pain I was working out how to tell the children. There is absolutely nothing worse. In the years since we have sought to rebuild our lives, always trying to focus not on how she died or how crushing it is to lose her energy and love, but how lucky we were to have her in our lives for so long and how we still feel her love every single day.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at mirror email -after the press conference every evening. Jo was an optimistic person, passionate and empathetic. As a family we often think about what she is missing out on, the things we would give anything for her to experience just for a moment. Sometimes I also think about what politics is missing with her not here. Because Jo was an optimist. She believed in people and in our country. She was always someone who sought to find out what was good in someone rather than just focus on their faults. And our country needs that now more than ever. The phrase “more in common” – from her maiden speech - has come to define Jo. That phrase was never to suggest we don’t have dferences or shouldn’t disagree with each other – of course we should. It’s about trying to recognise that these dferences and disagreements shouldn’t define or ide us. The corona crisis is of course something that Jo wouldn’t have imagined, certainly not its scale and severity. But she would have guessed that one of the few positives to have come out of it is a sense of community spirit.We all have our own stories of neighbours looking out for each other, doing the shopping for vulnerable people or going to work to keep the rest of us supplied and healthy. And that feeling is supported in the polling. The number of people who say we look after each other has gone from % in February to % in May. The question now is can we keep this sense of community spirit going or will it fade as events overtake us  The answer to that question isn’t yet written. And what we all decide to do or not do will determine the outcome. That’s partly a question about our leaders and politicians – will they seek to ide us or bring us together, will they spread fear or reassurance  But it’s mostly about us, and what we decide to do. Whether we decide to keep building our own connections and communities eventhe threat of the virus fades.

A minister also said roads could shut to allow outdoor seating, pedestrianisation and more “temporary markets” to get the high street back on its feet. Two ministers dished a buffet of possibilities in Parliament as they tried to quell a Tory revolt over the two-metre social distancing rule.The PM has launched a review that could see it cut to one metre or . metres - and will listen to economists, not just experts on coronavirus.But Tory MPs are angry after he only promised to finish it in “the coming weeks” - despite pubs hoping to reopen in England from July . Today Health Minister Edward Argar told the House of Commons: “The current scientic advice is the two-metre rule signicantly reduces the risk of transmission and we have not yet beaten this disease.” But he added it is about striking the right balance between protecting public health outcomes and the impact on businesses. And under questioning, he hinted the review might let pubs cut the gap in exchange for extra protection. He repeatedly told MPs the two-metre rule is “not a binary choice” - and said “dferent pieces in the jigsaw” will be taken into account. Tory MP Kevin Hollinrake askedthe two-metre gap might be cut in exchange for compulsory face coverings in pubs and restaurants, when moving to and from a table.Mr Argar replied: “He’s right to allude to other measures within that package, that menu of options, which will of course be taken into consideration in this review”. SNP MP Philippa Whitford suggested the two-metre rule might remain, but with measures when it’s not possible - such as mandatory face coverings, or “glass or perspex screens between tables in restaurants.”Mr Argar replied: “She’s right to highlight that broader context - it’s not just about distance, it’s about duration of contact, how close that contact was, whether there were measures in place to mitigate that, be it screens or other measures, theof time. “This is not a binary question. It’s not just the two-metre rule and nothing . We must look at it in the round. “That is exactly what this review will be doing, looking at all those factors in the round.”  Tory Bob Blackman called for two sets of rules - one indoors and one outdoors - to allow beer gardens to reopen. Mr Argar replied that this is exactly the kind of considerations the review will be looking at. It came moments after a second Tory minister, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick, told MPs he is considering more outdoor seating, closing roads to cars and allowing marquees outside pubs to boost the high street. Calling for a “vibrant cafe culture”, Mr Jenrick said: I would like to see more outdoor seating, for that to be easier and cheaper for small businesses to get licences for. More temporary markets, more pedestrianisation and for it to be easier to do things like put marquees outside pubs for longer this summer. All the things we need to do to help our economy to get going in the summer months, and I will be working with local councils to bring forward our proposals very shortly. Pub giants, backed by Tory MPs, warn keeping the two-metre distance will make it impossible for them to break even.

Here, she explains how...A couple of weeks after lockdown started, I found myself on the other side of London in a housing estate I didn’t know, trying to find a young woman I had never met before. She was a refugee, pregnant, alone and living in temporary accommodation. It was pouring with rain and I was standing in a stairwell as, in broken English, she was trying to explain over the phone how I could find her. When I finally got to her doorstep, I couldn’t even smile at her because I was wearing a face mask. And social distancing rules meant I couldn’t go in to sit down, have a cup of tea and explain the things in the box I was bringing her, as I would do normally. But as she stood in her doorway, I could tell she was really excited.  Hours later, we received a text message. It said how happy and delighted she was with the things we had brought her – that now she finally felt ready to have her baby, which she hadn’t before. It was such a moving moment.We normally have a core group of  volunteers, but since coronavirus it has just been me and my daughter Rosa, , running everything. So we decided to concentrate on baby boxes for newborns. They contain a sling, a steriliser and a breast pump as well as baby clothes, nappies, wet wipes, nappy cream and hygiene stuff for the mother. We’ve even started putting in a couple of loo rolls. It has been a struggle, but we have been helped enormously by National Lottery funding. And because lockdown has made it dficult to accept donations, where necessary we have also been able to afford a few bits to put in the boxes. The grant from The National Lottery has been a leline for us, allowing us to keep giving out our boxes which, in turn, the mothers say are their leline. Meanwhile, in Kent, another National Lottery-funded project, Youth Sports Trust, is tackling a problem facing young people - fitness and staying connected with friends... Sport is keeping kids connected  Teacher Guy Wilkins works closely with children’s charity Youth Sport Trust to enable children and young people to access competitive sport, training opportunities and learning leadership skills - and lockdown hasnapost put a stop to that. The -year-old, from Kentaposs Marjorie McClure School, said: During lockdown we’ve been running online meetings, setting physical challenges and sharing ideas for PE at home - such as ‘washing line tennis’ - to bring people even closer together. Many of us also got involved with the charity . challenge. For example, one of our students, James,  – who is a massive Crystal Palace fan – did  keepy-uppies.” Jamesaposs mum Wendy said the charity has been a vital link to the outside world for her son - and he has loved embracing the challenges. She told us: James has really benefited from having regular Zoom calls from school with his form tutor and Guy, as well as Tom who runs the after school cricket club which James attends.  James loves to have a look at these ideas and try out as many as he can. They suggested that the pupils try the daily Joe Wicks sessions as a fitness challenge and heaposs ended up doing them most days. The school challenged the pupils to take part in the . challenge so James ran walked .km and made a donation to the Bromley Mencap charity. Guy’s school – which is one of a network of six YST inclusive schools across South London – receives up to £, of National Lottery funding each year. This money helps to pay for leadership opportunities, give young people training to increase self esteem, confidence and communication skills, and the opportunity to experience badminton, volleyball, wheelchair basketball and athletics at inclusive sports festivals.They will also be taking part in YST’s National School Sport Week at Home, taking place from  to  June.

Science Museum fans flock online  Natasha McEnroe is the Science Museumaposs Keeper of Medicine. She explained: “The first year of opening for the Science Museumaposs new aposMedicine: The Wellcome Galleriesapos hasn’t at all been what I envisaged. “We were only open for five months before we had to close, and it was especially sad because we’d been lucky enough to have glowing press and visitor feedback.“Since lockdown we’ve been focusing on really pushing our digital delivery - which you can explore here . We are working on our oral history programme and - as part of a larger digitisation project, we’re photographing more than , objects from our collections – from space suits to Tracy the transgenic sheep. There’s also a very extensive  blog  and  learning resources and going online makes everything accessible to a much wider audience. “Some of our most searched items have been pieces including historic hospital ventilators.” The newly-opened Medicine Galleries - which were part funded by an £million grant from The National Lottery Heritage Fund - have proved a huge hit since moving online. In April, online visits to the Science Museum Group’s learning resources increased by % over an average month, with visits to the online collection in May breaking all previous records.

Luke Horsfield, , from Bradford, West Yorkshire, was worried about his thinning hairline so found a clinic in Turkey that would perform a transplant for half the price it would be in the UK. Yet after flying over there for the six-hour operation, the -year-old was left scars and bald patches and no sign of any hair regrowth months after. Luke claims surgeons at the clinic couldnapost speak English and took too many follicular units from the back of his head during the op which left him scarred. The procedure, known as follicular unit extraction, sees hair follicles removed from the side and back of a patientaposs scalp and injected into the front where the balding occurs. He claims this lead to further thinning of his hair, scarring and bald patches and he eventually needed it repaired by another clinic. The clinicaposs website claims to give effective results for men experiencing thinning hair and promises the hairline will regrow. Luke, an IT technician, is now issuing a warning to others contemplating the procedure to properly do their research before undergoing treatment. He said: I did everything they told me to do as aftercare once I had the operation. But after four months, I saw literally no growth. I rang them to ask why it hadnapost grown, but I was told this was normal. It got six months and there was a little bit of growth but not much and after a year it still hadnapost grown. I was left with scars and bald patches.  Luke, who had the op in December , said his complaints fell on deaf ears and when he asked for a refund, they even offered him another operation for half the price. They eventually offered Luke a £ refund, barely a third of what he paid for the botch job. Luke, who began noticing his hairline was thinning at , said he thought he had found a bargain deal, but has now urged other men to fully research procedures and clinics. He added: I had always been really self-conscious about my hair and I hated it being wet or getting blown in the wind.  Iaposd always spend extra time styling it before going out, trying to hide my bald spot. It was affecting my confidence and my self-esteem and it was something Iaposd been wanting to do a few years. I looked into it and a lot of the places offering the treatment in the UK charged around £,, but they were offering it for £,. They had great reviews on sites like Trust Pilot, so I thought I was getting good value for money. What I didnapost know then was that you anyone can post a review and companies can ask for reviews to be taken down, so I feel like I wasnapost getting a full picture. Luke posted a review of his operation and treatment on YouTube and was contacted by the Hair Dr clinic in the UK offering to repair the botch job for free. Luke went under the kne again at the Hair Draposs clinic in Dewsbury, West Yorks., on March , and was left delighted with the results. He added: The treatment I got at the Hair Dr was worldaposs apart. In Turkey, the surgeons didnapost even speak English so I had to communicate through a translator.  Theyaposve done a great job and Iaposve already noticed signs of growth in my hairline. Iaposd just encourage anyone to properly research the clinic and operations first. Dr Arshad, the lead surgeon at the Hair Dr transplant clinic, who carried out the repair procedure on Luke, said: When I was shown Lukeaposs YouTube video and account of what happened with his previous hair transplant in Turkey it really struck a cord with me as I see so many clients in this unfortunate position on an almost weekly basis. Before embarking on a hair transplant it is imperative that research is carried out on the clinic and the surgeon.

Around one in five pupils have carried out no schoolwork at home, or less than an hour a day, since schools closed partially in March, research by UCL Institute of Educationhas found. Researchers estimate this equates to approximately . million children across the UK. The study showed only % of children put in more than four hours of schoolwork a day. The findings come as ministers face pressure to get children back to school as soon as possible. Last week, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson was forced to admit defeat over plans for all primary schools to fully reopen before the summer holidays. The research, carried out at in April, suggests that children locked down at home in the UK spent an average of . hours each day doing schoolwork.

The Mayor of London told LBC tonight: This is part of the new normal. For the foreseeable future, I believe for the next year or so, wearing face coverings is going to become the norm rather than the exception. I was pleased when the PM accepted the need for us to wear face coverings on public transport, and make it mandatory. Mr Khan added wearing a face mask is one of the most unselfish things you can do. More than , extra staff including police officers are being deployed at stations to ensure people comply with the new rules. Passengers without a covering will be asked to wear one, or refused entry on board.  Those who repeatedly refuse will be subject to a penalty charge. The new rules apply to England and require anyone travelling by bus, coach, train, tram, Tube, ferry or plane to cover their face while on board. They exclude school transport, though Uber and Addison Lee have both made face coverings compulsory for passengers and drivers. The rules apply only while travelling - not while waiting - but the rail industry has asked people to cover their face as they enter a station.  People with certain health conditions, disabled people and children under the age of  are exempt from the rule. As well as on transport, all hospital visitors and outpatients also have to wear masks. The UK government changed its advice on face masks earlier this month, after it eased restrictions to get millions more people back to work.  It is now in line with the World Health Organisation which also advises on face coverings in small, public spaces - though itaposs not compulsory in stores and supermarkets. The rules do not apply in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland - but their governments recommend that people cover their faces in places where social distancing is dficult, including on public transport.

And a public appeal for financial help has raised more than £.million. But what the staff wanted more than anything was to see children enjoying seeing the animals once again. Ewa Dryglewska, , who helped ensure visitors observed social distancing at the penguin pool, said: “It is really lovely to see all the people again and I really believe the animals are excited too.” Steph Crone, , and her daughter Ellie, six, from Liverpool, are zoo members and would normally visit every couple of months. “Ellie was so excited to be coming back she was up at pm last night thinking it was already the morning” said post office worker Steph. “Everyone is just so happy to be out in the fresh air in a safe environment.” Victoria Rhodes, , and daughter Caitlin, four, from St Helens, Merseyside, are also regular visitors and were delighted to see the giraffes once again.  Student teacher Victoria said: “It is fantastic to see the zoo open again. It is a relief to be able to come where we know we can have a day out and know things are being arranged safely.” Bank manager Kerri Flowerday, , from Hawarden, north Wales, watched the elephants with her  month old daughter Imogen. “We have been waiting for it to open for months and we think it should have opened weeks ago” said Kerri. Hayley Wooley, , and husband Ste, , from Denton, Greater Manchester, had brought their sons Jax, five, and Louie, two, for a day at the zoo. They booked tickets as soon as the zoo announced it would be open for business again last week.  “The boys were so excited they could not even eat their breakfast” said Hayley. “Apart for a walk in the park, it is the first time we have had a day out for ages.” The zoo usually has around , visitors a day during the summer and had a record two million last year. But over the coming weeks it is limiting daily numbers to ,, with tickets only available online. Hand sanitisers and social distancing markers have been installed around the  acre site.

Chief Operating Officer Jamie Christon said: “Because we have been closed for such a long time it feels like a historic moment. “It was our th birthday last week and it has only been closed twice before, once for the Second World War and once because of foot and mouth, so we are delighted to have it open to the public.” But he warned: “We are definitely not out of the woods, we already have a £million hole in our finances this year and we will make a loss this year, which is the first time in at least a decade, so Covid has really left a deep financial scar on us. “It is going to take us two or three years to get us back to where we were,it ever happens.” "},{"url":null,"title":"hidden guests queens trooping colour","story":"NewsSecret guests at Queens Trooping the Colour spotted watching out the windowPrince Charles, Camilla, Kate Middleton, William, George, Charlotte and Louis were unable to joint the Queen for her official birthday celebrations this year, but some other very lucky people got some of the best seats in the houseShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video queen-appears-first-time-during-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The remarks came four years after Jo was fatally stabbed on the streets of Birstall by Thomas Mair, who held far-right views. Kim said: “I sometimes feel that I can’t really begin to deal with the grieving process while there is still so much work to be done on some of the issues Jo cared about during her le - and indeed the issues raised by her brutal murder at the hands of a right wing extremist and white supremacist. “In  how can we still be living in a world where people are abused, attacked and killed because of the colour of their skin  How can we still be living in a world where we are supposedly better connected than ever yet so many people feel lonely  And how can so many of us still be so reluctant or unable to listen to other peopleaposs opinions in a civilised and respectful manner ” Kim added that while she still felt pain at her sisteraposs death, I do continue to be inspired by how, when faced with tragedy and crisis, people often also show the best of humanity.

Mr Wolters told The Sun: We have written to the McCanns to tell them Madeleine is dead and explaining we just ­cannot say what the evidence is.“We have concrete evidence that our suspect has killed Madeleine. “British police have been informed but don’t have all the evidence we have.As a result, the familyaposs Portuguese lawyer Rogerio Alves has called on German police to share all evidence with Madeleineaposs parents.  However, Mr Wolters said while he sympathises with Kate and Gerry it might jeopardise the investigation. It would be easier for themI could tell them what we know but I can’t, he continued. All I can say is there is no forensic evidence but there is other evidence which indicates she is dead. Speaking from his office in the German city of Braunschweig, Mr Wolters told the Mirror: It is more important that we are successful and we are able to get the culprit, as opposed to just putting our cards on the table and tell them why we think she might be. He said there has been an increasing exchange of information between the German team, Scotland Yard and Portugal but admitted “not every detail has been passed on”.

A high-level meeting is due to take place between their Portuguese lawyer and detectives involved in the long-running probe. Pressure is mounting on authorities to come clean over what they know about tragic Madeleine’s fate. German prosecutors claim to have evidence she is dead but have so far refused to tell the McCanns what that is. However they have shared the information with Portuguese police, who last night described it as “signicant” and “very important”. Kate and Gerry’s lawyer Rogerio Alves is set to meet with detectives in a matter of days to be given an update on the investigation. He is hoping they will finally reveal what evidence the Germans have against suspect Christian Brueckner. Mr Alves said he will be meeting the Policia Judiciaria this week to find outthey are going to start actively investigating the case again. “I will try to find out what information they have that can support the reopening of the file here,” he said.  “I want to find outthere are new leads for them to chase. I want to know what is being done. “I intend to get answers on these matters this week. “What I hope is that everybody helps to find the truth instead of hiding information, or keeping information for themselves. “We are waiting for more information from the police and from the prosecutor.  “We are waiting for that information that should be provided to us, but there is nothing more we can do but wait. “According to Portuguese law,the prosecutor has new information about the crime he should reopen it. “I don’t know how strong the new evidence is so I don’t know what the prosecutor is going to do. “In terms of the investigation, and the parent’s hopes for justice, last week was a lost week.  “At the moment the police forces are arguing and this row is stupid. It seems they are trying to compete with each other. “Madeleine’s parents don’t want to know which police force thinks it is doing the best. They do not want a war of words. “It is no use – this is a waste of time. “All the police should be doing is trying to solve the case. I want to see full cooperation between the police forces.”  Last week Mr Alves branded German authorities “cruel” for refusing to say what evidence they have that Madeleine was killed. He said Kate and Gerry, of Rothley, Leics, “have a right to know” what happened to their daughter. “They need to know what’s going on,” he said. “It’s a question of legality but also humanity. It’s cruel.” It was claimed yesterday that Brueckner may be flown to Portugal to take part in a reconstruction of the night Madeleine disappeared.  It could prove key to unlocking the case and would be simple to organise once a formal German request is approved by Lisbon. Portuguese legal expert Rui Pereira told Correio da Manha newspaper that any reconstruction depends on countries working together. He said: “A number of procedures could be carried out under the umbrella of international co-operation. “The suspect could be flown to Portugal for the practice of judicial enactments that require him to be present.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper home delivery offer","story":"NewsGet The Mirror delivered free to your door for six weeksIts packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownShareByAlison PhillipsDaily Mirror Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  APR News\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The mistake will be a huge embarrassment for the Oxford Covid- vaccine trial viewed as being in pole position to produce the first jab. The first of  million doses for Brits had been expected to be approved as soon as September. Oxford University insists “no pause to the study is required” after a smaller dose was administered. The trial is the focus of scientists around the globe after it’s leaders took the unusual step of announcing before human trials that they were “% confident” the vaccine candidate would work. A working vaccine is the world’s main hope to resume normal le. Leading virologists told of their surprise at such a “simple error” with some fearing it could affect the trial results. Prof Ian Jones, Professor of Virology at the University of Reading, said: “Under-dosing is going to impact upon the clarity of the trial. “I’m very surprised and it’s very disappointing for them to find this and have to report it. I just hope they still get sufficient data to make it worthwhile.”  Leading UK virologist Prof Ravi Gupta, of Cambridge University, said: “It is fairly unusual for this to happen. “There can be issues when things are done quickly under lots of pressure that mistakes are made.”Thousands of jobs are riding on how quickly the UK can roll out an effective coronavirus vaccine and fully reopen the economy.Oxford has been backed by £ million in UK Government funding and has teamed up with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to manufacture its vaccine candidate. The Mirror can reveal the mistake as Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and France sign an agreement to pay £ million for  million doses. The university has now checked with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyabout the changed dose. Despite the error a spokesman insisted the dosages were safe and the clinical trial was “progressing well”. In a statement to the Daily Mirror it said: “The dose for the first part of the Phase   trial has been measured using one type of scientic test, and we are now switching to another way of measuring the dose which will give a slightly higher dose, that is similar to that used in our earlier Phase  trial.  “There is no concern about the change in dose and no pause in the study required by the UK regulator, MHRA.” The trial vaccine has now been given to , participants so far. The university did not say how many had been given the wrong dose but it is understood they will be written to and notied. The statement continued: “We monitor all trial participants very closely during the trial, assess regularly for Covid- and we are collecting blood samples to measure the immune response.” Promising news about the Oxford trial helped AstraZeneca’s share price soar to a record high recently. It came as a merger with rival pharma giant Gilead was being touted. There are currently  vaccines in human clinical trials worldwide according to the World Health Organisation. The Oxford trial is the only one in Europe with five in China and four in the US.  US scientists have been critical of the Oxford team for the claim that they were % confident their vaccine would succeed at the beginning of human trials. Dr William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and adviser to the US Government had said he “sat straight up” when he read it. “We don’t usually see that in public pronouncements,” he said. “Some of us in the scientic community here in the US have been a little surprised at the sprightly competitiveness of some of the comments from our colleagues at Oxford.” Dr Paul Offit, of the University of Pennsylvania, also said: “At this point the Oxford researchers have no idea whether they have something or not.” The vaccine - called ChAdOx nCoV- - was first given to  healthy adults in April in the first stage to see whether it was safe. The next stage of the trial involving , people at sites around the UK is to test whether it works. Participants are given a jab and then given regular tests to seethey have Covid-. At the end of the trial scientists will compare those given the vaccine to those given a placebo and evaluate whether it protected the vaccine group from contracting the virus. Prof Jones added: “Clearly there was a lot of activity around this vaccine being scaled up in to clinical trials and because of that a simple error could be made.

Emma Fegan, , rang the school where she was due to pick up one of her children before she left home to tell them that she would be late. But seven or eight minutes later, she was involved in a single vehicle accident which no-one witnessed. A farm worker, travelling with a colleague in a Land Rover in heavy rain, saw something which looked like debris on Hoveringham Road in Nottingham and they stopped.His workmate then saw what looked like a car in the River Trent, NottinghamshireLive reports.I could see a car on its roof upside down, the statement read. He called emergency services on his phone at .pm and the non-swimmer added I was hoping that someone who was inside the car was caught in an air bubble or something like that. The inquest heard about the rescue operation and how a person was found in the car and freed and taken to the Queenaposs Medical Centre for resuscitation and rewarming was attempted but was sadly unsuccessful. The virtual inquest heard the medical cause of death was immersion in water as a result of a single vehicle road traffic accident. Resident Joanne Connors did not go back down that road because it was quite severe when I went down it initially.She told assistant coroner Jonathan Straw: Itaposs not a busy road but, you know, itaposs quite seasonalthe weather is good everybody drove there. The weather was atrocious that day.Double decker school bus driver Tomasz Branski said thereaposs always a problem there when asked by the coroner about an area at an entrance to a farm where photos showed standing water. He said: When itaposs raining, sometimes the water is as deep as up to knee-level. He was travelling towards Caythorpe with children on board and had just approached a right hand bend when a black BMW came around the bend in the opposite direction. The coroner asked him: The BMW that came past you in the opposite direction, relative to the weather conditions, how would you say it was being driven  Mr Branski said it was definitely too fast, adding that he had to move towards the edge of the road, so I would not be hit by the vehicle. A family liaison officer, speaking on behalf of her husband, Richard, said at the point where the bus driver saw Emma the road was a mph speed limit. The BMW was a rear wheel drive and prone to being slippy on ice and in water. He had experience himself of aquaplaning in the car at mph. There was no forensic evidence to derive the precise speed at the point the BMW hit the standing water and lost control.

The Met Office says the UKaposs long-range forecast shows a repeat of the aposwall-to-wallapos sunshine seen at the end of May is unlikely. Millions in the UK are relying on fine weather to carry out rule-abiding social lives with friends and family parks and gardens during the ongoing coronavirus lockdown. Thunder and rain due to sweep through parts of the UK between tomorrow and Thursday puts a dampener on those plans as Juneaposs wash-out continues. Met Office spokesman Oli Clayden said the long-range weather forecast would so far dash hopes of an early summer scorcher. While the weather is looking set to improve once summer officially begins, there is no heatwave forecast in the next four weeks. Click here for the latest coronavirus news and updates   He told the : It doesnapost look like at the moment like thereaposs going to be the wall-to-wall sunshine and blue skies that we saw a few weeks back. But Mr Clayden said the forecast was monitored day by day, and could very likely change. The Met Office long range report predicts changeable weather through much of June, easing by early July. Many areas are likely to see a mixture of bright or sunny spells and showers, some of which may turn heavy in places, it continues.  It also forecasts temperatures around average or above what is expected for this time of year for the foreseeable future. The forecast for late June across the south of the UK warns of a risk of some spells of rain becoming heavy and possibly thundery. The east may remain cooler and cloudier during the same period. The weather is predicted to remain unsettled for the rest of June, then is forecast to settle in early July with prolonged drier and sunnier spells for much of the UK. However a chance of showers will remain, with temperatures predicted toto average.  The scorcher that bathed Brits in sunshine throughout late May was a relief for many in lockdown. But it also sparked concerns some were flouting social distancing guidelines, as the heatwave coincided with loosening rules and the late Bank Holiday weekend. Scenes of massive crowds and clf-jumpersapos tombstoningapos injuries at Durdle Door in Dorset drew particular outrage during the heatwave period. The death toll has soared past , and the UK has seen localised outbreaks in recent weeks, as the Covid- aposRapos transmission rates rose in areas including Englandaposs southwest. Scenes from packed beaches and parks led to fears people were increasingly ignoring the rules to gather outdoors in the sunshine.  The government has came under criticism for allowing people in England to drive wherever they wanted. People from dferent households in England can presently meet in groups of six in parks and gardens as long as they remain two-metres apart. The restrictions were eased as scientists say the risk of the virus being passed on is lower outdoors. The government has continued to encourage people who are not self-isolating to be outdoors and to exercise, citing mental health benefits.

We knew we needed to improve his fitness.“Once we got him fit – we needed to get him up to scratch and keep him playing at the same time – and got into his head in terms of how we played, he was great for us.“He was brilliant at taking the ball, getting us up the park and running past defenders, his pace was a major asset.“I didn’t have a lot of hair at the time but I still lost a bit because he would drive you bananas at times with some of the silly things he’d do in good positions.“It goes without saying that he’s matured well beyond that now. He might have lost a bit of pace in recent years but he is a seasoned campaigner.“Back then he was desperate to come up to Scotland and play games.“The big thing we sold him on was the area, the lestyle – the tranquillity up here compared to the hurly-burly down south.“We told him he could get himself on the TV, sell himself in the big games and we were the type of club thatsomeone came in for you with a decent offer, you’d have the option to go.”Hayes – who started out at Reading – eventually left for Aberdeen in  after three years with Inverness.Over  games in five seasons and a League Cup winners’ medal in the Granite City followed before he clinched a £ million move to Celtic.The winger struggled to establish himself as a Hoops regular but he started several crucial games for the Scottish champions, including the  Scottish Cup final triumph over Hearts and the stunning Europa League victory over Lazio in Rome last November.Two months earlier he grabbed the second goal in the Old Firm derby as Neil Lennon’s side beat Rangers - at Ibrox.Hayes’ Parkhead exit – which has also led to interest from his former employers at Pittodrie – came less than two weeks after he picked up his third title medal in three campaigns with the club.Malpas said: “I thought Jonny would’ve got another contract at Celtic and that he would happily have stayed.“But maybe they’re trimming their squad a bit to get players in and maybe there wasn’t going to be the chance to play as many games next season.“He certainly didn’t let Celtic down when he was called upon.“For United, though, good on them for trying to sign Jonny. They’re clearly thinking about the right players and I think that’s the type of player they need.“He’s experienced and he’s played at a very good level. He’s still got pace, he can play in more than one position and he’s good in a dressing room.“I thinkyou were struggling in the middle of the pitch he could do a job there as well.“You’d never say he was the best defender, but he never seems to get a doing from the wide players he plays against.“Sometimes you think he isn’t the best at beating people yet he always seems to get crosses in.“For us at Inverness he was great at getting the ball in the box and created a lot of goals for guys like Adam Rooney.”The former United captain saw a transformation in Hayes during his time with the Dons.He added: “I’ve followed Jonny’s career for years and hoped he would do well.“He was great for us and did everything we asked. He’s one of the many guys you like to think you’ve helped a bit.“Jonny’s really matured and looked after his fitness. At Aberdeen he was playing under a bit more pressure in front of a more demanding crowd and that helped him make the move to Celtic.“He was a cheeky chappie when we had him –he got a bit of stick, he’d give a bit back. Some things used to affect him but I could see a dference at Aberdeen, he’d outgrown that and he could handle that.“We had a great group at Inverness. When we went in, we only kept three or four players and started again.“Graeme Shinnie was one of the kids that was there and he has developed into a right good player as well.“These guys would run through a wall for you and they were a joy to work with.“We didn’t have great facilities but these guys wanted to learn, they wanted to work and they had a great attitude.”Dundee United appoint senior club representative to liaise with Terrors fan groups\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-fan-groups-liaison embed # secretNdKFhlJe\" data-secret\"NdKFhlJe\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this. It has been good to share some of the memories of Argyll with you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSend us a photograph of your family member or friend enjoying their special day and we will publish it and wish them a happy birthday.Remember to include their full name, age, where they are from and a bit about what you did to make the day at home special.Send your photographs to editor@argyllshireadvertiser"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe featured image this week was submitted by Aileen Gillies of Lochgilphead, who caught this stunning sunset on May  at Bellanoch bridge on the Crinan Canal."},{"url":null,"title":"plans in place for 2021 camanachd cup final","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFollowing the expected cancellation of shinty’s  cup competitions, the Camanachd Association has confirmed with title sponsor Tulloch Homes and Kingussie Camanachd Club that the plan to host the final in Kingussie will be postponed for a year and will now take place on September  .The Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup Final willto the Highland venue for the first time since  and for its th anniversary.First contested in , the final of shinty’s national knock-out cup competition promises to be a brilliant day out for all the family and a  chance to watch two of the country’s elite shinty teams.Hundreds of tickets have already been sold and to be part of this historic moment you can secure your tickets, including some exclusive offers, on shinty.The  final takes place at The Dell and will be one of the biggest stagings of the event in its -year history with live traditional music, entertainment and a dedicated Kids Zone adding to the festival feel.The first final of the Camanachd Cup took place at Inverness on April  .

This is a challenging operational environment for our aircrew and an extremely dficult period for our fundraising teams as the restrictions are preventing all the events, talks and activities taking place which are so essential to help support the country#s only charity-funded helicopter air ambulance service.It costs around £ million each year to fund our Perth and Aberdeen-based helicopter air ambulances.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

This can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.Before putting it on, you should wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and do the same after removing it.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store any used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose.Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched and wash the covering regularly.

kayak, is part of the proposals revealed by the local authority with a series of images also unveiled.The proposed ClimatEvolution Zone would cover the under-construction town of Blindwells and surroundingcommunities stretching from Prestonpans to Longniddry and inland to Tranent and Macmerry.East Lothian Council is petitioning the Scottish Government to extend the National Development status given to the former Cockenzie Power Station site in its National Planning Frameworkdocument to a wider area in its planned revised framework which is under review.This could pave the way for the creation of the ClimatEvolution Zone which could transform the area over the next  years through innovative approaches to development.A public consultation on the vision has been launched by the council and breaks the plans down into dferent themes from environment to travel.It asks people to give their views on its approach to a wide range of issues including access and movement the water environment culture, heritage and leisure greenspace and bioersity strong communities and regeneration and enterprise.However, the vision has already come under fire from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council which branded it ldquocomplex and unclear.The community council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of public consultations in  but the report remains an informal ldquovisionary document.Now the former power station site could be merged into the new ClimatEvolution Zone with no reference to the original masterplan.Bryan Hickman, community council chairman, said: ldquoThe community council are very concerned by the documents recently published by the council.\"We understood that the changes required for NPF related to the former power station site.\"The y report now extends to Tranent, Prestonpans, Cockenzie and Port Seton, Longniddry and Blindwells as well as the power station site.\"Whilst some of the objectives are to be welcomed, the overall content is complex and unclear and includes such a large area as to be unmanageable in its detail.ldquoThe existing communities have been consulted on the power station site and the result was a masterplan commissioned by the council but not adopted by them.\"We have submitted this masterplan to be included in NPF.\"A number of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with local communities who all have concerns about the impact of this development on their communities.The new consultation is based around a study, drawn up in partnership with East Lothian Council, the Scottish Government, The Lothian Drainage Partnership, SEPA, Scottish Water and Scottish Natural Heritage.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells and harness the latest technologies to reduce the arearsquos carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater at Blindwells to create waterways and using natural geothermic energy to heat the outdoor water features.Douglas Proudfoot, project leader, said the idea behind the new water features was to avoid putting pipes underground to remove groundwater and utilise it instead as the new town of Blindwells develops on the former opencast coal site of the same name between Longniddry and Tranent.The first houses are due to be built later this year.He said: ldquoWe have a unique opportunity here with a blank canvas for a new town at a time when climate change is central to policies.\"I also think the Covid- pandemic has driven forward the idea that people can work from home and find alternative ways to work with the support of digital technology.Central to the vision is alternative ways to travel with an emphasis on walkways and cycle routes.A new train station at a central hub within an area the council has dubbed Greater Blindwells will provide additional access to public transport.To the north of the central hub between Cockenzie and Port Seton and Longniddry there are proposals for a water park or outdoor leisure area with the potential to create a lido with space for kayaking and other water sports.At the former Cockenzie Power Station site, less than half-a-mile away, a new centre of excellence is proposed described as a training school and ldquoexemplar developmentin modular manufacture and construction.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray welcomed the ambitious strategy.He said: ldquoThe Cockenzie and Blindwells sites are adjacent to one another and it has always been inevitable that their development will be closely linked, so it makes sense to seek to extend National Development status to Blindwells.ldquoThe whole area offers unique potential to transform these former industrial sites into places where people can live and work in a sustainable way.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, also welcomed the project which will lsquointeractrsquo with neighbouring communities.He said: ldquoThe area is a far wider community and cannot be seen in isolation.The inclusion of adjacent communities is therefore essential.Councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the proposals are not a lsquofinalised masterplanrsquo but rather a ldquohigh level document which sets out an ambitious vision for the area over the coming  years.He said: ldquoItrsquos an exciting opportunity to ensure that one of the key areas of East Lothian, is developed in an innovative way.\"Itrsquos not all about whatrsquos new, though.\"We are looking at enhancing the existing local environment and making the most of the arearsquos unique history as well as its mining and agricultural heritage and the site of the Battle of Prestonpans.The council launched its eightweek consultation on its online hub on Monday.The Scottish Government is revising its National Development Planning Framework which gives an overview of what it wants to see develop on key sites across Scotland.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoWe are grateful for the many views and ideas received in response to early engagement on National Planning Framework  .Our analysis of the responses is underway and will continue over the summer, and we expect to publish an update in the autumn.The council consultation can be found at

The covering can be washed with other laundry, using your normal detergent.When wearing a face covering, take care to tuck away any loose ends.How do I stop my glasses from steaming up If you wear glasses, wearing a face mask at the same time can cause the lenses to steam up, making it dficult to see properly.But the common problem has an easy solution, thanks to advice from doctors in the medical journal Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.To prevent the issue, doctors advise washing your glasses with soapy water before putting the mask on, and rinsing them under warm water.Then, gently dry off the lenses with a clean towel or cloth before putting them back on.Washing the lenses with soapy water leaves behind a ldquothin surfactant film that reduces misting on the lenses, meaning they now shouldnrsquot steam up when a face mask is worn.Should face coverings be worn where The current government advice states that face coverings should be worn in enclosed spaces, which includes some shops and public transport.At the moment, people are not being told to wear them outdoors, while exercising, or in schools or offices.Several airlines, including easyJet and Ryanair, have introduced a requirement for passengers to wear face masks on board.However, the government believes that face masks should be reserved for people who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9466552.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"The make-up artist, who is a worldwide star on YouTube and Instagram, will star in the three-part series Jamie Genevieve: Great Indoors on BBC Scotland onThursday at . pm.It comes after the success of her first documentary for the networks BBC Scotland channel Jamie Genevieve #Unfiltered.The former Cathkin High School pupil started out working in make-up counters in Debenhams in Glasgow.Now she is known for her how to make-up demonstrations on YouTube.The new mini-series focuses on how Jamie and husband Jack is coping in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic from trying her hand at hairdressing to baking."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"Here we look at some of the businesses who will no longer be operating in the city and the ones under threat.Remnant KingsCity location: Howard StreetA total of  stafflost their jobs from the firmrsquos bases in Glasgow, Hamilton, and Edinburgh after the administrators were called in.The firm, which started in Glasgow in , said that although they were historically profitable, they have since suffered from declining turnover and trading dficulties in recent years caused by changing consumer habits.:Glasgow firm Remnant Kings goes into admistration resulting in job lossesOasis and Warehouse GroupCity locations past and present: Buchanan Galleries, Silverburn, Princes Square, and Glasgow Fort.The company behind Oasis and Warehouse went into administration in April when Deloitte was appointed as administrator.All stores haveclosed indefinitely whileonline sales have stopped.Reports say the fashion brands have been sold to restructuring business Hilco in a deal which includes stock but not the  stores or  concessions.Hash Ladha, chief executive of Oasis Warehouse, previouslysaid: ldquoThis is a situation that none of us could have predicted a month ago, and comes as shocking and dficult news for all of us.ldquoWe as a management team have done everything we can to try and save the iconic brands that we love.:Oasis and Warehouse who have shops in Glasgow fall into administrationCath KidstonCity location: Gordon StreetCath Kidston said they will not reopen their shops when lockdown ends.They called in the administrators in April with the closure of shops costing around  jobs.It is understood that the owner of the retro fashion brand has secured a deal to buy back the brand and its online operation.

Yoursquod scarcely know that there has been any lting of lockdown. One neighbour says her grandmother scoffs at the idea that the coronavirus crisis is like the last war, when she was a child in a nearby town. Although they were often hungry, they had complete freedom. Even when the air raid siren went, and they had to e into shelters, they did not feel the all-pervasive threat of today.Nor, unless they were extremely remote or unlucky, were people shut off from each other. We talk a lot about the power of modern technology to keep us connected, but in those times, whether you were in a village or a city, there was daily contact with other folk, evenyou lived alone. People wouldnrsquot have felt the need for video calls when they could nip out of theirdoor and visit whoever they liked nearby. The Blitz spirit is not entirely a myth, but the circumstances in which it thrived were very dferent from this pandemic.My mother lived in London and, in , like countless city children, was evacuated to the country. She was luckier than many, being sent not to strangers but to an aunt, who lived in Herefordshire, near the Welsh border. There was no running water, light was by paraffin lamp, her uncle was an irascible war veteran, and her aunt would often retreat to bed for days, finding the extra responsibility rather too much. But for an -year-old, collecting eggs from under hens, sauntering up the lane for still-warm jugs of milk from the farm, and seeing a night-time sky lit by stars was a revelation. From then on, she counted the days until she could leave London forever.Not all evacuees felt the same way. Encountering beetles and bugs for the first time was hard enough, but herds of cows with a bull among them must have been pretty alarming. One boy, who had never previously left the Gallowgate, ran to tell the farmer that ldquothey coos are eating arsquo your grass. Another Glaswegian, taken into a Perthshire home, escaped onto the roof when they ran him a bath. He thought they were trying to drown him.Recalling that period, my mother spoke of country folksrsquo shock at the poverty of inner city children, who had come from slums. Those who organised the mass evacuation were appalled to discover that, when asked to provide each child with a change of clothing, a toothbrush and enough food for a dayrsquos journey, a lot of families were unable to do so. It was a sobering eye-opener. Rural hardship was re, but it did not compare to the scale of urban deprivation: barefoot youngsters with rickets, scurvy, ringworm, or so underfed they were the colour of lard.Itrsquos hard to imagine what it must have felt like to be dropped into a world of fields and trees and pitch black nights, when you were used to well-lit canyons of concrete and stone or to find yourself alone in a bed, when usually therersquod be siblings on all sides, keeping you warm, and your parents only a step away. Some children were so miserable, they had to be sent home. For others, like my mother, it sparked a lelong love of the countryside.Not that she idealised her auntrsquos way of le. Some aspects of it were, for a Londoner, like stepping back in time. Nor, in the s, was there any glamorising of country le. It was often equated with backward attitudes and ignorance. If anything, most villagers dreamed of escaping to the city, or at least the suburbs, and a clean, warm house with all mod-cons.Irsquove been reading Dirk Bogardersquos memoir, Great Meadow, in which he recalls his childhood in the Sussex Downs, from the age of six. Between  and , he spent weekends and long spells of holiday in what his affluent parents called a cottage, but photos show as a substantial house. Later he was packed off to Glasgow, which he loathed, but thatrsquos another story. In Great Meadow, he and his little sister were looked after by a nanny, while his actress mother swanned around in a kimono, and his father raced up and down to London where he was on The Timesrsquos picture desk. Bogarde often mentions the healthiness of the country, compared to London, where public transport was frowned on, because of the risk of germs. This was a legacy, perhaps, of the Spanish flu.Bogarde loved everything about the cottage, but the most noteworthy feature was the outside lavatory. Every Friday he had to dig a hole in the garden and, under cover of dusk, empty the privy bucket into it. His great fear was of tripping, because sanitation was basic. Theyrsquod have a weekly bath, filled by their nanny, but his parents preferred going to the nearest pub for their ablutions.Years ago I visited friends in rural Perthshire who had an outside toilet. I rather liked it: it was made of wood, and smelled of sawdust. Unlike the shed at the bottom of many cottage gardens, one wall was open, so the view was lovely, even in the snow. You didnrsquot have to crunch over snails in the dark to reach it ndash bedrooms came with chamberpots ndash and as a guest there was no fear of ever being asked to empty it. To watch him on screen, yoursquod never think Bogarde was the man to cope with such a noisome task. If for any reason it suddenly becomes a necessary chore in our cottage, Irsquoll be with the Gallowgate evacuees, heading straight back to the flushing loos of the Merchant City.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The Government is rudderless, drting making contradictory decisions or no decisions at all.Boris Johnson had nothing sensible to say about the Black Lives Matter demos which drove a coach and horses through the lockdown. He could either have endorsed the protests as legitimate on moral grounds, or called on the police to enforce the law. He did neither until forced to.

The two-metre rule is causing massive problems as the economy tanks, yet the medical evidence for its effectiveness is contradictory.But the most serious accusation made last week against Boris Johnson was that he was asleep at the wheel in early March, and that his dilatory behaviour led to the deaths of tens of thousands of people.The claim was made by the former SAGE member, Professor Neil Ferguson .ldquoHad we introduced lockdown a week earlier, the Imperial College epidemiologist told MPs last week, ldquowersquod have reduced the final death toll by at least half.In other words,the UK Government had closed the schools and shops on March  instead of March , the official death toll might have been , instead of ,. This retrospectively validates Fergusonrsquos own forecast back in March that, on his model, lockdown should have kept the death toll to around ,.I think most now accept that the UK did just about everything wrong in its response to Covid-. We didnrsquot close the borders, didnrsquot protect care homes, abandoned testing and locked down too late. The question is: who is to blame for all this The editor of The Lancet, Richard Horton, in ldquoThe Covid Catastrophe which is to be published this week, names the guilty man: Boris Johnson. He failed to attend crucial meetings of COBRA, the Cabinet crisis committee, failed to listen to scientists, and thought the country should ldquotake it on the chin in order to protect the economy.But it was not just the PM who delayed lockdown by one week. This was also the policy of the Scottish Government.I happened to be in the Scottish parliament on March , the day that Leo Varadkar announced the closure of schools and universities in Ireland. At First Ministerrsquos Questions, Nicola Sturgeon explained why she was not following suit. She was, she insisted, ldquofollowing the science.School children sent home were likely to take the disease into their communities and to older people, ldquowhich might be a greater risk in terms of spread of infection than their being in school. She also said that parents would have to stay at home to look after them and this would denude staff for essential services like the NHS.:London Protests: More than  arrested as Boris Johnson condemns far-right protests as lsquoracist thuggeryrsquoIt all seemed sensible at the time. The national clinical director, Jason Leitch, was all over the media saying that the vast majority of us were going to get the virus anyway, because there was no vaccine, and that we had to ldquoprotect the vulnerable as it ldquoworked its way through the population.The release of SAGE minutes two weeks ago confirms that the scientic advisers were at best cool about lockdown. They may not have been in thrall to heartless herd immunity, but they did believe that trying to suppress the virus would be counterproductive.On March , the minutes say \"SAGE was unanimous that measures seeking to completely suppress the spread of Covid- will cause a second peak.It added that it was ldquoa near certainty that countries such as China, where heavy suppression is under way, will experience a second peak once measures are relaxed.The scientic consensus was that eradication of the disease was not possible because it would spread until herd immunity ndash % of the population ndash finally burned the virus out. But Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, took a dferent view. She closed the borders immediately cases appeared and kept them closed, and imposed a severe lockdown internally and suppressed the virus until it disappeared.

However, the minutes seem to confirm that, as Professor Lawrence Freedman argued in the New Statesman, ldquothe Government was largely following SAGErsquos advice.Some have claimed that Nicola Sturgeon wanted to follow dferent advice and was overruled by Westminster. That isnrsquot the case. The First Minister was following the same scientic advice as Westminster, and made clear she did not believe lockdown was yet necessary or desirable on March .Itrsquos hard to believe that a weekrsquos delay could have led to , deaths, as many as on the first day of the Battle of the Somme. Scientists will debate this for years.Indeed, analysts in Bristol, led by the mathematical modeller Professor Simon Wood, now claim now that the disease peaked before lockdown was introduced, suggesting that SAGE was right.SAGE had always argued, as the minutes show, that the best way to contain the spread was hand washing, social distancing, and protecting the old and vulnerable. The UK Government was only persuaded of lockdown by Neil Fergusonrsquos infamous forecast, on March , that without it , would die.The one thing we have learned from coronavirus is that science is not a monolith and that scientists disagree as much as politicians.

But the two defining events of  - coronavirus and the Black Lives Matter protests -offer Glasgow the best opportunity in a generation to finally get this right and transform George Square into the vibrant civic centre Glaswegians deserve.Letrsquos start with the pandemic, which will continue to damage the economic and social pull of town and city centres. As lockdown restrictions are gradually lted we will grasp a new reality ndash fewer shops, restaurants, bars and cultural attractions than before, with those that do re-open unable to work at full capacity for now. Answers to the sort of questions around attracting people to city centres that were already stumping businesses, planners and local authorities even before coronavirus hit have become all the more pressing.Thatrsquos where a proper revamp of George Square comes in, a key step forward in boosting Glasgowrsquos economy and cultural capital in the wake of the pandemic. What should the square contain  That would be for citizens to decide, but herersquos a few quick ideas that presume an eventual end to social distancing: an ampitheatre for live music, theatre and comedy, proper seating, pop-up pods for community groups, a food and craft market, arts and exhibition space, murals, a garden and childrenrsquos play area.As for the fate of the statues, again, it would be for the people to decide whether they still have a place in this new urban realm. Not that we would want to forget our past, of course. But surely we can find new and more creative ways to confront, commemorate and celebrate it, taking in voices that were previously ignored ndash women, ethnic minorities, working class people, gay people, the disabled ndash reflecting the ersity of our city as it is now.Rather than an expensive international competition for designs ndash letrsquos learn from  ndash a three-month public consultation could be held, and a  of local architects, planners, artists, businesspeople and community groups convened to create perhaps three dferent plans, which would then be voted on by the people of Glasgow.

Surely a mixture of public, private and philanthropic funding could be sourced Glasgow City Council has already started the conversation that could make all this happen, by bringing forward the pedestrianisation of George Square and suspending a third of city centre parking bays to make room for walkers and cyclists.I would urge council leader Susan Aitken and her team to think bigger. A commitment to redesign George Square would offer an exciting, positive and inclusive focus for Glaswegians in the tough months ahead. The end result could be what Glasgow has been crying out for for a generation: a proud and modern civic centrepiece that is worthy of our great city, a place that excites, entertains, and educates, that makes us feel part of something bigger.

What changed  Whorsquos in charge David Bone, Girvan.JIM Sillarss absurd suggestion that the British state should pay reparations for the slave trade to ethnic minoritiesdisplays ignorance of both historical facts and praxis.Contrary to the myth, British slavery was not a uniquely \"black\" experience. Romanichal Gypsies along with other itinerants and \"undesirables\" were shipped from Henry VIIIs time as slaves to the colonies, some sold to freed blacks in the West Indies. On slavery few historically have clean hands.For two centuries, the Colliers and SaltersAct  made all miners de facto slaves of mine owners until released or death. More than , Britons from coastal areas were enslaved by the Barbary Corsairs over three centuries until the mid-th ndash to say nothing of the three centuries of Scandinavian and Irish Viking slave raids.In counterbalance, Britain remains the only world nation to establish a military force to destroy international slavery, the Royal Navys West Africa Squadron, which over years freed over   black slaves.The notion of black slavery reparations seems to me to be white middle-class virtue signalling at its worst.Mark Boyle, Johnstone.LIKE many people, I am sure, I have felt somewhat ambivalent at the sight of statues being toppled or public monuments being defaced as part of the anti-racist movement sweeping the world. While sharing the sentiments of those directly involved, I canrsquot help feeling that there has to be a better, less crude way of highlighting the vile past behaviour of some of our most prominent fellow countrymen. They should indeed be named and shamed but does removing a statue erected in their \"honour\" really achieve anything other than erasing them from the historical record in the most visible way As a retired teacher, I firmly believe that the educational process offers a much more fruitful and positive way ahead. Many schools recognise and honour the sacrices of our young men ndash whilst highlighting the folly of war ndash by organising regular trips to the First World War battlefields and cemeteries. Similarly, the funded programme of annual visits to Auschwitz involving groups of secondary pupils has been an extremely powerful way of ensuring that one of the most horric episodes in human history is never forgotten.With respect to slavery, in the absence of a suitable \"location\" to visit, a dferent approach could be adopted. All of our major cities ndash particularly those that benefited the most from the slave trade ndash should have a permanent exhibition charting in full detail the history of the slave trade . This would, ideally, be housed within an existing museum already benefiting from an established footfall. Pupils from all primary and secondary schools would be invited to visit on a structured, educational visit as part of a unit of work which would be a compulsory inclusion in the curriculum. In this way, all of our young people would benefit from a true and accurate account of this most nefarious period in our history. The phrase \"lest we forget\" applies equally well in this context.Rob Kelly, Bearsden.WITH the current national protests associated with the injustice of slavery and transportation of black slaves from West Africa to British colonies to harvest sugar in the plantations, it has been interesting to reflect on the Scottish connections.What is little known, however, is the inclusion of Scots, as slaves, in this period of history.In  more than  Scots were being sent to the West Indies as slaves from Edinburgh. The small ship sank in a storm off Orkney. The men had no chance as they were allowed to drown, battened below in the hold.Their crime was that they were Covenanters, unwilling to accept bishops in their Scottish Presbyterian faith, imposed by the established Episcopalian Church. Hunted down, they resorted to having church services in fields, particularly in the south of Scotland. Some were tied to stakes and allowed to drown slowly in the rising tide of the Solway Firth.My interest is that my ancestors, John and James Kirk, were two of the slaves drownedPerhaps we should accept that we cannot change history, just learn from it.John Kirk Ewing, Ayr.THE vandalising of Robert the Bruces statue at Bannockburn on the bogus grounds that he was a racist is instructive as well as disgraceful.The attack on Bruces statue when he lived  years ago and almost certainly never even saw an African person shows that this has nothing to do with racism.Instead, we have to look at the wider pattern. Statues of Churchill and Lincoln have been vandalised in London, and of Robert Dundas in Edinburgh. A bronze of Lord Baden-Powell is under guard in Poole. When even Queen Victorias statue in Leeds has been attacked, it is clear that it is sufficient to be famous, dead and white.The real objective of these attacks is to erase our cultural identity. If these acts were done by foreigners, they would be recognised as genocidal in intent.We should concede nothing to the extremists using the tragic death of George Floyd in Minneapolis as cover for attempted Maoist cultural revolution.Otto Inglis, Crossgates, Fe.OH that people would learn some history before pegging trivial debating points on wild mis-statements. Robert Bruce did not gain the Scottish crown by cold-blooded murder. His slaying of John Comyn, which is what I assume Duncan Soomanhas in mind, was recognised at the time as a killing committed in the heat of passion: a crime and a sin, of course, but a much lesser one than premeditated murder. Both church and secular laws in mediaeval times were perfectly clear about the moral and legal distinction. All recent historians concur in this interpretation of Brucersquos act.Furthermore, far from gaining him the Scottish crown, the killing made his eventual success in this even more astonishing, since it plunged him into a full-scale civil war in Scotland on top of the ongoing war with England. The fact that this was an entirely predictable consequence of Comynrsquos death is pretty conclusive proof that the killing was not premeditated.Derrick McClure, Aberdeen AB.Read more: Letters: British state should pay reparations"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June ,  at : pmOrkney Islands Councilhas said it is hoping it can start accepting more items at the re-opened recycling centres, from next week onwards.

Unsurprisingly, as time passes so businesses from across the region are increasingly seeking clarity on a wide range of issues vital to their survival.With Phase  of the unlocking process due shortly, the FSB believes that this is the perfect time for smaller businesses to question Mr Ewing on what the Scottish Government is doing to support businesses over the next year.The FSB’s Highlands  Islands Area Leader and director of the Kylesku Hotel, Tanja Lister, said: “We know how anxious businesses are becoming about their abilities to survive in this new world and, given that the virus is unpredictable, they clearly want as much clarity as possible so that they can plan their survival strategies once unlocking takes place.“In particular, they want to know when and how unlocking will take place, what they must do to comply with distancing protocols, how local communities will be persuaded that the time is right to unlock, and the nature of the Government-backed business support that will be put in place to carry the regional economy though to next Easter and beyond.“Nobody should think that businesses can go from nought to  in a few days – it will take a long time for them to recover, and many will need ongoing support from governments, public agencies, other businesses and, very importantly, the general public, for many months to come.“We know how heavily engaged Mr Ewing is in his vital role and we are delighted that he is giving up his time to take questions on Monday. This is the perfect time for him to meet Highlands  Islands businesses and we are looking forward to a very productive hour with him.”Questions must be submitted in advance and we will ask as many as we can in the allotted time, say the organisers. Participants can also submit comments during the meeting using Zoom’s ‘Chat’ .The event is free and open to all businesses.

Hundreds were accused after the Horizon system showed cash shortfalls at their branches.Speaking in the House, Mr Carmichael said: “I hope that when he s to the department today he will tell his officials and tell also the Post Office senior management that this review just isn’t going to cut it.#This is a complex case and that is why it requires a judge-led inquiry, and that is what will happen eventually, so why not just cut to the quick and do it now ”Responding for the Government, Paul Scully MP said: “The point is the terms of reference within this review are the same as a judge-led inquiry.#I do not want an inquiry that lasts  years and that sub-postmasters are going to come back time and time again with no justice. This is something that I have been pushing on from the moment that I found out the detail about it, and that is why I am going to drive this through to make sure that the answers are heard and that independent chair gets to the bottom of this and gets some answers.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The minister’s response was inadequate. Postmasters are vital parts of our communities, especially in the outer isles where they sit at the heart of island le. This scandal and the Post Office’s woeful reaction to it have undermined confidence in the treatment of our postmasters. The government must do more to repair that trust, starting with a proper judicial inquiry.“It bears repeating that local post offices have proven their essential role once again during the Covid- crisis. We have to ensure that future postmasters are not put off by this scandal.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The two metre social distancing rule will affect passenger capacity for our ferries – and we also continue to experience issues around the availability of staff and the effect that has on opportunities around timetabling.“I would assure our isles residents that we continue to bring these issues and challenges to the attention of the Scottish Government and will do all we can to maximise sailingsnecessary, taking on board the views of our isles residents throughout.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orwe the providers are the birds, desperately hoping for an income, fat and seed to feed us after an extra-long winter.Social media fluttered with posts from businesses stating ‘we hope to be open’, the sensible ones being aware of Fergus Ewing’s proviso: “This date cannot be definitive and is conditional on public health advice and progression to phase three of the route map.”While a lot of work will need to be done, practicalities and protocols worked out, how do we clean rooms, how do we ‘meet and greet’, do we leave rooms fallow for  hours, do we use PPE when cleaning, I think as much work needs to be done in the wider community.How are the visitors going to eat, how are they going to shop I have seen some quite lax adherence to protection in local shops with face covering usage fairly minimal at best.We have probably got away with this behaviour due to the low numbers of cases outwith the care home community.This could change with an influx of people from away. Any vigilantism must be directed at ourselves and the messages we put out when we go about our day to day business as lockdown eases.Protect ourselves and others.Those vulnerable people we have been looking after with prescription runs and message collections, some of them might not be looking forward to an influx of staycationers.What  are they bringing with their much-needed cash None of these problems are insurmountable. Guidelines will be available and in the month ahead, confidence will hopefullyand a dose of common sense will go a long way to making things work.The talk is that furlough is just the precursor to redundancy, and the economy will be struggling in all sectors.The knock on is likely to be fewer visitors with less money, and of course with the quarantine enforcement for overseas visitors, there won’t be many coming from afar.I hope the tourismwill be a trickle, then a stream, in order for us all to get used to how it can work.Despite being involved in the business I actually hope that it never s to the flood, the tsunami of the last two years, where the danger was the destruction of our environment and our community.We were perhaps too busy making money to spend time with our families, friends and neighbours.While loving the quiet roads, the time spent with family, and the time spent re-evaluating prioritiesit couldn’t last for ever.The savings are being eaten into, the government assistance also doesn’t last forever, reality looms.There is an economic model of price and product determination, that everybody is acutely aware of called “supply and demand’.In recent years as the visitor numbers went through the roof, and perhaps became unsustainable, bed provision rose, spare rooms developed, cabins and pods built, garages renovated.Still numbers rose, and so did the prices, a simple correlation.There is likely to now be an oversupply of bed provision, the economists would foresee a reduction in price as people compete for a smaller market.This may at first bring prices down to a realistic level, there was perhaps a danger that Skye was becoming a rich person’s destination.A possible consequence may be what I have heard described as “a race to the bottom”, with what is effectively a price war, and possibly falling too far.This when the product suddenly has become more expensive to manage, rooms costing more to clean, hotels only being able to cope with fewer guests to comply with social distancing.We have a free market economy, there is little or no control, people can charge what they like, and undercutting is a valid entrepreneurial technique do something better cheaper#!I mentioned weeks ago, for many, the tourist dollar is the icing on the pension cake, a second income to a professional wage.Perhaps there is a fine line between need and greed.Some tourist operators have been forced to use food banks and needing help from the Skye Community Response group during lockdown.As business s, and these people can begin rebuilding their livelihoods, perhaps others have to decide what their own needs are.The pension or the wage might be enough.One of the reasons I love starlings is the incredible murmurations they create in autumn, just before roosting in the evenings.These bickering birds who flutter and jostle around the trees, for twenty minutes or so before descending to reeds and branch to sleep, put on a display with no equal in nature.Moving in unison, they create patterns in the sky, shapes, forms, dance. Apparently, each bird affects the six or seven around it but a flock of tens of thousands moves asone, producing something beautul.Community can be like that.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KC-Photo.jpg","title":"delight as kyleakin connections project to take ownership of its","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe project has been successful with its application to the Scottish Land Fund and has been awarded £, to buy the Old School in Kyleakin.Kyleakin Connections, a charity formerly known as Skye and Lochalsh Association for Disability, has been using the building for nearly  years as a day resource for adults with learning disabilities.This funding will allow Kyleakin Connections to buy the premises from Highland Council.The present services will continue to be delivered from the premises, including a range of activities which focus on increasing the independent living skills of the attenders, encouraging health and wellbeing and interacting with the wider community.The Nice Café and Bookshop, operated by the attenders one day per week, has proved to be a popular enterprise.The Old School is currently also being used by a number of local groups as a complement to the larger community hall.The purchase of the building will open up other possibilities and plans are in progress to expand and develop the facilities to meet the present and future needs of groups, especially the more vulnerable, within South Skye and Lochalsh.Dr Audrey Sinclair, Chairperson of Kyleakin Connections Board said: “We are delighted with the news.#Not only will it allow us to carry on our normal services, we shall be able to expand our activities and extend the usage of the building to other groups in the community.#Kyleakin Connections has been fortunate for many years to have a loyal group of members and friends and we are grateful for their support and encouragement with this project.#I would also like to acknowledge the Highland Council, the present owners of the Old School, for their positive response to our request to purchase the premises.#At a time of so much uncertainty and sad news during this Covid- crisis, it is refreshing to be able to bring some good news into the community and give everyone something to look forward to.#We are especially looking forward to when we can hold an event to celebrate the acquisition of the premises.”Local Councillor John Finlayson said: “I am delighted to have been involved in the discussions about the purchase of the building and I also welcome the positive relationships that have been further established between the Highland Council and the Board of Kyleakin Connections, to further develop the exciting future of this important and community-based group who deliver such a key service.#As someone who lives in the village of Kyleakin, I know how important Kyleakin Connections is to both the users and the local community.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3168596.jpg--.jpg?1591792177000\n","title":"low emission funds welcomed by wrightbus","story":"Following this mornings announcement by Northern Irelands Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon pledging poundm for low emission buses, Ballymena-based bus manufacturer Wrightbus has said it is delighted with the commitment to invest in a green recovery.

While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication. If a customer is concerned about the identity of a caller to their home they can call the PSNI ‘Quick Check’ service on .

To see it on a big screen will be great, said Nicky . It#s really strange that we haven#t been able to get to the cinema in so long. So, it is nice to just get out to do something dferent is a novelty now.Waiting patiently for the film to get under way, the Co Antrim pair praised the smooth running of the event, which was organised by local firms Red Box Media Productions and MayWe, a Belfast-based event management company.Cars were positioned two metres apart in line with social distancing guidelines and the field was lined with portable toilets for convenience, each one monitored by stewards and cleaned after every use.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseReporter Jenna Gardiner FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappReporter Jenna GardinerEven as soon as we pulled in we were impressed, it#s been very well organised, Nicky said. I couldn#t believe how clean the toilets were, especially for an outdoor event.The view is cracker with the screen positioned just in front of the Harland  Wolff cranes, added Michelle . The setting is just lovely.The couple say they are keen toto the drive-in cinema should it continue when the rest of normal le resumes.Compared with those distant memories of my pre-Covid cinema trips, watching from the car was a convenient experience.While drive-in cinemas are a relatively new attraction to Northern Ireland, borne out of the pandemic, I was struck by how nostalgic an experience it was to join hundreds of others to spectate from the car.Perhaps that#s down to the fact I#ve only ever seen it done in Grease, or due to the now-dated special effects of the film, but the whole ritual certainly felt like a blast from the past.One new novelty of the experience was the lack of distractions, with no coughing or sneezing, people using their phones or pesky whispers to contend with.Accessed by radio, we controlled the sound and volume ourselves and could recline our seats as far as we liked.Another plus for the spectators is that by attending the screening they were also helping in the fight against coronavirus, with all profits going towards vital research at Queen#s University Belfast.Without any indication of adate for conventional cinemas in Northern Ireland, the drive-in event offers a new prospect for movie buffs across the country.Around , cars attended throughout the day for four dferent classic movies, including The Lion King, Frozen  and Back To The Future, with an additional three films shown on Saturday.Certainly a fun way to spend an afternoon, the event kicked off with an interactive quiz to test our knowledge of The Goonies before the film started. Afterwards, it ended with a round of applause - or rather, a honking of horns - as the credits rolled on the Steven Spielberg classic.

Travellers came, one by one, every few minutes.An early morning flight to Liverpool already away from the terminal, Bristol was the next destination, but waiting outside the main entrance as an airport shuttle bus pulled up, there was no-one getting off.Digital advertising screens showcase Northern Ireland to no visitors yet. Throw something in one of the bins along the front of the terminal and you will break the cobwebs that have gathered.Lying idle, the engines in the easyJet livery have been burning up to £m a day.And while the financial side of things will be important to the company, it is the inidual stories of people desperate to travel again that help hit home what we have been missing.Linda Henry from Lisburn was dropping off her daughter Philippa Haire, taking her chance to get back to Plymouth where she is at university.But while attendance at educational institutions may have ceased, there has been a more pressing need for Philippa to travel. I have to get back this week, she said. I have a part-time job which I need to keep to help pay for university le. My furlough from that has ended.But this is all very surreal. There#s no-one around.Despite the lack of passengers arriving, her face mask goes on.From what we know there#s no specic social distancing measures for the flight as long as you#re wearing a mask, said mum Linda. It#s the only flight to Bristol so she had to take it.Also arriving, Allan and Jenny Kuhn, from Belfast, are off to visit their daughter Lucy, who lives in Sidmouth along the Devon coastline. For them the chance to fly again is a great relief.Our daughter hasn#t been well and needs our help, said Allan. This is the first chance we#ve had to get over to visit her and lend a hand. But we#re comfortable. Northern Ireland seems to have the virus well under control. The airport is ready to deal with passengers and we#ve waited a long time to be able to do this.I know you can#t see under the face mask, but we#re both smiling today.Later in the afternoon, theflight from Bristol lands and again there are tales of lives resuming.For Claire Brown there was the chance to finally find her new family home in Northern Ireland.We#ve been living in Devon but we#re moving back here, she said, arriving with her husband and daughter. Once estate agents reopened, our house sold very quickly and now we have to find somewhere to live here. It feels great to finally be on the move. The flight was comfortable, no issues, plenty of announcements. It was all very smooth.Karen Jones landed to see parents Jim and Maureen Hunter from Coleraine for the first time since Christmas. It was all very well done, she said, finally removing a face mask after arriving from her home in Bath. It was a good time to travel, plenty of space on board and enough empty seats so we could all stay well apart.The big challenge will come as more people begin travelling again in an industry under no illusions that there is still a tough task ahead to recover.For now Graham Keddie, managing director at Belfast International Airport, said he was delighted to finally be opening the doors to passenger flights. We have been working hard behind the scenes to prepare the terminal and implement new hygiene and safety measures for the health and wellbeing of all passengers and staff, he explained.Today we should have ,-plus going through the terminal and we should be lucky to have  or , he said, and he still has no idea how quarantine measures will be enforced.The majority of easyJet#s flights in June will be on domestic routes, flying around % of its Belfast routes in July and % in August, although with fewer flights.

The updated shielding guidance applies until June  and Dr McBride has said further guidance will be provided before the end of the month.Officials are facing calls to provide clarity to people who are shielding, particularly amid reports that some people are coming under pressure toto work, while concerns have also been raised by younger people who are shielding about the effects the protection measures are having on their children.DUP MLA Alex Easton, a member of the Stormont health committee, said any further letters advising people to shield must include more information for patients and employers.I would like more clarity around shielding in general, he said. My father, who is diabetic and has lost both legs as a result, didn#t receive a letter, so I think that the letters need to include a lot more information.I would like to see the letters include a booklet with a list of conditions and medication that mean patients should shield. There should also be specic information for employers because I have been contacted by people who have been told to shield and they are being expected to work.I think the majority of employers have been very understanding, but the longer this goes on, the more challenging it is going to be for those who are shielding. The next letter should include detailed information for employers about why it is so important that anyone who is shielding should take the precautions that is being sent out by the CMO.People who have been deemed as falling to the highest clinical risk group, and have therefore been told to shield, include anyone who has had an organ transplant, cancer patients, people with motor neurone disease and anyone with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.In the letters being sent out to people this week, Dr McBride explained: I know that this has been a very challenging time for you and that it will not always have been easy to comply with the advice. The Covid- virus still poses a high risksomeone who is shielding is exposed to it. However, infection levels in the community are now falling so the risk of exposure is signicantly less than it has been over the last two months.Because the risk is lower, I have now updated the guidance for Northern Ireland so that from June  those who are shielding can now spend time outside with people from their own household or one person from another household whilst ensuring that social distancing is observed. I know that you will want to know about our plans for the future of the shielding advice. Please be assured that we are actively reviewing the shielding advice and we will provide new guidance before the end of the first shielding period.Dr McBride is also asking anyone who is shielding to take part in an engagement process which will help advise government policy on shielding in the months ahead.He added: Finally, I wanted to thank you for all of your efforts during this very dficult time. The Covid- pandemic has made huge demands on many people across Northern Ireland, and I want you to know that we understand the uncertainty and upheaval that those shielding, their families and carers in particular have faced.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Pubs, restaurants and hotels to reopen in early July as no new deaths confirmedBelfast Thai restaurant to close as downturn in trade takes its tollStatues of King Billy and Sir Hans Sloane targeted over links to slaveryTributes to motocross fan Brendan Graham, discovered dead at Desertmartin trackNorthern Ireland town hall funded by slave trader #should be renamed#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Travellers are feeling the impact, but sotoo are pilots and flight attendants. #It#s hard after  years to write up my CV and think where it leads to outside aviation#Former Flybe pilot Nigel Best , from Ballymena, has worked for the airline for  years and transferred from his role as an engineer to become a pilot six years ago. He is married with two children and a grandson. He worked in Michelin as an apprentice after leaving school and then became an apprentice engineer in the RAF.I served for  years with the RAF and then joined Jersey European as a CAA licensed engineer. I did that for  years, but I always had my pilot#s licence and I built upon that and became a flight instructor, he says.Nigel says initial flight training costs £,: It#s a big investment. When you are a pilot it#s not just like you get a licence like a driving licence. Every six months you#ve got to do a simulator test and there are always tests and evaluations. My licence now will only last for a year and I will have to renew it at my own expense.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNigel Best  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNigel Best On his days off he also worked at Woodgate Aviation for the Air Ambulance on a voluntary basis.After six years as a pilot his last flight was on March , bringing passengers from Manchester into Belfast.I know everybody puts so much effort into their job, but everybody within Flybe, from the cabin crew and engineer to the pilots, worked so hard. It was also a very family-oriented business. Everybody knew each other and everybody was there for each other. People had worked there for  years or more and they loved serving the people of Northern Ireland, he says.Since lockdown, Nigel has been doing DIY projects using his engineering skills, and has been looking for work.I#ll probably go back to engineering, there#s more likelihood of me getting an engineer#s job in Northern Ireland, he adds.He says the highlight of his career was when he flew his family on a scheduled flight to London City Airport for his we#s grandmother#s th birthday, fulfilling her letime ambition of visiting the Cha Flower Show.He also loved sharing his knowledge as an engineer with first officers working alongside him in the cockpit.To me it was just the sheer fact that I never went to sleep at night dreading that I had to go to work the next morning.The worst aspect was always the threat of redundancy. Aviation is always the first industry that reacts quickly to a downturn and an upturn. Because of the cost in aviation you have to act very quickly and those who react the quickest are the ones who survive.It#s hard after  years to write up my CV, look at all the experience in my background and think where this leads to outside aviation.Nigel believes that Flybe employees lost their jobs as a result of Covid- because Virgin Atlantic, which had bought over the business, decided to focus on its own brand.Flybe was connecting people, families, businesses within the British Isles and that has now been lost, he adds.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePhilip Land with his late father Paul FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPhilip Land with his late father Paul‘I would cut my arm off to get a job in the industry again... it was an amazing experience but things will be dferent’Philip Land , from Lisburn, was a flight attendant for Flybe until the airline went into administration just before lockdown. He is married to Karl. Following a career in hospitality, Philip was working at a catering company in Belfast City Airport when he was encouraged to apply for a cabin crew position by crew stopping for lunch.“I’d always wanted to be a cabin crew, but because of my age and height, I didn’t think I would be suitable,” he says.“But I went to the assessment day and passed — that was three years ago and I was a cabin crew member from March that year. It’s been the most brilliant time.”Philip describes Flybe’s employees as being like a family. “My best day was the first day I flew on what is called ‘fam day’, short for familiarisation, when I had to fly home in the jump seat, the third seat in the cockpit, for the whole of the flight from Southampton to Belfast and that was absolutely amazing — it’s not something that you normally get to do, to see what the captain and the pilots do.“You get to see the take-off and the landing and you’re watching the ground coming closer and closer — it’s absolutely amazing.”Philip, a rep for Unite the Union, was on a health and safety course in Carlisle when he learned that Flybe had closed down.“I spent all night talking to members on the phone — they were like brothers and sisters and uncles and aunts. It had to be the worst day of my le, the loss of that job,” he says.“I never realised until it was coming to an end how much it takes over your le. I loved going to work.“The company went into administration on March  and the following week, the country started to go into lockdown. We were dealing with our members, trying to get them sorted, updating their CVs and making sure all monies were arranged. We had a two-week period of manic activity, trying to get people organised, and all of a sudden it was locked down and you couldn’t do it anymore.”After going into lockdown, Philip fell ill and was in self-isolation for nearly four weeks.“I had every symptom, other than the cough — a sore chest, my body was so sore, I couldn’t even get out of bed most days. I don’t know whether it was the mental exhaustion after two weeks of living on adrenaline rushes. Karl had a cough, but nothing untoward, but he wasn’t right — we both definitely weren’t right.“I’ve had many, many bad colds when I was flying — you pick up anything that is going around — but that had to be the worst. “Six of us that had been in the same group all had symptoms and we all feel we had some form of coronavirus, but you can’t get tested as you are just a number to this government.”After recovering, Philip has spent the time in lockdown painting and decorating and taken part in weekly Zoom quizzes with friends, but has barely left the house.“My father, Paul Land, was a Cha pensioner in London and he got Covid and died on April . My brother had to arrange a virtual cremation for him,” he says.“Things have been hard. I am a mental health first-aider, which has been a lesaver for me, because there are times when you just think... why ”Philip says that unless Flybe s or is replaced with a small regional airline, he can’t see himself being able to work in the airline industry again.“My concern is that there is so little connectivity now with the mainland from Belfast. We don’t have the bridge Boris Johnson is talking about, we don’t have a tunnel to get across. WI’d cut my arm off to get a job in the industry again. It was an amazing experience, but it’s going to take time for it to settle down and how are they going to work with self-distancing “If they’re doing a deep clean for each flight, that’s at least an hour. Things are going to be very dferent.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseCaoimhe Leigh Harkin has been in lockdown in Dubai since March, having become an Emirates cabin crew employee last year FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCaoimhe Leigh Harkin has been in lockdown in Dubai since March, having become an Emirates cabin crew employee last year‘If it takes two years for things to go back to normal, my contract will be over...but I may go home to my family’Caoimhe Leigh Harkin , from Co Tyrone, has been a flight attendant with Emirates since last March and has been in lockdown in Dubai. She originally graduated in journalism in  before working as a travel journalist in Dublin, but was keen to travel before settling down. She was hired by Emirates in February last year after attending an open day.“Before all of this, the job has been wonderful. I have loved the travel and the whole experience,” she says.“I’ve been to Australia, Italy, South Africa, and I’ve done some amazing things. I’ve been to Bali, Mauritius — I’ve been to places I would probably never have been toI hadn’t taken the job. I thought, ‘If I don’t do this now, I’ll never do it’.“With Emirates, every day is so dferent. You have  days off a month in Dubai and you do seven or eight flights, some of which are layovers, or they could be turnaround flights, where you leave Dubai that day and come back that night.“It’s been the best year of my le — there’s literally no words to describe it. The hardest thing is jet lag and being sleep deprived — you just sleep when you can. But when you’re going into a layover for  hours when it’s somewhere you’ve never been before, you just have to go and see that place and do without the sleep.”Caoimhe lives in an Emirates-owned accommodation tower along with many other crew members.“We’ve made a wee family out here — me and my best friends live in the towers beside each other. Every day is dferent, there’s something always going on in Dubai.”At the start of the pandemic, the city was in -hour lockdown with tighter restrictions than in the UK, she says.“We needed a permit even to get groceries and you only got the permit once every three days. You had to input your UEA identication andyou went before your three days was up, you got declined.

They literally have drones going round the streets sterilising them —only everywhere could do it the way Dubai does it,” Caoimhe says.Her last flight was on March  and she has been in lockdown ever since, and found it hard to adjust to a less active lestyle.But with the relaxation in lockdown, she was able to book a hotel in the city and stay there for five nights with some friends.“It has a suite with a private pool and the views are amazing over the skyline of Dubai,” Caominhe says.“We have our own rooms, but we’re able to spend time together, which is nice. The hotel is only for residents of Dubai. We have to be in by pm and can’t leave the hotel until am, and we’re still sticking to the guidelines because we’re not in one room. The past five days have been really nice, but it’s back to reality tomorrow.”Caominhe says Emirates is bringing staff back in phases.“There’s a lot of negativity in the news about other airlines, but Emirates don’t have that at all... they’re making people stay on top of their safety procedures before we get started back.“We’re on standby and you have to be preparedyou’re called for a flight. If you’re called to do a flight, you have to quarantine for  days afterwards.”But she says she’s not sure what to do in the long term. Her contract lasts for three years and Caoimhe wasn’t intending to do a second contract afterwards.“If it takes two years for things to go back to normal, my contract will be over and I didn’t plan to stay longer. I’m trying to be smart about it, but my decision may be going back and spending time with my family — maybe it’s a sign,” she says.

File image posed by modelJohn BreslinJune   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailClose to £m was spent on take-home alcohol from supermarkets and grocery stores in Northern Ireland in a -week period just before and during lockdown.While overall consumption is believed to have dropped considerably with the closure of bars, the amount bought in the stores, excluding spirits, jumped % compared to the same period last year, according to an international consulting firm.The figures can be revealed as public health officials encourage people to take a closer look at their drinking habits at home to mark Northern Ireland Alcohol Awareness Week.And it comes as the Executive announced the phased reopening of bars from July , but only inside where substantial food is served and table service outside.Many of us enjoy a drink, but we need to remember that alcohol is a powerful drug that can seriously damage your health, and also have a negative impact on those around you, said Michael Owen, regional lead for drugs and alcohol at the Public Health Agency.It#s particularly important at this time, as people are drinking at home, to pause and think about how much you drink.Kantar World, which tracks supermarket and other store sales, said the previously unpublished figures for Northern Ireland represent alcohol purchased in grocery stores to be consumed at home. Those numbers do not include independent off-licences and there are no readily available, or regularly published, figures available for total sales of alcohol in Northern Ireland, either take-home or at the bar, or both.According to Kantar, Northern Ireland people bought £m worth of beer, lager, cider and wine from grocery stores in the  weeks to May , up from just over £m during the same period last year.Households bought  million litres of alcohol, an increase from  million litres, or %.The  weeks includes a period when the bars were still open.The numbers to a large degree tally with more comprehensive surveys in the Republic.Nin reported that off-sales increased year on year by % in the four weeks to May , to a total of €m .Based on those figures, off-sales in Northern Ireland are likely running at approximately £m every four weeks during lockdown, including spirits and from off licences.According to Nin, around  million litres of alcohol was sold overall in the Republic during the four weeks, a decrease of  million litres from the same period last year. The PHA and Northern Ireland#s five Drug and Alcohol Coordination Teamsare asking people to check how much they are drinking at home during the shut down.The Alcohol MOT tool offers the opportunity to learn more about the number of units you are drinking and highlights whether or not you are putting yourself at risk, and directs you to advice on reducing your alcohol intake, Mr Owen said, adding that % of adults in Northern Ireland drink alcohol.He added: In a pub or restaurant it can be easier to keep track of how much we#re drinking as accurate measures are used, but with these businesses currently closed, people are more likely to #free pour# at home and fill the glass a bit more than we might get from a measure when we#re out, so the number of units is greater than we think.Think about how much you are pouring and try your best to measure out your alcohol, enabling you to keep better track of your units.It#s also very important to have several alcohol-free days during the week. Plan these out, too, so you can keep check on them.Remember, being intoxicated could be putting you and others at risk, as your judgment will be impaired and you may not be able to follow the social distancing and hygiene practices that are required to help protect you from coronavirus.Drinkers can take the test at www.drugsandalcoholni.info mot  Belfast   Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Pubs, restaurants and hotels to reopen in early July as no new deaths confirmedBelfast Thai restaurant to close as downturn in trade takes its tollStatues of King Billy and Sir Hans Sloane targeted over links to slaveryTributes to motocross fan Brendan Graham, discovered dead at Desertmartin trackNorthern Ireland town hall funded by slave trader #should be renamed#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It must remain below one to avoid exponential growth.The briefing paper states that modelling suggests that R remains signicantly below  at present.

This will depend on public compliance with any restrictions, policy decisions and other factors such as the behaviour of the virus and the development of effective treatments or a vaccine.Health officials have used modelling to show what would happen#R# rose to ., . or . from June , and measures to suppress the epidemic were not taken or were ineffective. The modelling extends to the end of .It states:If #R# rose to ., the epidemic would peak in early October with close to  patients requiring ICU support in early October. Under this scenario, modelling suggests four-week restrictions may need to be put in place in mid-August, late October and then February .If #R# rose to ., the epidemic would peak in early December, with over  patients requiring ICU support.The paper notes that in either scenario deaths would be much greater than in wave one of the epidemic.If #R# rose to ., the epidemic would still be increasing at the end of  and over  patients would be in critical care.Mr Swann praised society#s herculean efforts to stem the virus, but warned complacency remains the biggest enemy in the continuing battle against Covid-.It is impossible to stress enough that this terrible disease, which has already claimed the lives of so many of our loved ones, has not gone away, he said.It remains ready to strike again, perhaps with even greater ferocity than before.We only have to look at the modelling, which was released recently by my department, to see that as we emerge from this phase of the pandemic, we most do so with caution and an appreciation that the war is far from won.Previous modelling at the outset of the pandemic predicted , deaths in what Mr Swann described as a nightmare, worst case scenario.

His younger years coincided with a bright spell in the clubs history. He spoke to Michael McMullan about losing championships, winning the John McLaughlin Cup and building for the future. Gutty McGlone is no dferent to any other competitor. Defeat hits him like a sledgehammer. It festers to the very pit of his stomach. Its county final afternoon in  and an emerging Lavey team savour the sweet aroma of victory. Inside, in the corner of the Glen dressing room, McGlone reflects. The remnants of their - to - defeat get tossed through his mind again, something only disappointment can do. googletag.cmd.push The pitter patter of water in the adjoining shower area stops. The noise you only hear above the eerie silence of failure. John McErlain, Liam Devlin and Damian Barton emerge. Their confab draws a common conclusion. They had left three titles behind them. Next year will be dferent. In , -year-old McGlones debut season, the Bridge didnt stand up for themselves in the championship against Ballinderry, before losing the game. Eamonn Coleman was manager and after making him a regular from the mid-point of the league, Hugh wasnt selected for the championship defeat to the Shamrocks, with Coleman later confessing it was about protecting him for a career ahead. He just wasnt ready. googletag.cmd.push Three years earlier, torn ligaments in McGlones right ankle, sustained in school action for St Pius, worked out for the best. “Before that, I couldnt kick with my weak foot,” recalls Hugh, who would later coach at underage and engineer the foundations for the current senior team. He remembers the late Brendan Convery insisting on ato school training once he could walk, before arming him with a bag of balls. “Convery made me stand on the and kick every ball into the goals with my left foot. The next week, he made me go to the ,” McGlone clearly remembers. The man who managed Laveys All-Ireland winning team was developing McGlone without him even knowing. “I gradually got stronger and stronger and thats where I ended up playing at left corner back for the Bridge seniors at , because I had two feet and was able to go up the line...that was all down to Brendan Convery.” St Pius annexed an U Vocational Schools All-Ireland, with McGlone on board. A year later, in , Derry minors, who played most of the game with  men following the first-minute dismissal of Gregory McCloskey, were beaten by a point in Newry by Down, who went on to win the All-Ireland. McGlone lined out at corner back and a year more experienced, had established himself as a regular on the Bridge senior team. Once again, they crossed paths with Ballinderry. After having previously taken two games to beat Magherafelt, they met the Shamrocks in the infamous semi-final replay encounter at Greenlough. Newbridge came through to play Dungiven in a final.  The Newbridge team pictured before the  Derry senior final It wasnt to be. Newbridge were going to stand their ground this time. Familiarity bred contempt and after another tempestuous battle with the Shamrocks, which saw pitch invasions, Newbridge were thrown out leaving Dungiven to be awarded the title in the boardroom. Losing was becoming a habit and in the aftermath of their  defeat, before leaving Glen, they made a pact. “We are going to learn from this,” McGlone relays of the collective dressing room message. “We left one , we didnt get playing in oneand now we have lost one. We are not going to lose another one.” *** You earned your corn at Newbridge training. The championship jersey wasnt handed out willy nilly. Gutty McGlone, the youngest of seven boys in a house of  children, would leave home for the short walk to the hall for a Saturday pre-championship meeting before the  final. He was unnecessarily uneasy. “Im not sure of my position here,” McGlone thought. He was ever-present and never substituted during the year, but Stephen Walls, an All-Ireland minor winner with Derry in , was breathing down McGlones neck. “Thats the class of player we had on the bench. I knew I had played well, but because of the competition at the time in the Newbridge team, I was thinking I could get a gunk here I knew the pressure was on, thats why you had to perform.” It was an era that secured back-to-back senior leagues in  and , as well as three reserve championships inside five years. “This just wasnt about the senior team, those three teams were the pinnacle of us winning thechampionship in ,” McGlone stated, in no uncertain terms. Before emphasising it again. “We played games at training during ...it was a senior team against a reserve team. We struggled to beat them, so that shows you the class of talent we had in Newbridge at that time.” McGlone name-checks Mickey McGrogan and Shane Doherty as some of the forwards who trotted into his left corner back area in training games, players not even listed on the -man match-day  for the final. And they gave him his fill of it. “Then, you had big Hugh McGrogan, Paudis Da, running around at midfield, kicking the shite out of Damian Barton. There was no respect given whatsoever.” It was dog eat dog. And it needed to be. This was to be the year. “Rabbiand Sam , our managers, picked  seniors against  reserves, so we would learn how to play together in games.” The seniors never overran their reserve counterparts. “Not a chance,” Gutty stresses. The seniors never won by any more than four or five points, with the reserves winning the odd game. It worked wonders when it mattered. “Any time we were down by a couple of points , that team didnt know when it was beat. Now it mightnt have been the silkiest team, but boys just never quit,” Hugh admits. After three years of knocking on the door, with the pain of defeat lingering like a dark cloud and with the younger players beginning to mature, it was time to die dog or shite the licence. *** There was another ingredient. Sam Bateson is described by McGlone as the tactician with his managerial partner Thomas Fullerton also knowing his football. The perfect match. Fullerton, a reserve winning captain, was playing with McGlone in a  Graham Cup game. Magherafelt were running them ragged and led by six or seven points at the interval. “It was one of the first times I saw we had steel and other teams didnt have, Thomas went f**king ballistic at half-time,” Gutty remembers. It was a watershed moment. The law was laid down. Like the rest of the team, McGlone imposed himself. They were like men possessed and won the game well. “I was niggling with my man and remember him filling my mouth when we began to get on top,” said McGlone, who walked off the pitch with blood running out of his nose. “Hes not playing football in the next round, but we are,” Rabbi uttered to him, with a laugh. “Thats when I thought, the odd slap in the mouth doesnt matter, as long as you come out on the right side of it.” Another piece of valuable advice was dished out by John McErlain who often played in front of him on the left wing. In his early days, McGlone would often hoof the ball to safety. As a young buck, and under pressure, it was safer than getting caught in possession. “John roared at me one day in a league game,” he remembers. “I was told to either use the ball up the wing or just lay it off. Its those wee things that helps you when you are growing up.” As the  season began to grow, Newbridge beat  champions Bellaghy in the first round, followed by a hard-earned victory over  winners Glenullin and a semi-final encounter win over Banagher. It took them to the decider against neighbours Castledawson. Midway through the first-half, Brian McErlain was sent off. In the reshuffle, Damian Barton dropped back to centre-back. “Damian was that good with the long pass, that we didnt really have to attack and we could keep six at the back,” McGlone said of his captain. “He was able to get the ball to Devand Paddy Barton up there. On that day, I thought the Newbridge defence was outstanding...everybody. It was tight, it was hard hitting and Castledawson didnt get going.” They knew that Eamonn Heaney wasnt going to make Dawsons starting team, but would play a part. He had played at full-back in the  final, but was now threw in at full-forward to help rescue the game. It wasnt long before Rabbi was out over the sideline to instruct McGlone to do a marking job on Colm McKee for the remainder of the game, having blotted out the substituted Mickey Hughes. “Neither me or Colm touched the ball, but the management had trust in us. I was the youngest man on our team and they were happy to leave me on their county man.” Having played in three county finals and losing two of them, McGlone – who has a memory for detail that matches his enthusiasm – always remembers the call for stewards to pick up their end of match positions. “Its one of the worst feelings you could have as a footballer when you are getting beat by two or three points,” he recalls. One year on from hearing it against Lavey in , they led Castledawson when the announcement bellowed out. He remembers dampening Eoin Gribbins joy at the thought of having their clutches on that elusive championship. “One goal and they are back in it,” McGlone warned him. “In the Lavey game, it seemed to last  seconds until the final whistle, but when it was called that year , we were ahead...it seemed like an eternity until the whistle.” Newbridge were not to be caught. They kept their promise from  months earlier and Damian Barton collected the John McLaughlin Cup after a -year gap, for their th and last title. From McGlones recollection, win lose or draw, Wilfie Garvin, Mick McKenna, Jim Gilmore, Seamus and Dermot Doherty, Owen and Willie Gribbin would always be in the Newbridge dressing room after games. They were part of the teams fabric. “I remember those boys being in the day we won it and I was never as glad to see it. Its one of the wee things I will always remember.” Later in the evening the team went for a meal at the ONeill Arms in Toome, before heading back to Newbridge Hall for the celebrations. McGlone wasnt a teetotaller, he enjoyed a drink like most of the others and it was curbed during the championship preparations. “I never touched drink the night we won the championship, not one pint,” Gutty said of his premeditated decision. “I wanted to savour the whole thing and not to be talking to the older men around the club and me maybe half tight.” The next two or three days were dferent. Between the Elk and the Thatch, it was party central. On the Monday night, the squad did a tour of Newbridge on the back of Mick McKennas lorry.   Derry champions Newbridge “Everyone was on the back of er,” Gutty laughs. “We went down to Toome to pick up Stephen McErlain and then did every road in Newbridge. You wouldve thought there were  cars behind us. For the next two or three days, I dont think we sobered.” They were at the top of Everest. But surprisingly, being one of the most consistent teams of the time, it was the only senior championship that crop won. In , they took the foot off the pedal and lost to Ballinascreen in the semi-final who were beaten by eventual All-Ireland champions Lavey. “In  Eugene Young came in to manage us and we got to the final. We missed two goals and theyscored two goals, that was the dference in us winning another one.” While picking up intermediate silverware in the interim, he recalls the disappointment of relegation in  after surviving for three or four seasons in play-offs. “To start your career with a championship medal in your pocket at  or , struggling and relegation was tough. To go from being top of the pile...from walking around behind bands, to relegation, it was tough.” McGlone picked up an intermediate medal in , but when the same title ed five years later, he had stepped away from the seniors, choosing to play with the reserves. Gutty was coaxed out back into the senior ranks by manager Gavin Devlin for an impact role at full-forward, using his guile to pull full-back lines of position. A dead leg suffered in , a niggle that never fully cleared up told McGlone it was time to pull the pin. In retirement, he was never going to step away from the game he loved. The buzz in his voice, with every word dancing, speaks volumes for his fanaticism for football. He stayed on as long as he could, with the club having little youth coming through. It was time to dig new foundations and survey the lie of the land in the local school. “There were big numbers from U down, so we decided wed start with the underage,” states Hugh, who had the help of Neil Young, Martin Gribbin and Gabriel Farren. It was the clubs first U U group, as part of a unofficial South Derry underage initiative. With clubs coaching for three weeks and playing a blitz on the fourth week. “We couldnt believe it, when all  of them turned up at the first session,” he said of a group that supplied seven players to the senior team beaten by Slaughtneil in last years championship. “By U, CKcame in to help. He had taken teams around Newbridge that boysdidnt want, hed step up. Noel McPeake and Sean McKenna came in too and helped.” After winning the U B league and championship, McGlone took a break before ing at minor level and asked for another step up in class. At the pre-season meeting he asked those in the room with two B medals to stand up. “About  percent stood up and when asked who has at least one , and the rest of them stood,” McGlone states. It was time to move up to the A grade. In their first game, they were away to Slaughtneil and unlucky not to beat a team who were U champions two years earlier. After losing heavily to Magherafelt in the Hughes McElwee Cup, the league game between them finished in a draw.  The  Newbridge U U  “If you win a Byou have to step up to A. We were not going to win anything. If we played somebody and there was  points in it and we played them a second day and there was two points in it, we are progressing.” McGlone expressed. He was looking further down the track. His sons are now playing on the senior team, he helped shape. In recent years, they picked up another intermediate title and are back in the top flight. Hopefully to stay. “Now we have a  again that,nurtured right, can dine at the top table again. Hopefully...I am one of the men that is going in around the dressing room in the next five or six years like the older boys did when we won.” Guttys fanaticism has never diluted, nor is it likely to.

His younger years coincided with a bright spell in the clubs history. He spoke to Michael McMullan about losing championships, winning the John McLaughlin Cup and building for the future. Gutty McGlone is no dferent to any other competitor. Defeat hits him like a sledgehammer. It festers to the very pit of his stomach. Its county final afternoon in  and an emerging Lavey team savour the sweet aroma of victory. Inside, in the corner of the Glen dressing room, McGlone reflects. The remnants of their - to - defeat get tossed through his mind again, something only disappointment can do. googletag.cmd.push The pitter patter of water in the adjoining shower area stops. The noise you only hear above the eerie silence of failure. John McErlain, Liam Devlin and Damian Barton emerge. Their confab draws a common conclusion. They had left three titles behind them. Next year will be dferent. In , -year-old McGlones debut season, the Bridge didnt stand up for themselves in the championship against Ballinderry, before losing the game. Eamonn Coleman was manager and after making him a regular from the mid-point of the league, Hugh wasnt selected for the championship defeat to the Shamrocks, with Coleman later confessing it was about protecting him for a career ahead. He just wasnt ready. googletag.cmd.push Three years earlier, torn ligaments in McGlones right ankle, sustained in school action for St Pius, worked out for the best. “Before that, I couldnt kick with my weak foot,” recalls Hugh, who would later coach at underage and engineer the foundations for the current senior team. He remembers the late Brendan Convery insisting on ato school training once he could walk, before arming him with a bag of balls. “Convery made me stand on the and kick every ball into the goals with my left foot. The next week, he made me go to the ,” McGlone clearly remembers. The man who managed Laveys All-Ireland winning team was developing McGlone without him even knowing. “I gradually got stronger and stronger and thats where I ended up playing at left corner back for the Bridge seniors at , because I had two feet and was able to go up the line...that was all down to Brendan Convery.” St Pius annexed an U Vocational Schools All-Ireland, with McGlone on board. A year later, in , Derry minors, who played most of the game with  men following the first-minute dismissal of Gregory McCloskey, were beaten by a point in Newry by Down, who went on to win the All-Ireland. McGlone lined out at corner back and a year more experienced, had established himself as a regular on the Bridge senior team. Once again, they crossed paths with Ballinderry. After having previously taken two games to beat Magherafelt, they met the Shamrocks in the infamous semi-final replay encounter at Greenlough. Newbridge came through to play Dungiven in a final.  The Newbridge team pictured before the  Derry senior final It wasnt to be. Newbridge were going to stand their ground this time. Familiarity bred contempt and after another tempestuous battle with the Shamrocks, which saw pitch invasions, Newbridge were thrown out leaving Dungiven to be awarded the title in the boardroom. Losing was becoming a habit and in the aftermath of their  defeat, before leaving Glen, they made a pact. “We are going to learn from this,” McGlone relays of the collective dressing room message. “We left one , we didnt get playing in oneand now we have lost one. We are not going to lose another one.” *** You earned your corn at Newbridge training. The championship jersey wasnt handed out willy nilly. Gutty McGlone, the youngest of seven boys in a house of  children, would leave home for the short walk to the hall for a Saturday pre-championship meeting before the  final. He was unnecessarily uneasy. “Im not sure of my position here,” McGlone thought. He was ever-present and never substituted during the year, but Stephen Walls, an All-Ireland minor winner with Derry in , was breathing down McGlones neck. “Thats the class of player we had on the bench. I knew I had played well, but because of the competition at the time in the Newbridge team, I was thinking I could get a gunk here I knew the pressure was on, thats why you had to perform.” It was an era that secured back-to-back senior leagues in  and , as well as three reserve championships inside five years. “This just wasnt about the senior team, those three teams were the pinnacle of us winning thechampionship in ,” McGlone stated, in no uncertain terms. Before emphasising it again. “We played games at training during ...it was a senior team against a reserve team. We struggled to beat them, so that shows you the class of talent we had in Newbridge at that time.” McGlone name-checks Mickey McGrogan and Shane Doherty as some of the forwards who trotted into his left corner back area in training games, players not even listed on the -man match-day  for the final. And they gave him his fill of it. “Then, you had big Hugh McGrogan, Paudis Da, running around at midfield, kicking the shite out of Damian Barton. There was no respect given whatsoever.” It was dog eat dog. And it needed to be. This was to be the year. “Rabbiand Sam , our managers, picked  seniors against  reserves, so we would learn how to play together in games.” The seniors never overran their reserve counterparts. “Not a chance,” Gutty stresses. The seniors never won by any more than four or five points, with the reserves winning the odd game. It worked wonders when it mattered. “Any time we were down by a couple of points , that team didnt know when it was beat. Now it mightnt have been the silkiest team, but boys just never quit,” Hugh admits. After three years of knocking on the door, with the pain of defeat lingering like a dark cloud and with the younger players beginning to mature, it was time to die dog or shite the licence. *** There was another ingredient. Sam Bateson is described by McGlone as the tactician with his managerial partner Thomas Fullerton also knowing his football. The perfect match. Fullerton, a reserve winning captain, was playing with McGlone in a  Graham Cup game. Magherafelt were running them ragged and led by six or seven points at the interval. “It was one of the first times I saw we had steel and other teams didnt have, Thomas went f**king ballistic at half-time,” Gutty remembers. It was a watershed moment. The law was laid down. Like the rest of the team, McGlone imposed himself. They were like men possessed and won the game well. “I was niggling with my man and remember him filling my mouth when we began to get on top,” said McGlone, who walked off the pitch with blood running out of his nose. “Hes not playing football in the next round, but we are,” Rabbi uttered to him, with a laugh. “Thats when I thought, the odd slap in the mouth doesnt matter, as long as you come out on the right side of it.” Another piece of valuable advice was dished out by John McErlain who often played in front of him on the left wing. In his early days, McGlone would often hoof the ball to safety. As a young buck, and under pressure, it was safer than getting caught in possession. “John roared at me one day in a league game,” he remembers. “I was told to either use the ball up the wing or just lay it off. Its those wee things that helps you when you are growing up.” As the  season began to grow, Newbridge beat  champions Bellaghy in the first round, followed by a hard-earned victory over  winners Glenullin and a semi-final encounter win over Banagher. It took them to the decider against neighbours Castledawson. Midway through the first-half, Brian McErlain was sent off. In the reshuffle, Damian Barton dropped back to centre-back. “Damian was that good with the long pass, that we didnt really have to attack and we could keep six at the back,” McGlone said of his captain. “He was able to get the ball to Devand Paddy Barton up there. On that day, I thought the Newbridge defence was outstanding...everybody. It was tight, it was hard hitting and Castledawson didnt get going.” They knew that Eamonn Heaney wasnt going to make Dawsons starting team, but would play a part. He had played at full-back in the  final, but was now threw in at full-forward to help rescue the game. It wasnt long before Rabbi was out over the sideline to instruct McGlone to do a marking job on Colm McKee for the remainder of the game, having blotted out the substituted Mickey Hughes. “Neither me or Colm touched the ball, but the management had trust in us. I was the youngest man on our team and they were happy to leave me on their county man.” Having played in three county finals and losing two of them, McGlone – who has a memory for detail that matches his enthusiasm – always remembers the call for stewards to pick up their end of match positions. “Its one of the worst feelings you could have as a footballer when you are getting beat by two or three points,” he recalls. One year on from hearing it against Lavey in , they led Castledawson when the announcement bellowed out. He remembers dampening Eoin Gribbins joy at the thought of having their clutches on that elusive championship. “One goal and they are back in it,” McGlone warned him. “In the Lavey game, it seemed to last  seconds until the final whistle, but when it was called that year , we were ahead...it seemed like an eternity until the whistle.” Newbridge were not to be caught. They kept their promise from  months earlier and Damian Barton collected the John McLaughlin Cup after a -year gap, for their th and last title. From McGlones recollection, win lose or draw, Wilfie Garvin, Mick McKenna, Jim Gilmore, Seamus and Dermot Doherty, Owen and Willie Gribbin would always be in the Newbridge dressing room after games. They were part of the teams fabric. “I remember those boys being in the day we won it and I was never as glad to see it. Its one of the wee things I will always remember.” Later in the evening the team went for a meal at the ONeill Arms in Toome, before heading back to Newbridge Hall for the celebrations. McGlone wasnt a teetotaller, he enjoyed a drink like most of the others and it was curbed during the championship preparations. “I never touched drink the night we won the championship, not one pint,” Gutty said of his premeditated decision. “I wanted to savour the whole thing and not to be talking to the older men around the club and me maybe half tight.” The next two or three days were dferent. Between the Elk and the Thatch, it was party central. On the Monday night, the squad did a tour of Newbridge on the back of Mick McKennas lorry.   Derry champions Newbridge “Everyone was on the back of er,” Gutty laughs. “We went down to Toome to pick up Stephen McErlain and then did every road in Newbridge. You wouldve thought there were  cars behind us. For the next two or three days, I dont think we sobered.” They were at the top of Everest. But surprisingly, being one of the most consistent teams of the time, it was the only senior championship that crop won. In , they took the foot off the pedal and lost to Ballinascreen in the semi-final who were beaten by eventual All-Ireland champions Lavey. “In  Eugene Young came in to manage us and we got to the final. We missed two goals and theyscored two goals, that was the dference in us winning another one.” While picking up intermediate silverware in the interim, he recalls the disappointment of relegation in  after surviving for three or four seasons in play-offs. “To start your career with a championship medal in your pocket at  or , struggling and relegation was tough. To go from being top of the pile...from walking around behind bands, to relegation, it was tough.” McGlone picked up an intermediate medal in , but when the same title ed five years later, he had stepped away from the seniors, choosing to play with the reserves. Gutty was coaxed out back into the senior ranks by manager Gavin Devlin for an impact role at full-forward, using his guile to pull full-back lines of position. A dead leg suffered in , a niggle that never fully cleared up told McGlone it was time to pull the pin. In retirement, he was never going to step away from the game he loved. The buzz in his voice, with every word dancing, speaks volumes for his fanaticism for football. He stayed on as long as he could, with the club having little youth coming through. It was time to dig new foundations and survey the lie of the land in the local school. “There were big numbers from U down, so we decided wed start with the underage,” states Hugh, who had the help of Neil Young, Martin Gribbin and Gabriel Farren. It was the clubs first U U group, as part of a unofficial South Derry underage initiative. With clubs coaching for three weeks and playing a blitz on the fourth week. “We couldnt believe it, when all  of them turned up at the first session,” he said of a group that supplied seven players to the senior team beaten by Slaughtneil in last years championship. “By U, CKcame in to help. He had taken teams around Newbridge that boysdidnt want, hed step up. Noel McPeake and Sean McKenna came in too and helped.” After winning the U B league and championship, McGlone took a break before ing at minor level and asked for another step up in class. At the pre-season meeting he asked those in the room with two B medals to stand up. “About  percent stood up and when asked who has at least one , and the rest of them stood,” McGlone states. It was time to move up to the A grade. In their first game, they were away to Slaughtneil and unlucky not to beat a team who were U champions two years earlier. After losing heavily to Magherafelt in the Hughes McElwee Cup, the league game between them finished in a draw.  The  Newbridge U U  “If you win a Byou have to step up to A. We were not going to win anything. If we played somebody and there was  points in it and we played them a second day and there was two points in it, we are progressing.” McGlone expressed. He was looking further down the track. His sons are now playing on the senior team, he helped shape. In recent years, they picked up another intermediate title and are back in the top flight. Hopefully to stay. “Now we have a  again that,nurtured right, can dine at the top table again. Hopefully...I am one of the men that is going in around the dressing room in the next five or six years like the older boys did when we won.” Guttys fanaticism has never diluted, nor is it likely to.

When he came out of the changing room bearing a grey hoodie, with the rest of his team-mates in black and white, you wondered had he even got a jersey. But whatever he dreamt about on the night before, whatever he thought about over dinner, he wouldn’t have believed he would have scored an injury-time goal to win the trophy for his new club and win the man of the match award. googletag.cmd.push That’s exactly how it panned out. The sides level at - apiece, thirty seconds of injury-time played, and a long ball is spilled and flapped at by Ronan Tracey in the Foreglen goal. Poaching on the edge of the small square , as he did time and again in the green and gold jersey, it was a simple task for O’Kane to punch home the winning goal. Some ironies are just written in the stars. This one came in spite of every single ounce of effort Foreglen had to give. Kevin O’Connor was O’Kane’s partner in crime since the two were knee high. They tormented defences in Intermediate football for years. They fought shoulder to shoulder for the green and the gold. googletag.cmd.push O’Connor played like a man possessed. He played like a man who wanted to show the world he didn’t need a partner. The Foreglen forward took Rian Kealey, a superb player, to the cleaners. O’Connor ended up with five points and set up his side’s goal in a magnicent display. That goal, made by O’Connor and finished by James Brolly, looked as though it had swung the balance in the favour of the underdogs with just four minutes to go. Having been behind from the th minute of a rather stagnant first half, Foreglen had worked incredibly hard to stay in touch with the Magpies. A combination of wasteful finishing from Eugene Kelly’s menand superb defending from a young full-back line of Ruairi and Shane Duffy and Cathal O’Hara kept Damien O’Connor’s side in contention. This was no holds barred football. For the young Dungiven side, sprinkled with Kevin Farren, Kevin Johnston, Sean Murray and Donal McGilligan of last year’s minor team, this was probably the toughest game they’ve played, in a physical sense at least. For that, you have to give Foreglen great credit. Brothers John and Oisin Duffy were lost to their defence before the game, having set off travelling on Friday. They’re without Niall McFeely long term. To most teams with as small a pick, those absentees would be terminal against a side that contained six players that played in last year’s senior county final. But when have Foreglen ever laid down  Kevin O’Connor might have kicked the points, but the spadework was done by plenty other. Ciaran McFeely had an excellent game, the best he’s played in some while. He went after everything, especially in the second half. Darren O’Kane’s heart is bigger than his chest. There’s not much of him, but he ploughs into everything. He’s pretty much the Foreglen prototype. They felt the big decisions didn’t go their way. They may have had a point. Directly after Brolly’s goal, Martin Farrell latched on to a great ball from Darren O’Kane. He appeared to be fouled in front of goal but referee Joe Mulholland blew him for over-carrying. Ninety seconds after what turned out to be Darrell O’Kane’s winning goal, Kevin O’Connor was pushed in the chest inside the area as he collected the ball. The referee felt he went down too easily and played on. But for all the feeling of the world being against them, they were lucky to still be in the game at half-time. Having played with a fresh breeze, they were frustrated by constant stoppages over a stop-start  minutes. With  minutes of -a-side football played, the score was just - apiece. It hadn’t caught fire at all. But Dungiven were missing what chances were being made. They kicked ten wides in that half hour. Foreglen had just three points at the break, but just as importantly, they had conceded just five. What the fans were treated to in the second half was night and day from what they had got in the first. It became a rip-roaring game. It effectively became championship. The first seven minutes of the half were scoreless. The stage seemed set. James McNicholl got out well and fed the man coming off his shoulder. That man fired brilliantly past Ronan Tracey from twelve yards. That man had no fear of celebrating his goal. That man was, of course, Darrell O’Kane. Foreglen seemed to react to the identity of the scorer as much as the goal itself. They responded in the most positive manner. Martin Farrell , Ciaran McFeely, Kevin O’Connor and James Brolly hit points in six brilliant minutes to close the gap back to two. Dungiven’s only response in those six minutes came from O’Kane’s right foot. Kevin O’Connor was not letting it go without a fight. His storming run saw Rian Kealey pull him to the ground along the endline. He got up and sprinted out to the ’ and with Dungiven sleeping, took a quick free that left James Brolly with a relatively simple finish from  yards. That levelled it with just four minutes to play. But they couldn’t quite get the score they needed to nose themselves in front. They just didn’t have anything to hold on to. Substitute Fergal McGuigan kicked a  yard free wide and it seemed as though the gods, having rescued Kerry earlier in the day, had dressed themselves in green and gold. But it just had to be Darrell O’Kane’s day. Of all the men in all the world, it just had to be him.

Beverly Simpson moved from Guyana in South America to Derry in  to help the ‘failing health system’. She has two sons and a daughter, who was born in Derry. Mrs Simpson was one of the speakers at the Black Lives Matter rally on Saturday in Derrys Guildhall Square. Speaking to the Derry News this week, Beverly said she felt compelled to speak at the event as people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethniccommunities need a ‘safe outlet to express their feelings’. googletag.cmd.push In relation to opposition to the rally taking place, she believes that certain political parties mobilised the PSNI and in doing so ‘aggravated the situation’. Mrs Simpson said she and her daughter Jada were approached by police before reaching the Guildhall and again by three officers while standing there. “The police were intimidating us, she said. It was a safe space, controlled, we had a voice. “I thought, did police officers just see the colour of my skin and approach me. “They weren’t approaching everyone. Like every organisation there’s an element that think they’re superior. “The rally wasn’t even started when we were approached and they didn’t give us the option of going home. googletag.cmd.push “They annoyed us that much it made us more determined to stay.” She added: “They were trying to put a lid on an active volcano, it will still erupt, but instead of erupting in a controlled manner it will erupt all over the place. “Let it be addressed in a controlled environment, in schools or in church. “People should be able to speak about racism, it’s not going away no matter how many lids are put on it.” Since moving to the city, Mrs Simpson claimed that her entire family have been subjected to racism. “All three of my children have experienced racism, including my -year-old,” she said. “In Derry it may be subtle, not open or staring you in the face, but it’s there and unless we actually speak about it, people get away with it and continue to do it. “Don’t get me wrong, you have people everywhere who are good and bad, you have people in Derry who are not racist. “It’s about people’s moral compass, your ethics and what you value. “Children are born innocent and unless you teach them to hate, and teach them racism, they don’t see the person as another colour. “It is something that is learnt and unless we address our own personal prejudices we’ll get nowhere.” From April  to March , there were  racist incidents, resulting in  crimes, in Northern Ireland. Of those,  occurred in the Derry and Strabane policing district, an increase of  on the previous year. It’s understood that many incidents go unreported. For Mrs Simpson’s daughter Jada, race was never an issue until two years ago. Mrs Simpson said her friends at school are all white and ‘she never saw herself as dferent’. However, an incident in  changed her attitude. “She was at the bus station trying to board a bus when the driver shut the door in her face and drove off, leaving her standing there.” Mrs Simpson said that after viewing footage of the incident, the company apologised and the driver was said to have been disciplined. She continued: “It’s there, and unless each company can do like the bus company, address the inidual who is the rotten egg instead of hiding it, and condoning it or trying to cover it up. Address it openly.” Following the incident, the family felt that somebody had listened to them, but Mrs Simpson said a lot of people are afraid to speak out. “Where does that anger go, where does that hurt go, it stays and grows and infiltrates society.” Confirming the incident, a Translink spokesperson stated: “A complaint was received on thSeptember  at Foyle Street bus station. “This was acknowledged, investigated and followed up. “Translink’s Dignity at Work policy, in which all staff are trained on their induction, makes it clear that we are fully committed to creating a harmonious working environment in which all employees are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of race, colour, ethnic or national origins. “This equally applies to how our staff are expected to treat passengers.” In response to criticism that now is not the right time to hold protests, Mrs Simpson said: “Coronavirus is affecting everyone. It’s affecting the Black, Asian and ethnic minority community more. “We’re being marginalised anyway, we’re being segregated anyway, whether by a natural cause or a man-made cause so give us a chance to speak in a safe space.” The level of support on Saturday surprised Mrs Simpson and she said she was ‘proud’ that people ‘challenged themselves’ by turning out.

These exclusive photographs show the special screens which have been erected at Tinneys Bar in Derry. All other pubs are expected to install similar screens between staff and customers as the hospitality sector reopens following the coronavirus lockdown.  A local blinds shop has been assisting Derry bars and businesses as they prepare to reopen safely. Ace Blinds have been operating in the Derry area, serving the community for over five years and employing local people. As businesses adjust to the so-called new normal after lockdown, they have to enforce social distancing and come up with innovative ways to protect their customers. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, Ace Blinds has fitted ‘COVID- roller shields’ in local bars and the orders have been mounting from other businesses in the city. “It has gone a bit crazy at the minute and we have already taken  orders for bars,” says John Kelly of Ace Blinds. It is new territory for Ace Blinds in terms of the material they are using. “The plastic material suits bars great as they can be moved up and down very easily, not like perspex, and they are a lot easier on the eye for customers, so more friendly. They can be attached to suspension ceilings with a special clip so no drillingneeds be. googletag.cmd.push “The material is easily cleaned, you just hold the bottom bar and wipe clean and it can be secured to bars or the groundneeded.” The company has fitted the bathroom at EI Engineering to separate sinks which provides an extra layer of protection for workers. Other businesses in the town have come to them with dferent proposals which they’re working through together. This week, the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds announced that all non-essential goods retailers in Northern Ireland can re-open from tomorrow. Pubs and restaurants are expected to follow suit in July. Confirming the ‘major step forward’, the Minister said: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the local economy. The recovery has already begun and it is time now for the pace to accelerate. The re-opening of all goods retail outlets will be a huge part of this. “The safety of staff and customers is of course paramount. All retailers must be able to implement measures that minimise the risk to their staff and to the people who visit their stores. “We will be co-existing with this virus for some time to come so it is vital that we continue to adhere to guidance to work and live safely.” The Minister added: “The re-opening of our local shopping sector is a signicant step forward in the Executive’s pathway to recovery. I and my Executive colleagues remain committed to moving forward in the recovery while at all times keeping the health, wellbeing and safety of people at the centre and being transparent in our approach.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Concern was recently raised that Derry City and Strabane District Council ratepayers were footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the local dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. He asked for vehicles using the council-owned recycling centres to be monitored to assess how big an issue it was. Five of the councils  recycling centres reopened on May  last after being closed from March because of the coronavirus pandemic restrictions. googletag.cmd.push After the recycling centres reopened, council officers noted the registration of all vehicles using them. The information was collated from Monday, May , to Friday, May . The figures, which have been seen by the Derry News, revealed that during that -day period, a total of , cars with Republic of Ireland number plates used the local dumps. The vast majority of Republic-registered vehicles used the Pennyburn recycling centre - a total of . This was just over % of the overall , vehicles which used the Pennyburn dump during this time. Eighty three vehicles with southern number plates used the Glendermott recycling centre during this period, out of a total of , visitors. googletag.cmd.push There were  southern-registered cars which used the Strahans Road dump in Strabane, out of a total of , visitors. The two other councils dumps that reopened on May  - Strathfoyle and Claudy - had no vehicles from the Republic visit them during the period from May  to May . Derry’s recycling centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal, people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free. The issue of usage of the local recycling centres was discussed last week at a meeting of the councils Environment and Regeneration committee. At the meeting, DUP Alderman Ryan McCready proposed that a special meeting of the committee be organised to discuss a number of issues around the recycling centres This included, he said, the dumping of commercial waste at the centres and the number of people from outside the council jurisdiction using the centres. Alderman McCready stressed that he was speaking about anyone from outside the council area, and not just people from Donegal. His proposal was supported by other councillors on the committee. Meanwhile, van drivers who use the local recycling centres are being advised of new arrangements that will come into place from this week. From today, large vans with trailers will only be permitted entry to Strathfoyle and Strahans Road sites during the following revised times - Strathfoyle, between am and am Monday to Saturday, and at Strahans Road between am and am, Monday to Saturday. No large vans with trailers will be accepted at Pennyburn dump. However, large vans will only be permitted access between am and am, Monday to Saturday. A spokesperson for the council said the new arrangements are in place to assist with traffic management arrangements and for safety reasons.

Tucked off the Halfgain road, it is one of Slaughtneils greatest gems. Glenn, who coaches fitness in the wild outdoors with his company Wild Le, was due to celebrate his rd birthday by competing in a half triathlon, before it was cancelled due to the sporting lockdown. “I always try to do something challenging on or around my birthday. I guess it makes me feel alive as my inevitable demise looms ever closer,” Glenn said. It was time to put his creative mind to work and invent a new challenge, something on his doorstep. googletag.cmd.push “I love kettlebells and live in the middle of a nature reserve with loads of footpaths so it meant I could do the challenge without having to travel,” he points out. He has a background in combat sports, primarily Filipino Stick Fighting, is a big lover of tree climbing, cold water wild swimming. “A fellow stick fighter and kettlebell instructor, Dave Hedges, from Dublin completed a mile of swings a few years ago and sowed the seed to do it here.” As part of his challenge he aimed to raise money for local mental health charity, STEPS. After targetting pound as a total, he smashed it and currently has pound, in his Justgiving account. googletag.cmd.push “As someone who has and still does suffer from, at times acute anxiety, raising money for mental health support is a no-brainer,” he explains. “Suicide is the single biggest killer in men under the age of  and the daily number of deaths is going up for both men and women. In Northern Ireland the suicide rate is about double that of England, with almost  percent of our community suffering from mental health issues.” “We are all affected by mental health issues, either directly or indirectly, and its time for it to stop being a taboo subject.” A back injury curtailed Glenns early preparations and he switched rehab mode. His days comprised a series of flexibility routines. “The human body is remarkable at healing and movement is medicine. After a couple of weeks I felt I was good to go, so started doing kettlebell swings daily, building up in volume and then moving onto to the walking swing whereby i take a step forward at the top of each swing.” With over , swings during his iron mile, technique was everything. There was the small matter of managing his hands, such was the wear and tear from the kettlebell. “The kettlebell is constantly moving inside your grip so any hard skin or calluses there tend to rip off,” Glenn outlines. “So I had a weekly routine of filing, shaving and moisturising my hands. They are more rubbery that leathery. “I used a kg kettlebell. This would be fairly light for my average workout but after , swings it felt anything but light. If I do it again i may go up to a kg. The heat was the biggest issue. Within five minutes of his scheduled .am start, he was dripping with sweat. “I was wishing we started two hours earlier, sweat in the eyes and on the palms is less than ideal.” With about  metres to go, Glenn could feel blisters popping on his fingers, but the finish line was in sight. One year older, another challenge met and money raised for a worthwhile cause.

There was substantial damage done to the crop.The farmer continued: ldquoI also had a man who was purposely letting his dog into a field to go to the toilet every morning. This field is used to cut silage for the animals to eat in winter. What these people donrsquot understand is that dog faeces is potentially harmful to cattle.ldquoI appreciate that people like to go for a walk and it is unprecedented times where people are more cautious about meeting people on the roads, but they canrsquot use farmland as recreational ground.ldquoThat is a farmerrsquos work space and every blade of grass is used in farming, eventhere areno cows in the field that they are walking in. The ground is being used for something, be it winter fodder or rotational grazing.ldquoThere are cows calving in my fields and what I am more worried about is that someone is going to get hurt. Cows are extremely volatile around calving season and they will attackthey think their young are in danger.ldquoThe most dangerous animal on a farm is not a bull, itrsquos a newly calved cow. They can and will kill. People think that cows are docile but they can kill.The farmer added: ldquoI am having to look into getting professional CCTV equipment put in place over the land, an expense I could really do without.Mr McGrath said people walking through gated fields, leaving the gates lying open and allowing the livestock to get out placed an ldquounnecessary burden on farmers.ldquoWith some Covid- restrictions being eased itrsquos great to see that people are able to get out and about a bit more whether that be for walking their dogs, going for a longer walk or run or just getting out and about. We need to make full use of our wonderful natural surroundings for our own health and for our own emotional and psychological wellbeing.ldquoHowever, there are issues creeping in regarding walkers and runners using gated fields and pieces of farmland as access points whether for a shortcut or just because they feel they can do this.He continued: ldquoWhen I was growing up in Downpatrick you didnrsquot dare trespass on the land. There was enough respect for the farmer and the great contribution they make to our local communities and as a child probably a healthy level of fear as well.ldquoI want our communities to respect our farmers and to appreciate that they give to the community so much more than they get back.ldquoSoyoursquore out and about and enjoying your walks or runs, please stick to the public roads and public rights of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A walk in the pairc  ","story":"LOCAL GAA clubs are gearing up for ato action.After a three-month lockdown caused by the Covid- pandemic, clubs can look forward to a resumption of gaelic games.Thatrsquos good news for players and spectators, who have been starved of action.The clubs were able to unlock their gates for the first time this week.From Monday they were allowed to open their grounds for small groups of people to use walkways.Non-contact training for club teams will begin on June , initially in groups of no more than ten players with two coaches.Full-contact training can take place from July , with underage games commencing on the same date.

The industry directly employs , people, with thousands more supported in work through the supply chain.The impact of the virus on the sector could be devastating, Baroness Ritchie told peers during a debate on measures needed to repair the UK economy.ldquoProjections indicate that this level of employment could be reduced by  per cent, she said. ldquoThere has been no spend in the tourism industry since March  and it will be late July before tourism outlets open.ldquoMany of those people who will find themselves out of work will have to rely on the benefit system which is already under extreme pressure. It is punitive and needs to be overhauled with the needs of people put at the centre of the debate.She continued: ldquoTo encourage visitors to come to our region to spend money and to invest in our economy, we need to protect our people.ldquoThat means we must ensure our shops are allowed to open subject to social distancing rules and the British Government needs to abolish air passenger duty and reduce VAT on tourism.ldquoThat would assist our hospitality industry and those employed in it as well as the many people who depend on it for their basic source of income. These fiscal measures could indirectly make contributions to reducing inequalities in our society and community. Baroness Ritchie said the furloughing of many staff within the hospitality sector was currently concealing the true extent of the job losses that would follow when the scheme was ended.She also said the pandemic had revealed the ldquodeep levels of poverty and inequalities that are entrenched within many communities.She went on: ldquoThere have been greater levels of dependence on food banks for essential food provisions.

the reinstatement of services at the Downe Hospital.Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Alliance councillor Patrick Brown are both demanding the full restoration of services which were removed at the height of the Covid- pandemic.Baroness Ritchie says she has pressed health chiefs on the issue, but to date has not been given a timeline by the South Eastern Trust.ldquoIt is important that the work on the reinstatement of services and staff continues and that the timeline for doing so is published so that the public is fully aware of all the circumstances, she said.ldquoUndoubtedly, all the staff in the Downe Hospital, including medical, nursing and ancillary, have worked with very dficult challenges over the last few months and they deserve our support, solidarity and congratulations.Baroness Ritchie said she had been told equipment will be ed to the Downe and that the Trust was progressing plans for the rebuilding of non-Covid health and social care services.She said she had pressed senior management on the provision of endoscopy services at the Downe and was informed that the service recommenced in the day procedure unit on June .She said  patients were examined during the first session and that the Trust currently had  patients on their lsquored flag escalation listrsquo for endoscopy services.She said priority was being given to those with higher risk of cancer at this stage. ldquoThese patients are getting access to urgent endoscopy usually within the three-week target, she remarked.She added: ldquoIn response to my query about the scoping work for additional services to be provided at the Downe Hospital, the Trust has informed me that planning for the provision of services to be delivered from the day procedure Unit at the Downe Hospital is part of the overall work the Trust is progressing in relation to the rebuilding of non-Covid  health and social services.ldquoIt is also anticipated that other day case surgical work will recommence shortly afterwards.Cllr Brown called on the Trust to reconsider its decision to engage with a private firm to offer endoscopy treatment at the Downe and to reinstate the AE department, as well as investing in what he said were ldquomuch-needed services for the local community.He claimed privatising healthcare put limits on those who could receive treatment.ldquoOur constituents should have access to high quality local services, he said.ldquoWhilst the dficult and unprecedented circumstances caused by the Covid- pandemic have undoubtedly added a strain on hospital resources, the decision to involve a private contractor for endoscopy treatments should be swtly reconsidered.ldquoInstead, efforts should be made to find a cohesive solution with current medical staff and relevant unions, in order to safeguard our local services.He continued: ldquoThe decision to close the AE Department in Downe Hospital was taken to reallocate resources and staff to other hospitals to help fight Covid-, especially at the peak of the virus.ldquoWhilst it is understandable that medical services needed to adapt as a response to the outbreak, Downe Hospital failed to have a sufficient offering in terms of emergency medical care prior to the pandemic, with an AE Department that only operated for  hours of the day.Cllr Brown said a global health crisis should not be used as an excuse to remove or rationalise health services.He remarked: ldquoDowne Hospital is a vital local employer and necessary for the health and wellbeing of residents across the District.ldquoLocal rural constituents should not have to worry that they wonrsquot have adequate access to healthcare, as services have been displaced to Belfast or Dundonald.ldquoThere is a clear need to invest in services, restoring those lost

Crops lay flat in the fields from the constant pounding of the rain. As a family of farmers it was an extremely dficult time.ldquoIn between the deluges we managed to scramble our way to the first Irish Senior Cup final and emerged victorious mdash a rare moment of sunshine that year.For Paul, then a teenager still at school, the memories of  years ago are still vivid.ldquoIt was my first year in the st XI, playing alongside my father and Alfie. They were  and  years young at that time and still playing well.ldquoIn fact, the following year, in the same competition, I sat in amazement watching Alfie blast a ton against a Bangor with John Elder leading the attack, having opened the bowling for Ireland against Australia earlier that summer in front of , people at Downpatrick.ldquoAnyway, Alfie smashed nine huge sixes, all clearing the Strangford Road end. This was at a spritely age of .ldquoAll of a sudden I realised the legendary tales of Alfiersquos big hitting were true. Dad always said he hit the ball much further than anyone . That innings remains the most memorable I have seen from a Downpatrick player. saw the ICU as it was then bring in bowl-outs to decide washed-out contests, with all  players trying to hit the stumps in a shoot-out.In the first round Downpatrick faced Leinster and of the  players who aimed, only one was successful mdash the aforementioned Alfie.Downpatrick had reached the final after a famous win in the lionrsquos den of Donemana, with Brian Ferris and Jim Patterson smashing unbeaten fties in an emphatic victory.ldquoThere was a lot of publicity surrounding the Irish Senior Cup which at that time was sponsored by Schweppes, said Paul.ldquoIn the years that followed, just like the inter-pros played for the Guinness Cup, everyone simply called the competition lsquoThe Schweppesrsquo. In more recent times, the Ulster Cup was known as lsquoThe Clubturfrsquo.ldquoBefore the final, BBC TV sent a crew down to interview some of us, and ironically record us bowling at the stumps. It was still raining. It took us ages to hit the stumpshellipI got abuse at school.ldquoNeedless to say, the final was washed out without a bowl bowled and the miserable summer continued. It was desperately disappointing after a week of huge anticipation.The toss for the venue of the replay was conducted over the phone between the two captains, Ian Shields and Derek McCann.Downpatrick won and the replay was scheduled for midweek, Wednesday, September , and North Downrsquos Robin Haire recalls the conditions werenrsquot really fit for cricket.ldquoDownpatrick had actual puddles of water on parts of outfield, he recalled. ldquoMy abiding memory of that final was the spray of the water when you hit it along the ground.ldquoIt was totally unplayable, but the authorities wanted it played and out of the way. Nowadays umpires would have said try tomorrow.The decider itself proved to be a turgid, low-key affair, with little atmosphere and a contest which matched the gloomy conditions.ldquoIt just felt like a midweek league game, said Paul Linehan. ldquoPeople were at work, there was no crowd to speak of, it was cold and it wasnrsquot much of a game.ldquoNorth Down batted first, we bowled and fielded brilliantly, and they scraped to just . Karl Quinn and man of the match Philip Lennon each took three wickets, Jim Patterson got two, while Brian Hodges and Brian Ferris got one apiece.ldquoWe opened with Keith Malone and Derek McCann and I was due to come in three. I was a very nervous  year-old when I arrived at the wicket after they had put on . Keith was going well and I just needed to stay in.ldquoAnyway, desperate to get off the mark, I predicted Robin Haire was going to bowl me a long hop. I was right back on the stumps, ready to smash it, when he fired in a quicker ball which crashed into my ankles in front of middle. Out for a duck in the All-Ireland Cup final. I was beyond devastated as cricket was everything to me.ldquoWe eventually won by six wickets as our experienced side adopted a safety-first attitude, taking no risks. Derek McCann lted the famous trophy and Downpatrick were All-Ireland champions.There were to be no champagne celebrations for the teenager though.ldquoUnfortunately, I was too young to down a couple of beers, so it was straight back home after the final for Dad and I, two All-Ireland champions.Six years later, Downpatrick would secure the trophy for the second time in one of the most thrilling encounters ever, overcoming North by three runs.There was to be no personal glory though for Paul Linehan as he missed out on the chance of redemption.ldquoThe disappointment of making a duck remains as I was never to play in another All-Ireland final, having been injured for the  victory, he said.ldquoHowever, all these years later, my  medal is still very much a prized possession..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C June 10%2C 2000  ","story":"TYRELLA mdash Tyrella beach has retained a prestigious European award which recognises the quality of the local tourist facility.The beach is one of eight in the province to receive the highly sought after Blue Flag Award, the highest possible recognition for cleanliness.Down Council chiefs are delighted Tyrella has once again been recognised for its quality, and the amount of effort they put into maintaining it, in the annual Tidy Britain Group awards.The awards were officially handed over on Monday along with the prestigious Blue Flag which will continue to fly high over Tyrella for the next  months.The beach was rigorously examined in an unannounced inspection by a  of European experts who focused their attention on cleanliness and the environmental management of Tyrella.Council official Leonard Lawson said everyone was delighted their efforts have again been recognised.ldquoThe award also recognises the councilrsquos effort to manage the beach, provide information points, educational material and detailed displays in the beach centre, he said.ldquoThe water quality is also critical to ensure Blue Flag status is retailed and the council aims to continue to work hard to maintain its high standards.NEWCASTLE mdash Armed robbers made off with over pound, in cash yesterday morning after a hold-up at a Newcastle bank.The three masked men burst into the Northern Bank in Main Street at .am and order everyone inside to co-operate.

It is hard to believe that it has taken  years to get to the stage we are at now at, but the sight of new homes going up is welcome, he continued.ldquoWhile the regeneration of this part of Downpatrick is vital, so is the impact the new homes project will have on addressing a critical shortage of social housing. Many of those in need of a new home are in the urgent need category and the sooner tenants can start to move in, the better.Cllr Curran explained that those in the urgent need category are the priority as far as housing providers are concerned.He also hopes that given the progress that is being made at the former hospital site that families may be able to move in before December.The councillor said the new social housing project will benefit the wider community by providing construction jobs and boosting buildersrsquo suppliers and hopes that those on the waiting list for homes in the town will be offered the new properties.He added: ldquoThis eagerly-awaited scheme is ridding Downpatrick of a derelict site which will be transformed to deliver modern homes in an area of high demand.Local SDLP MLA Colin McGrath also welcomed the plannersrsquo approval.He said: ldquoThe housing development at the old Downe site has been a protracted and drawn out process.ldquoHaving been in regular contact with Clanmil to see what were the outstanding issues holding this development back to hear that council planners are to approve the next stage of the development at long last is very

initiative aimed at revitalising Ardglass harbour are expected to be published before the end of the month.Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots is due to unveil the first stage of a report from the Fishing and Seafood Development programme whichwill include a timeline for work that needs to be done at Ardglass and the other Co Down ports of Kilkeel and Portavogie.Earlier this year, Mr Poots met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss the future of the village port.They highlighted the importance of the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy and outlined planned improvement work at the harbour, including deepening it to facilitate larger herring and mackerel vessels.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran emphasised the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure, insisting that the port receives its fair share of funding to help enhance the existing fleet.They said that the harbour was ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed in Ardglass.The politicians said additional investment is critical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand with appropriate slipways provided for larger vessels to dock safely.Several weeks after the meeting with Mr Poots it was revealed that ambitious plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.Cllr Curran, who is keen to hear what Mr Poots has to say in a few weeksrsquo time, said there were plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He confirmed that consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a ket part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le.ldquoArdglass lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland and deepening the harbour will mean that larger fishing vessels that currently dock where, will be able to access local facilities.Cllr Curran also fears that not deepening the harbour could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the Ardglass fishing industry.He added: ldquoI look forward to hear what the fisheries minister has to say towards the end of the month and hope that it will be positively good news for Ardglass..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Roadworks causing delays in town centre  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK businesswoman has called on Phoenix Gas to complete pipe laying work in St Patrickrsquos Avenue by next Monday mdash as promised.The company is investing poundm investment across East Down and to date has laid over  miles of natural gas pipeline, with contractors also currently working in Newcastle.Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents, with work in Downpatrick starting several weeks ago.A mains pipeline has already been laid in a number of areas in the town, with contractors recently completing work in the Edward Street area.

We would need a period of reasonably wet weather before we would see a signicant change in the levels of most of our reservoirs.“There are a number of steps NI Water can take to alleviate the stress on reservoirs including a hosepipe ban.However, the key to conserving water is public action now.How we all use our water now will have a massive impact on our water levels during the summer months and on whether a hosepipe ban will be required.“For example, we know from the increase in our night usage some customers are leaving sprinklers and hoses on overnight we are appealing to them to stop.A sprinkler left on overnight is enough to meet the daily water needs of  families. We are also asking people to think before they use their pressure washer. Could the task be put off until we are out of this dry period  “However, the easiest way for everyone to save a little water and make a big dference is through normal household tasks.If each of us turned off the tap when brushing our teeth, in a month we would save enough water for the daily handwashing of  people.  “Similarly,you put a jug of water into the fridge rather than running the tap, those actions alone would save approximately  litres per day.This is enough to keep  people hydrated for a whole day! “We want everyone to enjoy their home and garden, we just need people to think about how they use their water andwhat they are doing is essential.If it is not essential we would really appeal to people not do it at the moment.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

However, despite the terms of the contract having been torn apart by the Audit Office and the Assembly’s public accounts committee in , the deal with BT was extended to run until at least  – and civil servants are now negotiating yet another extension beyond that date.Mr Donnelly accepted that BT had performed well in delivering the project but found that it was making exorbitants, while the department was also benefiting from inflated fees, something he said was “an indirect local tax”.Although officials had secured some improvement in terms when they renegotiated the deal, Mr Donnelly said that to this day “LPS customers nonetheless continue to pay too much for the services provided”. He said that “users of the LandWeb Registration Services are being overcharged as the Fees Order  is out of date with fees set too high”, yet the Department of Finance has shown no urgency in updating the fees.Mr Donnelly, who played an important role in bringing the RHI scandal to public attention, found that the way in which the BT contract was extended “is indicative of poor strategic planning by the department”.BT makes its money from the fees the public pay for accessing the Landweb system. When the contract was let, it was estimated that the company would receive £ million. However, that sum has more than doubled to almost £ million a year ago – and continues to rise.Mr Donnelly was critical of the renegotiation of the contract when it could have been ended, noting that the department still does not have full transparency on BT’s profits and scant evidence of how the public has benefited from the renegotiation.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become

including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the

causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

favourite rsquoshoutsrsquo are oddly those which occur in the early hours of the morning on a spring day.ldquoBy the time the job has been completed and the boats are washed down and prepared again for service, we gather on our balcony drinking tea or coffee, watching the sun rise and exchanging with each other our plans for the day ahead, before most other people have woken up.Celebrating the success of the station, current leboat operations manager, Jason Dunlop said ldquoI am incredibly proud to celebrate the stationrsquos -year anniversary.ldquoIt is testament to the community of

Greggs warned sales are likely to remain subdued as the chain copes with fewer customers allowed in stores at any one time, following a series of small-scale trials near its offices.As a result of the expected fall in sales, an unspecied proportion of staff ldquowill remain furloughed until sales levels begin ing to normal, the company said.The Newcastle-based business has taken a tentative approach to reopening, with management keen to avoid any rushes or overcrowding at sites following its three-month closure.Rivals KFC and McDonaldrsquos have seen long car queues for drive-thru services and non-essential retailers were greeted with hundreds of shoppers waiting to snap up a bargain, as stores were able to reopen their doors on Monday.Greggs had been allowed to stay open throughout the lockdown, offering takeaway and delivery services.But bosses declined, saying it felt remaining open would compromise the safety of its employees.Updating the stock market on Tuesday morning, the company added it remains cautious and warned sales may fall.It said: ldquoWe are not able to predict the impact of social distancing on our ability to trade or on customer demand.ldquoHowever, our capacity to operate will be restricted by size of shop and we must anticipate that sales may be lower than normal for some time.ldquoThis will require us to maintain a proportion of our colleagues on furlough, either fully or partially, until sales levels begin ing to normal.ldquoIn anticipation of lower sales, we have limited our initial product range to our best sellers and therefore a number of our manufacturing operational teams will remain furloughed until demand reaches a level that justies the addition of remaining product lines. vw,vw,px, px\"Greggs is also reopening some drive-thrus. Longer term, the company added it has temporarily suspended its new shop opening plans, beyond those legally committed to, with just  new sites expected.Greggs has also spoken to landlords with a ldquoiety of proposals infor rent reductions and will switch to monthly payments from June, following a full quarterly rent payment in March.Chief executive Roger Whiteside said: ldquoLooking forward, although great uncertainty remains, we are excited to be resuming our service for many customers this week.ldquoWe are confident of our ability to adapt to market conditions in the short term while continuing to invest in the long-term growth of our business..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Greggs to reopen  stores on Thursday article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A wide range of services were stood down or scaled back due to the risk of spread of COVID-. New services were introduced to meet the predicted demands of the pandemic. A spokesperson said: With the first peak of the COVID- outbreak in Northern Ireland having passed, the Trust is now focused on planning, with our HSC partners, how to restart services while maintaining sufficient flexibility so that services can respond to future waves of this disease. In working together with our health and social care partners across NI to implement the recovery of non-COVID- HSC Services, the agreed regional approach will be to ensure equity of access to treatment for patients and clients across NI, to minimise transmission of COVID- and to protect the most urgent services. A set of guiding principles in the form of a ‘checklist’ has been established by the Department of Healthto guide service planning. The DoH has asked that service restart plans be assessed against the checklist to ensure that they have been subject to a rigorous risk assessment, take account of new ways of working and can be safely implemented in line with social distancing, use of personal protective equipmentand infection prevention and control requirements.The Western Trust has introduced a Reset Framework to support staff in assessing the impact of scaling up or restarting services and to ensure there is a rigorous and careful approach to planning.A spokesperson continued: The Western Trust Stage  Plan identies the services we have maintained throughout these initial months of the COVID- pandemic across a wide range of areas. It identies those that we will continue and others that we will begin to restart or scale up. It sets out some of the important preparation work needed to provide COVID- safe environments and working practices, to protect our staff, patients and service users. There are a number of constraints which are foremost in the planning process, including availability of PPE availability of drugs and restrictions on the practice of vulnerable staff.Our Stage  plan will focus on:Supporting strong community services for frail or older people. Preparing for the impact of the COVID- pandemic on mental health services. Managing risk, and providing COVID--safe services for staff and our service users. Involving our staff and service users.Speaking about the launch of Stage  of the Trust’s Reset Plan, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Western Trust chief executive, said: “There is no doubt that this has been one of the most dficult periods we have ever had to experience.I would like to thank our community and hospital staff for their hard work and dedication. Members of the public have also been unwavering in their support and this has not gone unnoticed. “There are many challenges which we have faced and will continue to face in the new COVID- environment. Our Stage  plan sets out the steps we are taking to rebuild, reset and make necessary changes to our services into the future.“It is accepted that COVID- remains a public health risk to our population and a phased and flexible approach is needed to restarting services. As a result, the way services are delivered may look and feel dferent. There are opportunities to do things dferently in ways that improve care. Many great initiatives have already begun.” Dr Kilgallen continued: “While there are signicant challenges ahead, the public should be reassured that we are committed to providing the best possible care in environments that reduce the risk of infection for staff and services users alike. We will continue to work diligently to create COVID--safe environments while we rebuild services.” A copy of the rebuilding plan – Stage One can you be found on the Trust website www.westerntrust.hscni.net  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dfbadeaeddfef   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eaafcbffe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
