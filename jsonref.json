I was introduced to them at a house party that I attended in the Washington D.C. area.‘Following that first introduction, I attended well over ten house parties in the Washington D.C. area during the years 1981-1983 where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present…‘On numerous occasions at these parties, I witnessed Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh drink excessively and engage in highly inappropriate conduct, including being overly aggressive with girls and not taking no for an answer. This conduct included the fondling and grabbing of girls without the consent.’      Previously, both Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez have alleged that Kavanaugh engaged in serious sexual misconduct. Ford is slated to testify in the U.S. Senate on September 27 while Ramirez is reportedly ‘willing to testify’ as well.Despite the sexual misconduct allegations made against him, Kavanaugh has vowed not to withdraw his nomination, calling the accusations ‘false and uncorroborated’ and part of a ‘last-minute character assassination’ on him. What\u0026#8217s on Netflix UK October 2018Red Dead Redemption 2 PS4 DLC revealed as Rockstar say game will require 105gb of hard drive spaceStoptober 2018: Public Health England Campaign to quit smoking revealedWho is Roger Mathews?

Was she referring to her passion for Versace or for the £200 million winging into her bank account following the takeover? Her passion for the luxury holidays she loves to share on Instagram, and will now have more time for — or her passion for her family, which has, at times, appeared pushed to breaking point by the cut-throat fashion world?Either her decision to step back has been sudden or kept a fiercely guarded secret. Last September, she was emphatic about staying in her role, saying: ‘I’m not going anywhere right now,’ and, in an interview this month, Donatella waxed lyrical about her beloved brand without so much as a hint.So, what possessed her to hand over the reins of her company?          Gianni Versace with his sister Donatella Versace in 1993. She would inherit the brand after his deathA FUTURE SET IN STONE FROM BIRTHThe daughter of an Italian seamstress, Donatella grew up idolising Gianni, eight years her senior. ‘He made cool leather mini-skirts for me, took me to discos and treated me like a woman,’ she has recalled. ‘I was his doll and his best friend.’Describing her youth as ‘the happiest time of my life’ she was, nonetheless, shackled by her sibling’s success and denied autonomy from an early age.By the time she’d completed a languages degree, Gianni, who founded Versace in 1978, was already a successful designer and Donatella’s fate had been sealed: ‘I finished university and just ran to work with him. Actually, I didn’t have a choice. He said: “You come and you don’t move any more.” ’Perhaps, after having her entire life mapped out, Donatella has finally snapped.BLINDSIDED BY HER BROTHER’S MURDERAs Gianni’s ‘accomplice’ and muse, Donatella schmoozed the stars as Santo took charge of Versace’s business side. Helped by the Versace-clad, newly coined ‘supermodels’ who strutted the catwalk singing George Michael’s Freedom in 1991 and that safety pin dress Elizabeth Hurley wore in 1994, Versace’s status was consolidated.But, on July 15, 1997, the openly gay designer was shot outside his Miami mansion by serial killer Andrew Cunanan, who apparently was jealous of Gianni’s success. Cunanan then took his own life.‘The sight of my dead brother haunts me to this day. One bullet hit his neck, the other his face,’ said Donatella, who was then married to American model Paul Beck, with whom she had Allegra and a son Daniel, now 28.She was shaken both by grief and the responsibility of having her brother’s company foisted upon her, in what she has suggested was an unfair ruse: Gianni, who idolised Allegra, then aged just 11, had left his niece 50 per cent of the company in his will, while Donatella inherited 20 per cent and Santo 30 per cent.In so doing, Donatella says, he not only ‘put a tremendous burden’ on Allegra, but effectively trapped his sister: ‘By giving half of Versace to my daughter, he forced me to take responsibility for the company until she came of age.‘Without this trick, I might have left the company after his death.’          Versace store in Milan. Michael Kors plans to open 900 more Versace stores to double salesDOUBTS, DEBTS AND A DRUG HABITNow in charge, Donatella’s early collections were panned. Having taken cocaine since her 20s, her escalating addiction became an open secret in the industry and her leadership style erratic.According to Deborah Ball, author of the book House Of Versace, Donatella rarely turned up to meetings before noon and, on occasion, openly snorted cocaine in front of staff. ‘For the first five years, I was lost,’ Donatella later admitted. ‘I made a lot of mistakes.’Having boasted sales of more than £400 million in 1997, by 2004 the company was facing debts of around £90 million. Its clothes, capitalising on a Nineties era of conspicuous consumption, seemed increasingly irrelevant in the restrained Noughties and, by the middle of the decade, the business was close to going under.‘I wanted to succeed for Gianni, because he cared so much for the company and I knew he would have wanted it to carry on,’ said Donatella.‘But I was frightened and I had no confidence.’ADDICTION LED TO ELTON’S INTERVENTIONDonatella discovered cocaine in the Eighties at celebrity-studded parties, admitting it fuelled the ‘best time’.According to Gianni’s former partner of 15 years, Antonio D’Amico, the designer was ‘furious’ when he found out about his sister’s habit from their mutual friend, Elton John.‘He was shocked,’ says D’Amico, who describes Donatella as a ‘monster’, on account of her difficult behaviour, and says she ‘became angry, frustrated and suspicious of the people around her. She was very difficult to deal with’. In 2004, during Allegra’s 18th birthday party dinner in Milan, Elton arrived to drag Donatella off to a rehab clinic in Arizona by private plane, where she remained for two-and-a-half months.Donatella says: ‘Some evenings, I couldn’t function any more and embarrassed myself in front of my children. My self-hatred became more and more intense.‘Nobody thought I would accept Elton’s offer, but a few minutes later, I traded my evening gown and diamonds for a jogging suit.‘I made my way to the airport with a ponytail and no make-up.’SAVED BY HER FEMININE REVOLUTIONAFTER emerging from rehab, Donatella focused on collections that contained less of her brother’s brash exhibitionism and were, as she put it, ‘more feminine’. The strategy worked: in 2006, the label posted profits of £14.2 million and, in 2007, sales rose 30 per cent.Recent decisions have proved similarly successful, from the appointment of British CEO Jonathan Akeroyd, hired from Alexander McQueen in 2016, to Donatella dressing her friend and model-of-the-moment Gigi Hadid in a skintight Versace jumpsuit this year. ‘My revolution was successful,’ Donatella said, her pride in the transformation clear-cut — her decision to cash in now less so.CHILDREN WHO SHUN THE LIMELIGHTGiven that Donatella describes Allegra and Daniel as her ‘greatest achievement’, it must be painful that both are deeply uncomfortable in the limelight. They are perhaps the biggest reason for selling up.Allegra — who stands to inherit some £558 million after the Versace sale goes through — is a director of the company, but is not believed to have any great involvement in it. She used her father’s surname to escape her legacy, but admitted in 2011: ‘Anywhere I went, I was Versace. I couldn’t escape and it did me harm.’Daniel, a musician living in London who inherited his uncle’s art collection, is similarly keen to distance himself from his mother.‘He doesn’t want people to know he is my son,’ Donatella has said, admitting that she had promised not to talk about him publicly.          \u0027I\u0027m more of a private jet pooch\u0027 said Audrey Versace, Donatella\u0027s a dogLOVE AFFAIRS AND ‘GORGEOUS GUYS’predatory in her approach to men, yet tight-lipped about her love life, Donatella might want to distance herself from Versace so that she can date in secret.Not that she shows much intention of settling down.‘Men are needed only for love affairs and for physical relaxation,’ she said recently, adding that there have been ‘others’ since her 2000 orce but that: ‘I don’t need a husband or companion. I don’t like to live with anybody. I’m very happy and fulfilled with my private life.’After orcing Beck following 17 years together, she has made little comment about the marriage, other than to say they are ‘estranged’, but ‘civilised’.Her reported second marriage, in 2004, to businessman Manuel Dallori, lasted just a year and has been kept even more secret.She is, however, vociferous about her appreciation for the male form, sizing up a line-up of semi-naked male models on a tongue-in-cheek Instagram video and declaring unashamedly that: ‘I love being surrounded by gorgeous guys.’‘MASK’ OF BLONDE HAIR AND MAKE-UPHaving first had highlights on the instruction of Gianni at the age of 11, her peroxide locks — at times enhanced to waist-length with extensions — are synonymous with her high-maintenance brand: her hairstyle, perma-tan and trademark black kohl-lined eyes an attempt to present a competent façade, especially during times of crisis.‘My hair got blonder and blonder, my make-up thicker and thicker,’ she recalls of the period following her brother’s death.‘I felt like the whole world was looking at me with daggers in their eyes and I created a mask that would give me protection.’Having created ‘a second Donatella: cold and aloof, aggressive and scary’, she says she hasn’t been tempted to change her hairstyle because ‘blonde is a way of life. I survived the catastrophes in my life because of the strength that my blonde hair gives me’.          Donatella Versace (pictured) had this message for fans after Michael Kors bought the brandPROTEIN AND EIGHT ESPRESSOS A DAY At a diminutive 5ft 2in, Donatella says she feels ‘naked’ without high heels — indeed, she even wore them to rehab.Her whippet-thin frame, typically showcased in skintight jeans and dresses from her own line, is the result of ‘hard work’ — she claims to have exercised every day for the past 18 years ‘for at least five minutes’ and does a 45-minute cardio and weights routine four times a week.Donatella — who quit her two packets of Marlboro Red habit in 2013 — once said she stopped seeing a personal trainer because he wouldn’t let her smoke.As for her diet, lunch is salad and protein, with eight espressos a day as well as iced water sipped from a crystal glass to sustain her.PALATIAL HOMES AND LUXURY HOLIDAYSHome for Donatella is a palatial two-storey Milan flat that used to belong to Gianni, with marble columns, gold furnishings and vases of her favourite red roses.Holidays are gleefully showcased to her 3.5 million Instagram followers, from the tour she filmed of her private pool in the Palazzo Versace in Dubai — the £500 million neoclassical palace she opened in 2016 — to the video of her on a yacht with an unidentified topless hunk, and the picture of her lying bikini-clad on her back in aquamarine water, alongside the caption: ‘Wake me up when August ends.’One can only imagine she might get used to a life of leisure. "},{"url":null,"title":"The REAL House STRIFE Cheshire Reality TV couple struggle sell luxury home","story":"    The exterior of Dawn and Ashley Ward\u0027s mansion which has been on the market for five years, despite being in one of the most affluent areas in Cheshire          The dining room of the house is decorated with luxury red leather chairs and has a view of the garden          The pool room at Warford Hall features a jacuzzi and an elaborate chandelier which glistens over the water            Dawn Ward (pictured) lives in the house with husband Ashley Ward and her four daughters.

A person walks on a vegan slogan painted on a crosswalk and reading \u0027animals are not ingredients\u0027, in a street of Lille, northern FranceBoucherie Abolition fights \u0027for the abolition of the genocide called butchery\u0027.Its spokeswoman Solveig Halloin told AFP. \u0027Animal breeding should not be a career. The methods of rearing animals are violent and amount to persecution.\u0027Halloin does not say whether her group is behind the attacks on butcher shops, but neither does she condemn the violence.\u0027The extremists in brutality are the butchers,\u0027 she said.Applying the word \u0027genocide\u0027 to the slaughtering of animals - the term is a specific legal crime applied to the killing of humans on account of their race or identity - reflects the \u0027speciest\u0027 beliefs of radical groups such as Boucherie Abolition.So-called \u0027speciests\u0027 reject the idea of an animal hierarchy that places humans at the top, arguing instead that all animals should be treated equally.Veganism gains ground Last Saturday, Boucherie Abolition and 269 Life France organised demonstrations in front of dozens of butchers\u0027 shops across France.In Paris, Vincent Aubry and another campaigner carried around a young pig - which are prized for their tenderness when roasted.Aubry did not condemn the smashing of butchers\u0027 windows either and he said he was \u0027prepared to go to prison if needed.\u0027\u0027Our only limit is violence against human beings,\u0027 he said.The risk of confrontation between those who depend on rearing and slaughtering animals for their living and those who are determined to stop what they consider to be mass killing appears to be rising.The CFBCT confederation accuses the vegans of \u0027wanting to impose on the immense majority of people their lifestyle, or even their ideology.\u0027Marianne Celka, a researcher at the Paul-Valery University in Montpellier in southern France, sees \u0027no chance of conciliation\u0027 between the two sides.But she highlights how veganism is gaining ground in France, with some major supermarkets now stocking \u0027100 percent vegan\u0027 products - sometimes opposite their meat aisles. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/26/13/50B0C73D00000578-0-image-m-29_1537963443230.jpg","title":"Baby life support switched fell 40ft flats makes incredible recovery","story":"Anwar Nyanzi fell from a fourth floor flat window (pictured left after the accident) when he was just 11 months old and was put on life support at St George\u0027s Hospital in London.

File photo Mr Vince adds that with only 170,000 electric vehicles registered in the UK, just 4 per cent of Ecotricity’s pumps are in use at any one time.But there won’t be many more takers unless the Government encourages far more investment, both in the charging network and in developing better electric vehicles that can go the distance. While it’s true that sales of electric vehicles rose by 28 per cent in the UK over the first half of this year, that’s tiny compared with Australia, where there has been a 98 per cent rise Finland, where sales have gone up by 148 per cent and Canada, with a 168 per cent rise.Dustin Benton, policy director at the Green Alliance, which campaigns for better environmental policies, warns that Britain could end up being one of the last developed nations still prioritising the internal combustion engine over electric vehicles.‘A good comparison is the steel industry, which we didn’t invest in 15 years ago and which now really struggles against its international competitors,’ he says.I’m not convinced the Government, for all its warm words about tackling air pollution and the money it has allocated so far, really understands the problem.It would be a great shame if the electric dream turned into a nightmare because policymakers failed to solve the problems that early adopters like me have experienced so far.For the time being, it seems I’ll have to let the train take the strain — leaving my not-so-trusty electric Nissan connected to its charging point at home, like a patient on a hospital life-support machine."},{"url":null,"title":"Boris never Prime Minister blasts Hammond","story":"    Philip Hammond last night launched a personal attack on former foreign secretary Boris JohnsonPhilip Hammond last night launched a blistering personal attack on Boris Johnson.He said the former foreign secretary was incapable of \u0027grown-up\u0027 politics and did not have a clue how his own proposal for a Brexit deal would work.On the eve of his speech to the Tory Party conference, the Chancellor also said Mr Johnson was doomed to fail in his bid to be the next Conservative prime minister.\u0027I don\u0027t expect it to happen,\u0027 he told the Daily Mail in a candid and wide-ranging interview.Mr Hammond revealed he had repeatedly told Mr Johnson that his \u0027Canada-style\u0027 plan would not work – but Mr Johnson made no serious attempt to defend it.In a withering put down, he said Mr Johnson\u0027s main political achievement was \u0027Boris Bikes\u0027 in his days as London Mayor and he had no grasp of \u0027detail\u0027 when it came to matters of state like Brexit.Mr Hammond shrugged off his cautious \u0027Fiscal Phil\u0027 image and openly mocked Mr Johnson by doing an impression of his trademark plummy vowels and stuttering bluff manner.Asked about Mr Johnson\u0027s attack on Mrs May\u0027s Brexit plan as \u0027supine\u0027 and \u0027deranged\u0027, he said: \u0027Boris is a wonderful character, but he\u0027s never been a detail man.

We will no longer outsource to other countries. We build factories here in America and create jobs. We will provide jobs for all who are free from prisons as we abolish the 13th Amendment. Message sent with love.\u0027  West called for the 13th Amendment to be abolished in the caption of his MAGA selfie Sunday          He clarified his call to abolish the 13th Amendment in two tweets later in the day Sunday, but fans have still be left scratching their heads over the rapper\u0027s bizarre commentsMany fans replied to West\u0027s tweets with direct excerpts from the 13th Amendment, asking him to explain his musings more directly. The amendment reads: \u0027Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\u0027  One user @King_Yunn wrote: \u0027Saying abolish the amendment that also help (sic) abolish slavery without being specific on what you mean by abolishing it...is him purposely being indirect for drama?\u0027Another follower @AlishaFruits wrote: \u0027There’s a hundred different ways he could’ve said it without sounding like an uneducated fool and stirring up unnecessary controversy, but that’s all he’s got.\u0027  One of the sharpest criticisms came from actor Chris Evans, who tweeted: \u0027There’s nothing more maddening than debating someone who doesn’t know history, doesn’t read books, and frames their myopia as virtue. \u0027The level of unapologetic conjecture I’ve encountered lately isn’t just frustrating, it’s retrogressive, unprecedented and absolutely terrifying.\u0027          West\u0027s tweets were met with dozens of responses as some fans asked him to explain his comments more directly and others slammed him for writing nonsense \u0027It\u0027s a political ad for the Dems\u0027: Trump lays into SNL...Share this articleArguably the most prominent theory posed was that West\u0027s critique of the 13th Amendment is centered on a specific clause in the writing which says people who have been convicted of a crime can still be enslaved. One Twitter user behind this theory, @LBS4L, wrote: \u0027he\u0027s obviously referring to the as a punishment for crime part. there is a reason why the US has the most prisoners total and per capita. it\u0027s because prison labor is akin to modern day slavery. he has talked about this in his music before (sic).\u0027 Such an explanation is supported by the fact that during his SNL performance  West wore a sweatshirt with the words \u0027FREE HOOVER\u0027 written across the front.The sweatshirt reportedly refers to jailed Chicago street gang leader Larry Hoover. Hoover founded the Chicago street gang the Gangster Disciples. He is currently serving six life sentences in Florence, Colorado. The sweatshirt is available for sale at $90 on Kanye\u0027s online store.               West sparked confusion during his appearance on Saturday Night Live when he wore a sweatshirt with the words \u0027FREE HOOVER\u0027 written across the front    The rapper said this week he had \u0027redesigned\u0027 the controversial hat and \u0027put positive energy into it\u0027. It is unclear why Kanye was wearing a Free Hoover shirt, but it appears to be related to Chicago gang leader Larry Hoover (right)    West has spoken in support of Trump on several occasions since he was elected to the Oval Office. The pair are pictured at Trump Tower in December 2016However, Trump himself appeared to appreciate Kanye\u0027s words during the show that took aim at the president\u0027s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\u0027Like many, I don\u0027t watch Saturday Night Live (even though I past hosted it) - no longer funny, no talent or charm,\u0027 Trump tweeted on Sunday. \u0027It is just a political ad for the Dems. Word is that Kanye West, who put on a MAGA hat after the show (despite being told no) was great. He\u0027s leading the charge!\u0027 An hour later, Trump randomly declared his confidence in winning the \u0027Black Vote\u0027 - despite the fact he only claimed eight percent of the black vote in 2016.  \u0027So if African-American unemployment is now at the lowest number in history, median income the highest, and you then add all of the other things I have done, how do Democrats, who have done NOTHING for African-Americans but TALK, win the Black Vote? And it will only get better!\u0027 he tweeted on Sunday. Trump then took aim at the FBI investigation into Christine Blasey Ford\u0027s sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, which he only launched after it was demanded by Sen Jeff Flake on Friday.  \u0027Wow! Just starting to hear the Democrats, who are only thinking Obstruct and Delay, are starting to put out the word that the time and scope of FBI looking into Judge Kavanaugh and witnesses is not enough,\u0027 tweeted Trump, who has fought back against claims the White House has severely limited the investigation\u0027s scope.           Donald Trump took aim at Saturday Night Live once again, after his embattled Supreme Court nominee was made the punching bag for the show\u0027s season premiere          An hour later, Trump seemed to feel confident that he would be able to garner the \u0027Black vote\u0027 Watch exclusive videos of Kanye West¿s visit to The FADER | The FADER"},{"url":null,"title":"Up 7 000 British women lied botched breast implants","story":"    A breast implant produced by the implant manufacturer Poly Implant Prothese company (PIP)The firm has allegedly sent writs to people who received compensation  saying it is appealing the EU court order made last year.It said: \u0027As the claimants should have been advised by their lawyers, they will have to reimburse the provisional amounts paid to them if TUV Rheinland wins on appeal.\u0027 In court papers, TUV says that more than 5,000 claimants did not prove they had dodgy implants.\u0027Body brokers\u0027 who prey on drug addicts swindled $6.8...Pregnant women should be told that the risk of placenta...Share this articleOne woman who received compensation for botched implants, Leanne Green, told The Sun: \u0027The very idea that I would lie about having breast implants just to make some cash is sick.\u0027So many of the women involved had the implants after cancer.\u0027To accuse them of lying is about as low as you can get.

The results showed that those who say they feel lonely are likely to have more Facebook friends they do not know offline. Young people also said the least helpful way to end their loneliness that others suggested was to go out dating.Around a third of survey participants also felt that loneliness goes deeper than being on your own and that it is possible to feel isolated in company.          The findings come amid increasing evidence of major changes in the behaviour of young people since the explosion of social media use a decade ago.There have been significant falls in levels of smoking, drug abuse and drinking among the young, while the number of teenage pregnancies has collapsed to a record low – a pattern that has resulted in today\u0027s young being described as \u0027generation sensible\u0027.However, there is evidence that young people are more likely than earlier generations to spend time alone with phones or tablets.According to the ONS, 18-year-olds \u0027spend almost half an hour less a day socialising than 18-year-olds at the start of the milliennium, while time spent watching and listening to films, TV and radio back in 2000 seems to have been replaced by time using computers and gaming\u0027.Heavy use of the internet also exposes young people to the risk of cyber-bullying or being bombarded with fake news and information.Pamela Qualter, professor of psychology at the University of Manchester, who led the latest study, said: \u0027The response to the BBC Loneliness Experiment has been significant. People have provided valuable insights into when and how loneliness is experienced, how it relates to age, being alone, caring responsibilities, employability and discrimination.\u0027For me, the most interesting findings relate to the stigma of loneliness and the varied solutions people had to overcome loneliness. Those findings suggest we need to be kinder to ourselves when we feel disconnected from others, but also that there is a whole toolkit of potential solutions that we can try.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/26/15/01CF6AB80000044D-6210281-image-a-7_1537973666531.jpg","title":"Convicted IRA bomber confronted TV alleged role Birmingham pub bombings","story":"    Firemen at work following the bomb attacks in Birmingham city centre that targeted the Mulberry Bush pub and the Tavern in the Town           A body is carried from the Mulberry Bush pub in Birmingham after it was wrecked by a bomb in 1974The suspect will be named on ITV but newspapers in Northern Ireland and websites that can be viewed there have chosen not to name him.This is because recent laws providing protections against libel claims do not apply in Northern Ireland. The confrontation is an excerpt from a new documentary by the journalist on the pub bombings and who was behind them, which is due to be broadcast at 10.45pm tonight.\u0027Blood on his hands\u0027: PC Keith Palmer\u0027s colleague blasts...‘This man is a hate preacher’: Former UK top cop warns...Share this articleIn the documentary, journalist John Ware names an alleged fellow bomb planter as James Francis Gavin, then 34.

People will pay for this kind of quality and assurance.\u0027  With Inrupt, users can create their own \u0027personal online data store\u0027 - or POD - to house anything from contact lists to music libraries.The technology is designed to bring together the functions of programs such as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, Spotify and WhatsApp in one place.Sir Tim says the intent behind his startup is \u0027world domination\u0027 in an exclusive interview with Fast Company.The site noted that the comment was said in jest - but was also true.\u0027It\u0027s a historical moment,\u0027 Sir Tim said. \u0027We have to do it now.\u0027As of this week, tech developers around the globe can create their own decentralisd apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.Sir Tim is no stranger to the forefront of the technology industry, having been credited with transforming the internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium in 1994.    Sir Tim Berners-Lee created the web in 1989 with the idea that the sharing of information would benefit all mankindHe believes that through Inrupt, he can and will upend the system again, making the long-sought dream of a \u0027free and open digital utopia\u0027 into a reality.\u0027I\u0027m incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web,\u0027 he said.Central to the tech mogul\u0027s philosophy has been shifting control away from online giants who have profited from the web\u0027s current centralisation and back to inidual users.The Inrupt site will serve as a widely-accessible entry point to the tech legend\u0027s already-established open-source platform Solid.One of Solid\u0027s key features is that people are in charge of deciding who can access the information they store within their PODs - which the company refers to as \u0027personal empowerment through data\u0027.Inrupt is said to have the potential to completely upend the business models of companies like Facebook and Google, who have raked in profits from quietly selling user information to third parties.An avid defender of net neutrality, Sir Tim added: \u0027We are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their business models are completely upended overnight. \u0027We are not asking their permission.\u0027 One Small Step for the Web… – Tim Berners-Lee – MediumExclusive: Tim Berners-Lee tells us his radical new plan to upend the"},{"url":null,"title":"Shocking pictures mess tenants left behind","story":"    The landlord said the tenants ruined the kitchen, which was completely covered in dirt with bags of rubbish and waste scattered all over it.

Through this pointillist screen of flecked paint you can see fat little human bodies, huddled with their heads down inside their thick winter clothes, trudging through a village whose roofs are like icing on gingerbread houses. This is, unmistakably, the world of Pieter Bruegel the Elder – a world you can enter as never before in an exhibition at Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches Museum that is like having all-areas access to the world’s wildest carnival. Paintings and drawings from across Europe have come together for this unbelievable blockbuster that lets you wander among seemingly limitless vistas of comedy and horror. I spent three hours there before a guard gently threw me out. I was just getting started.Bruegel’s art is simply more human and generous that anyone else’s. Rembrandt? Picasso? They’re so self-obsessed. Bruegel paints you and me and everyone. In that snow scene he made in 1563, it takes a while to recognise any narrative or symbolism at all. Only on close inspection can you see, through the falling snowflakes, the visitors abasing themselves before a woman and her baby. This is an Adoration of the Magi. I don’t think there’s any Bruegel painting that more beautifully illustrates what WH Auden wrote of his ironic panoramas of all that is human:“How, when the aged are reverently, passionately waitingFor the miraculous birth, there must always beChildren who did not especially want it to happen, skatingOn a pond at the edge of the wood.”And there they are, the skating children, and grownups, too, on blue rectangles of ice from which the snow has been dusted away in Hunters in the Snow, which hangs nearby in the grand galleries of this museum. More children jump, skip and balance on barrels in his epic street scene Children’s Games. Next to that, a town square goes crazy as masked revellers, a woman frying pancakes and hosts of paupers, actors and nuns throng around the jousting figures of Carnival and Lent. Carnival is a fat man sitting on a beer barrel with a skewer laden with roasted meat for a lance. Thin, grey-faced Lent has a long wooden spade with meagre fish on it.Wherever you look in Bruegel’s art, another human marvel hits you. His paintings are worlds. Each one is abundant enough to look at for hours, and keep coming back to all your life. This is not an exhibition of some old master remote in time. Bruegel’s paintings have fascinated the modern world. Here is his sardonic masterpiece of the horrors of war, Dulle Griet, which inspired Bertolt Brecht’s play Mother Courage. Brecht wrote that “the great war painting Dulle Griet” portrays “The Fury defending her pathetic household goods with the sword. The world at the end of its tether.” Seeing this legendary masterpiece in the flesh for the first time, its horror and black humour burn. This war is hell. Peasant women are beating back armoured soldiers while demon pirates dance in the flames of a ravaged city. Through it all, Dulle Griet stalks with sword in hand protecting her sack of swag. Impervious to the nightmare that surrounds her, she thinks only of surviving and getting rich.Money also drives the artist, according to the closest thing to a self-portrait by Bruegel that survives. It depicts a keen-eyed artist at work while a myopic fan watches through thick spectacles over his shoulder. Bruegel has no complaints – for as the gullible connoisseur marvels at the painter’s genius he reaches for his coin-stuffed purse.Did Bruegel just do it all for the money? It’s a down-to-earth view of his profession that fits in with his earthy realism. This great exhibition gets us closer than ever to the grain of Bruegel’s art. It even has a detailed section on how he prepared the wooden panels on which he chose to paint although, by the second half of the 16th century when he worked, canvas was common. Hard oak surfaces help give his paintings their robust solid brightness. Bruegel’s drawings are the key to his art for they are so much more subtle that you might expect. His drawings of landscapes are full of sensitively observed leaves and tree bark, mountain slopes and distant castles. This eye for landscape is essential to his magic. It marks him out from Bosch, who helped inspire his most fantastic scenes. But where Bosch creates a dream world, Bruegel grounds his visions in ours.The winter trees in Hunters in the Snow are so real they seem to jut forward out of the painting. Yet Bruegel’s sense of landscape is not just a matter of detailed observation. To say all human life is in his art is also to say it’s a kind of globe. He came from Flanders, and Hunters in the Snow may seem a quintessentially north European scene – but Flanders is flat. Where did Bruegel find those jagged rocky peaks that stab into the iron sky? They are the Alps. He was a well-travelled man who made a journey – huge for his time – over the Alps into Italy, as far south as Sicily. His painting of the Bay of Naples is here, with Vesuvius belching smoke as sailing ships bounce on green waves.Bruegel’s paintings create a sprawling diorama of the world. Space unfurls and people proliferate. It is all so satisfying, but wherever you go, whoever you are, there’s only one destination. The Prado in Madrid has lent Bruegel’s Triumph of Death and on this evidence – the fullest anyone is ever likely to see – it is, in every sense, his ultimate masterpiece. People are shoved into giant coffins by armies of skeletons under a diseased sky. A knight draws his sword to fight death off, but the hordes of the lifeless are unrelenting. All must succumb to the bony onslaught. The end is coming, but we can make the best of things with beer, pancakes and the life-giving genius of Bruegel.• Bruegel is at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, from 2 October to 13 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ded8db8fc7be4844a04a554ef346c01664bce16/0_464_1900_1140/master/1900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=788095eb58b4f265dfe65b8001faa4db","title":"books to understand pace of life further reading","story":"From The Little Prince to a study of advertising, five books to explain why we’re moving so fast – and how to slow downIn the digital age, time is precious. Many technological innovations, from faster broadband to instant messaging, promise to make our lives easier and more efficient, saving time for the good stuff. Yet many of us feel more harried than ever. We vacillate between blaming technology for our time pressure and turning to it for the solution.Our fixation with optimising time recalls The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, whose eponymous hero arrives on Earth to find a merchant selling sophisticated pills intended to quench one’s thirst: take one each week and the need to drink disappears. “Why are you selling those?” the little prince asks. “Because it saves a lot of time,” replies the merchant. “Experts have worked it all out. You save 53 minutes a week.” “If I had 53 minutes to spend,” says the prince, “I would walk very slowly towards a spring of fresh water.”Clearly, the desire to save time isn’t new. A long-standing theme in social theory has been the sense that the pace of everyday life is accelerating. As early as 1900, in The Philosophy of Money, Georg Simmel describes how the speed of the modern metropolis gives rise to a new temporality. For him, the acceleration of city life is intricately bound up with the velocity of the circulation of money. His analysis of modern time-consciousness, as one involving immediacy, simultaneity and presentism, speaks directly to our own sense of living at a rapid pace.In Social Acceleration, Hartmut Rosa shows how constant connectivity – in a culture that prioritises hyper-productivity, speed and efficiency – does not save time. Just as creating more roads produces more traffic, so answering emails generates endless email traffic. The Silicon Valley gurus who designed these technologies then, without irony, seek temporal refuge by embracing mindfulness, via a new range of marketable apps. Or they go off the grid for the weekend: their Californian libertarian dreams now turnturn the wheels of today’s turbo capitalism.Tim Wu’s The Attention Merchants reveals how the campaign to capture and monetise our attention has shaped advertising. There is no precedent for how much time we now spend staring at screens, whether at work, leisure or for everything in between. Wu is right to focus on design: the expertise of the world’s best psychologists is being harnessed to keep us online. No wonder we find these platforms addictive – they are meant to be.Over the last decade, even economists have recognised that downtime is a significant measure of life satisfaction and wellbeing. As the political philosopher Julie Rose argues in Free Time, discretionary spare time is a basic resource – an all-purpose means to pursue one’s conception of the good, whatever it may be. And if the ability to choose how you allocate your time lies at the core of a positive notion of freedom, then it follows that a just society must guarantee all citizens their fair share of free time.Rather than read the plethora of self-help guides to time management, it is perhaps more advantageous to understand the pressure to maximise time. Saving time should not be venerated as an end in itself, nor taken as the ine doctrine of technological progress. Instead, as we learn from the little prince, the question should not always be how do we save time, but what do we want to save time for?•\u0026nbspPressed for Time: The Acceleration of Life in Digital Capitalism by Judy Wajcman is published by Chicago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/683b89c1fa197b06824035fa5b8ae0a64cc69e97/0_225_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e7686179027d8b03738342b58434659","title":"aldi sales exceed 10bn for first time in uk and ireland","story":"Aldi bagged more than 1 million new customers last year, helping push sales at the discount grocer through £10bn for the first time.Aldi confirmed on Monday that it plans to open 130 stores in the UK over the next two years, creating 5,000 jobs and taking it closer to its target of 1,000 stores by 2022.Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons have all been forced to cut prices and improve their cheapest own-label ranges in response to the rise in popularity of Aldi and rival Lidl, while Tesco recently opened its own discount chain, Jack’s.Aldi said its best-performing products included items from its Specially Selected premium range – which now generates annual sales of more than £1bn – while fruit and veg, fresh meat and fish, its mother and baby range and beers, wines and spirits also did well.Giles Hurley, the chief executive of Aldi UK and Ireland, said: “The revolution in British grocery shows no sign of slowing.”He added: “In 2020, Aldi will have been serving British shoppers for 30 years.

Put simply, there are going to be winners and losers: hotter places and colder places wetter places and drier places and, yes, places that disappear under the sea. But the reality is a bit more complicated. In particular, are sea levels going up or down? The answer seems clear when you consider that Antarctica has lost 3 trillion tonnes of ice in the last 25 years.Yet to understand what is going on we first have to recognise that the Earth isn’t solid. It started life as a ball of hot liquid about 4.5bn years ago and our planet has been cooling ever since. Right at the centre of the Earth is a solid core of metal made of iron and nickel at a temperature of approximately 5,000C. But this core is surrounded by an approximately 2,000km-thick ocean of molten metal, again mostly iron and nickel. Surrounding this is a layer of rock called the mantle that is between 500C to 900C, and at these red-hot temperatures the rock behaves like a solid over short periods of time (seconds, hours, and days) but like a liquid over longer time periods (months to years) – so the rock flows, even though it is not molten. On top of the fluid mantle floats the crust, which is like the skin of the Earth. It is a relatively thin layer of cool rock that is between 30 to 100km thick and contains all the mountains, forests, rivers, seas, continents – our world.Since the crust is floating on the fluid mantle, if you increase its weight by, for instance, building up kilometres of ice on top of it, then it sinks further into the mantle. This is what has happened to the landmasses of Antarctica and Greenland, which are both covered in 2km to 3km of thick ice. If global warming were to cause all that ice to melt, then the sea level of the oceans would rise by more than 50 metres, submerging all the coastal cities of the world and making hundreds of millions of people homeless. This seems obvious. What is less obvious is how it might unfold.If the whole ice sheet covering Antarctica melts, the release of its weight will destress the rocks below, which, because they float on the mantle, will bob up. This is called post-glacial rebound. The position with Greenland is similar: the crust below it is being weighed down by the 3 million trillion litres of water held in the ice sheet, and if that ice sheet all melts then parts of the North American tectonic landmass will rise up. If the resulting increase in the height of the continent is bigger than the sea level rise, then major flooding may be avoided. Working out which scenario is more likely is vitally important for future generations, because one of these results will start to play out if global warming intensifies.What we know is this: the global mean sea level has risen 20cm since the beginning of the 20th century. Some of this has been owing to the water thermally expanding as the oceans have got hotter – since hotter liquids take up more volume (this is how liquid thermometers work). Some of the rise in sea level has been due to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets melting, and some due to other glaciers melting. The rising sea levels are global: they affect everyone with a coastline, from tiny Pacific islands that would be entirely submerged to a huge country such as Bangladesh, for which a one-metre rise in sea levels would result in nearly a fifth of the country being submerged and 30 million people being displaced. But while rising sea levels affect everyone, the post-glacial rebound affects only the coasts connected to parts of the Earth’s crust weighed down by the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.It is hard to overestimate the importance of this issue, and we badly need more data and scientific understanding of these liquid processes. A limited number of specialised satellites, such as CryoSat, GRACE and ICESat-2 – just launched by Nasa – are being used to monitor ice thickness and to develop models of post-glacial rebound. What the science predicts is that if the ice melts first in the northern hemisphere, then Greenland may bounce up higher than the average sea level, as will parts of North America, and so sea levels there may initially go down. If the opposite happens, and the Antarctic ice melts before the Greenland ice sheet, then it is the southern tectonic plates that will bounce up first and the whole of North America’s eastern coast will go under water first. The big unknowns are how quick the ice will go in each location, and how fast the post-glacial rebound will be.We need to get a better understanding of these processes fast, because if we don’t it may be too late to avert catastrophe. These issues don’t dominate news agendas but they should. Recently the French environment minister resigned, citing the president’s lack of progress and urgency on climate change issues. In doing so, he voiced the concern of the whole scientific community about world leaders – we need a step change in governmental action. But there’s the rub: not all governments feel urgent about it. And why? Perhaps it’s because, as the issue of post-glacial rebound shows, there will be winners and losers from global warming. For instance, countries such as Russia will be less affected by sea level rises, and may benefit from a more temperate climate. In contrast, the US may not only suffer from new drought zones, but its low-lying eastern coast is threatened by the accelerating loss of Antarctic ice. As the 21st century continues and the ice continues to melt, it will become clearer which countries have a greater incentive to mitigate climate change, and the resulting geopolitics has the potential to drive ision and conflict.• Mark Miodownik is the author of Liquid: The Delightful and Dangerous Substances That Flow Through Our Lives, which is short-listed for the Royal Society Book prize"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23137aca0de1ddfa408955234edf165d606aaa4a/822_2603_4077_2445/master/4077.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a4e56fc6aa3bd630e1a8ee1a98443ab","title":"matilda roald dahl 30 quentin blake","story":"Quentin Blake’s depictions of Matilda as an explorer and astrophysicist highlight how slow progress is in the real worldQuentin Blake’s new illustrations for the covers of Matilda, celebrating 30 years of the book, provoke a mixture of emotions, simultaneously empowering and bittersweet. On the one hand, it is glorious to see Matilda at 30, taking on the role of explorer, astrophysicist, or running the British Library. We need to see that happening. It makes us all reflect on what an intelligent, imaginative and industrious girl ought to be able to be. So why is it also just a tiny bit unsettling? Why does a part of us not want to know what Matilda has become? Somewhere in our heart of hearts we never want Matilda to grow up – we want her to be like Peter Pan, eternally young.For one of the most exciting things about Matilda as a character is that she can obstinately think and imagine her way out of impossible situations, a peculiarly child-like characteristic, and perhaps we worry that if she grows up she might lose that magic.And this reflects a tension inherent in all children’s books, which are almost always about growing up. My How to Train Your Dragon books are narrated by Hiccup as an old man looking back on his childhood, just as all adults reading children’s books aloud with their child are carried back into remembering what it is to want magic to shoot out of your fingers, to push at the back of a cupboard and find Narnia behind it, to look once again through the cool, clear eyes of a child, when a belief in the impossible is as natural as breathing. This is on the one hand exhilarating, going back to a time when all options are open, even the impossible ones, but at the same time a little melancholy, for the adult is looking back with experience. They know how the story ends, for them, at any rate, and for their generation.Looking at those Matilda covers makes us question how far we have come as a society in 30 years. That’s where the bittersweet part comes in. Not far enough.When I was a child, Matilda had not been written yet (I’d have loved her when I was nine) but I clung on hard to heroes like her. Pippi Longstocking, Meg in A Wrinkle in Time, the unnamed but powerful and headstrong girl in The Magic Finger, a Roald Dahl story that was a precursor to Matilda. I clung on because there simply weren’t enough strong girl heroes out there for me, in books or in films, or in real life. I was frustrated by the fact that there was no Jane Bond, no female head of a major company, so few women in the Houses of Parliament. But in my Matilda-like, hopeful, ebullient way, I assumed that the future we were travelling towards would be very different from the present.Now that I’m actually living in that future I have to say the rate of travel has been considerably slower than I expected. The recent photograph of Theresa May creeping behind the massed backs of the suited men of the EU is for me poignant because it is a vivid illustration of how things have not changed as quickly or as radically as that long lost nine-year-old so confidently hoped.We do have far more female heroes in children’s books who dynamically direct the action rather than passively letting it happen to them: Ruby Redfort, Katniss in The Hunger Games, Feo in The Wolf Wilder. In my new book Wizards of Once: Twice Magic, the girl hero, Wish, is the one with the truly great magical powers. My books are read by equal numbers of boys and girls and every time a nine-year-old boy in my signing queue says that his favourite character in my books is a girl, I do an internal high five. Yes! Progress is being made.Adults can learn from children’s lack of prejudice. We can learn from their hopefulness, their endless questioning, and their belief in the impossible. Children are the most creative people in the world, because they don’t know the rules yet. And we’re going to need every single ounce of that creative intelligence to come up with solutions to our current political and scientific challenges. What with one thing and another, the grown-ups have made a gigantic howling mess of things.So go, Matilda, go! Be an inventor, be an explorer, be a brilliant politician (we really, really need one). But stay young, stay obstinate and, for goodness’ sake, stay magic. We need your bravery and your brains and your bright eternal youth.• Cressida Cowell is the author of The Wizards of Once: Twice Magic"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1490370470c71f2c135b5bc6a485e647a206347/0_54_4368_2620/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cb2086e10566891a6eadc797abf0e29","title":"metoo movement climate change social norms swift profound","story":"After smoking and drink-driving, could climate change provide the next big behaviour-change challenge? The latest science tells us that nothing short of rapid, transformative change in our infrastructure and behaviour can prevent the loss of the climate we depend on – yet the message is only now being officially endorsed at the highest scientific level, because the implications are terrifying for today’s political and economic gatekeepers. It means real change, which incumbents always fear.But are we better at society-wide changes in attitude and behaviour than we give ourselves credit for? And do recent cultural shifts relating to everything from diet to plastics, sexism and attitudes to gender and identity suggest that we might be entering a phase in which more rapid behavioural changes are possible? Research in a new report for a soon-to-be launched international alliance of concerned groups suggests so.The really big behaviour changes need to be seen first and most among the populations of the high-consuming, wealthier countries. In recent decades most of these have built up experience of how to achieve behaviour change by tackling several public health crises.Dangerous driving and drink-driving is another example. Car use in the UK was 20 times higher in 2016 compared with 1949, but the risk of being injured or killed fell almost every year from 1949, from 165 deaths for every billion miles driven, to only 5.4 such deaths in 2015. To achieve that change meant challenging people’s perceptions of risk about their own behaviour, raising awareness of the resulting harm to self and others, persuading people to leave their cars at home and take different forms of transport if they planned to drink, and changes to vehicles themselves and the physical driving environment.Other examples of successful behaviour change can be found in responses to the HIVAids crisis, the dangers of an unhealthy diet and antibiotic resistance.These examples all provide grounds for hope – but there are signs that something else is happening that might bring even faster shifts in attitude and behaviour closer to what is needed to meet vital climate targets. A mixture of new social movements and social media now seem capable of transforming gradual background shifts into defining moments of change.They reveal that while change can take decades, these days new social norms can become established almost overnight. From the shift around single-use plastics, to the #MeToo movement and the rise of the vegan diet, things are moving fast. The male-only charity fundraiser went out of business following a single investigative report by the Financial Times into the Presidents Club scandal. Likewise, the tide turned rapidly against male-only conference panels once they began to be named and shamed online.Things change. It’s the one thing that is reliable. The climate is changing faster than the attitudes and behaviour of the people most responsible for causing its disruption – but we now know enough to speed things up if we choose to.After a summer of lethal, extreme weather events, it is also becoming clear that disruption of the climate is a public health issue on a much grander scale than smoking or drink-driving.Rapid shifts in how we live, work and run the economy have to be made. We should be optimistic that changing our behaviour – to the extent required – is possible.• Andrew Simms is an author, analyst and campaigner.

He talks about fatherhood, family and trying to deliver genuinely groundbreaking performances Nicolas Cage is the greatest American actor working today, full stop. Not very long ago, such a claim would have got you laughed out of the room. Only Cage superfans said such things in the eyes of the rest of the world, well, sure, he could act – he did win the 1996 Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas, after all – but he was too eccentric, too laughably over the top, just too damn Cage-y to be taken seriously.Ever since I saw him in his 1980s comedies – Peggy Sue Got Married, Moonstruck and Raising Arizona – in which he played, respectively, a nasal-voiced teddy boy, an opera-loving baker and a cartoonish ex-con – I have been a Cage superfan. I had never seen anyone act like him before – wildly mannered but always heartfelt – and there was something about his fearless lurch towards the ridiculous to achieve something unique, and maybe even glorious, that struck me as inspiring. If actors were pop songs, Cage would be Bohemian Rhapsody. As a shy 10-year-old, I would practise his grandiose speeches and even more grandiose gestures from Moonstruck in front of the mirror: “I ain’t no freaking monument to justice!” I would shout, lifting my arm to the sky. It felt exciting. But thanks to the endless schlocky horror movies he makes these days, coupled with all those internet supercuts compiling his notorious “Cage Rage” freak-outs from various movies (“Nicolas Cage’s Cagiest Moments!”), he is too often regarded as, if not exactly a guilty pleasure, then at least an ironic one. And it is hard to argue the genius of a man who fills his CV with movies such as Season of the Witch and Ghost Rider.But attitudes have been shifting. Ever since his magnetic performance in Werner Herzog’s Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans in 2009, re-evaluations have been written with headlines like Is Nicolas Cage Actually the Most Brilliant Actor of Our Time?, by journalists presumably too young to remember that Cage long ago confirmed this in movies such as David Lynch’s Wild at Heart. In a 2013 Reddit Ask Me Anything, Ethan Hawke confirmed that he, too, is a Cage superfan: “He’s the only actor since Marlon Brando that’s actually done anything new with the art of acting he’s successfully taken us away from an obsession with naturalism into a kind of presentation style of acting that I imagine was popular with the old troubadors.”Cage and I meet on a sunny day in the restaurant of the Savoy Hotel in London. He is dressed formally in a grey suit and tie, but his face is friendly. “What’s with all this SUN? I was hoping for London fog and GLOOM,” he says in his distinctive, lilting voice. These days Cage lives in “well, the ROMANTIC way to put it would be the Mojave desert, but the CRUDE way of saying it is I live in Las Vegas”. He moved there a decade ago for, he quietly admits, the rather crude reason of Nevada not having any state tax, “which was helpful at the time”.Cage famously blew the fortune he made in 90s blockbusters The Rock, FaceOff and Con Air on, among other things, some fabulously eccentric real estate purchases around the world, including a castle in Somerset. The castle has since been sold but he still has a cottage near Glastonbury, having been urged to check out the town by someone he describes as “my philosophy teacher”.“She thought there was something very ARTHURIAN about me – why, I don’t know – and I went and I fell in love with the place. Glastonbury town is like walking into a pack of TAROT cards: on the one side you have very ancient Christianity, on the other side you have pagan book stores, and someone’s barking about God in the middle of the street. It’s like an Ingmar BERGMAN movie, and I love it,” he says.He has two chunky rings on his fingers: a block of Tanzanite from Somerset and a tiger from Vegas, “So I always have Glastonbury and Las Vegas with me,” he says, smiling fondly at this hand.We are here today to talk about his latest film, Mandy, directed by Panos Cosmatos, and if your impression of Cage these days is of someone who squanders his talent in niche horror movies most people won’t see, well, Mandy will not change your mind. Cage is incredibly watchable as the devastated lumberjack, Red, who sets out to avenge the death of his girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough) at the hands of a cult leader (Linus Roache). But Adaptation it is not. Does he do these smaller movies because they give him the space to experiment with his, shall we say, unique style of acting?“Absolutely. I like to break forms, try different things, and I don’t think studios are comfortable with that. But in an independently spirited film, I can do that. Also, if I don’t have somewhere to go in the morning and a job to do, it can be very self-destructive. Then I’m just going to sit and order two bottles of red wine and dissolve, and I don’t want to be that person, so I have to work,” he says. After this interview, he says, he has to learn lines for three upcoming films.Perhaps it is this work ethic that has kept him so healthy. Unlike most other actors who have been around for four decades, and despite his reputation as a man of extremes, there have never been any substance-abuse scandals or allegations of burnout.“I certainly have a work ethic, that I will say. I’m the first to arrive and the last to leave. But also I think my children are to thank for that. When you’re a father, you can’t behave like that,” he says. Cage has two sons: Weston, 27, from an early relationship and 13-year-old Kal-El (the name Superman was given as a baby), from his third marriage to Alice Kim.Because of his son’s name, I tell him, there’s an online campaign to make him the next Superman. “Oh, I think my Superman days are long gone,” he laughs with a little pat of his belly. He would be an amazing villain in it, I reply. His eyes light up. “Oh, that would be GREAT! I’d make a great Lex Luther!”For all its hilariously over-the-top gore, Mandy is really about a man’s grief at the loss of the love of his life, and right before the film started shooting, Cage’s 14-year marriage to Kim came to a sudden end.“It was a shocker for me – I definitely didn’t see it coming, and those feelings had to go somewhere, so they went into the performance,” he says.Have he and Kim managed to stay friends? “Oh yes, I want to. She was quite young when I married her and I don’t really have any ill will towards what happened. That’s all I’ll say,” he says, looking genuinely stricken. “And now it’s like, wow, I’m 54 and I’m single again – I didn’t see that coming! It’s pretty grim.”Presumably he can’t really do Tinder. “No, definitely not. I’m not on social media, but everyone else is so I’m like, well, what do I do?”His moves might also need some work. When a female friend was over at his place recently, he showed her Vampire’s Kiss, his too-little-known 80s horror gem about a man who believes a one-night stand has turned him into a vampire.“I think it scared her. She left,” he says, laughing. It’s not really a great date movie. “No, maybe not!”It is often said that Cage doesn’t look like a movie star, but he actually does look like lots of movie stars, just from different eras: he has the long face and nose of Max Schreck in 1922’s Nosferatu, the high forehead of Werner Krauss in 1920’s The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, and the wild, bug eyes of Klaus Kinski. These are the very actors Cage always wanted to be like, having grown up watching them with his beloved father, Augustus Coppola, who made sure his son was grounded in the classics. He tries to bring the lessons he learned from those films into his own movies even the hand gestures from Moonstruck that I used to copy were a reference to Fritz Lang’s polis. That might sound laughably pretentious, but there is something refreshing about someone from the American film industry who doesn’t think film history means only Frank Capra movies or, a la Tarantino, old Jackie Chan or roadhouse films. “It’s true, I’m a throwback,” Cage nods.Does he fear looking ridiculous?“All I care about is the transformation so I never think: ‘Is this ridiculous?’ Even though” – he laughs – “sometimes it is!”Cage’s various attempts to explain his acting style, using terms such as “German expressionist”, “western kabuki” and, my personal favourite, “nouveau shamanic”, haven’t done much to dispel the impression he is, at the very least, a little bananas. But today he talks about it with relative straightforwardness.“I can do photorealism, but I wanted to let it be known that acting can break forms and hark back to something else. I’m a big fan of artistic synchronicity, when you do one form in another, like Munch’s Scream in Ghostrider,” he says, pulling the aforementioned face. “Not natural but truthful, not crazy for craziness’s sake.”They didn’t at the beginning though, so how on earth did he convince his early directors to let him try things that look so, well, weird?“I was lucky. I had people who went along with me for the ride and, indeed, sculpted it with me,” he says. This is possibly not how the film-makers themselves saw it: the Coen brothers were so unsure about him, they made him audition for Raising Arizona 20 times, and he was nearly fired from Moonstruck when he initially insisted on bringing in Jean Cocteau references. As for Peggy Sue Got Married, he admits: “I was lucky my uncle was directing it,” his uncle being Francis Ford Coppola.Nicolas Coppola grew up in Long Beach, California, the son of Francis Ford Coppola’s brother, and from an early age, he idolised his uncle.“I was in awe of him and wanted his approval. I loved the way he lived his life, always listening to the Beatles and playing guitar,” he says.But when Cage started acting as a teenager, he quickly realised he would have to change his surname to avoid charges of nepotism.“Certain actors, whose names I won’t mention, would stand outside my trailer and say: ‘I love the smell of Nicolas in the morning!’ I thought, I don’t need this. So I changed it and I was free.”Whereas he changed his surname to get distance from his family, his then close friend Charlie Sheen – born Carlos Estevez – changed his surname to his father Martin Sheen’s stage name. Didn’t he think that was weird?“I did think about that, yeah. That is kind of amazing, isn’t it? Charlie is a great actor – he stole the whole of Ferris Bueller in a two-minute scene. He is somebody I always admired but I thought it fascinating that he took his father’s surname and his brother Emilio stuck with Estevez. Well, it certainly worked for Charlie!”Two of Cage’s three ex-wives also come from famous families: Patricia Arquette, with whom he co-starred in Scorsese’s Bringing Out the Dead, and Lisa Marie Presley.“I think I felt a connection there, an understanding of the pressure of having a famous name. One of the things Lisa loved about me was that I changed my name – she thought that was the coolest thing. But I don’t really count those two marriages, I don’t think they belong on my record. The real marriage for me was the 14 years I had with Alice and the child we have together,” he says.Did Presley not find it strange that, before they married, Cage had dressed as her father onscreen twice, in Wild at Heart and Honeymoon in Vegas?“Oh no, I think Lisa really dug it! She liked Wild at Heart so much that she wanted to do a sequel. Maybe one day.”Cage and Presley are still friends, but he and Arquette haven’t talked “in a long time”. I ask if he thinks maybe the emotional extremes he goes to in his day job make it hard to have a relationship.“Maybe. I hadn’t really thought of it like that. But it’s true, you have to shut it off when you go home and I have a life – well, had a life ...” He still has a life, I say. “Well, I meant when I was married, coming home to that at night. But, yes, maybe it’s hard for people to be around.”It can’t have been easy turning off Charlie Kaufman every night, I say, referring to his performance as the neurotic, sexually frustrated screenwriter in Adaptation.“No! God! And I was married to Lisa then …” he trails off again.Cage’s career has gone from 80s comedies to 90s action movies to 21st-century horror, with oddball classics like Wild at Heart and Bad Lieutenant sprinkled among them. Yet what has been consistent is that Cage himself has been seen as one of Hollywood’s last eccentrics. And yet in person he comes across as surprisingly uneccentric. In fact he seems – “Boring, right?” No! “No, I really am,” he says, and he looks so anxious again that I want to hug him.Our time is almost up and as we prepare to leave, I hear myself saying: “I used to perform one of your soliloquies from Moonstruck when I was a kid.”“Well, I would like to see that!” he says, suddenly smiling again, leaning back in his chair.Two waiters are hovering. So is the movie PR. People from the tables next to us are starting to stare.“Go on,” he says, waving my self-consciousness away like it was a mere fruitfly. And so, gathering together all the lessons I’ve learned from Cage over the years, I do it.“I ain’t no freaking monument to justice!” I shout in the middle of the Savoy hotel, and I go on to perform the whole damn speech. Halfway through, he joins in with me.“You brought it BACK to me! That was FANTASTIC!” he says, applauding when we finally finish.I stammer apologies for my terrible acting, but he shakes his head. “No, that was GREAT. You really COMMITTED. Yes!”Mandy is released on 12 October• This article was corrected on 1 October 2018.

At the end of an eventful week during which Mourinho told Pogba that he would never captain United again and shared a frosty exchange with the £89m midfielder during training, it felt like a time to close ranks.Yet it was impossible to read Pogba’s demeanour as a show of support for his manager. His quip about signing his own death warrant served only to underline the discord at United. They are a mess at the moment and after making it clear that no player can ever be bigger than the club last week, Mourinho sent out another message by substituting Pogba in the 70th minute of the 3-1 defeat against West Ham on Saturday.Any watching Barcelona scouts would not have been impressed with Pogba’s latest lacklustre display. Mourinho is entitled to argue that the 25-year-old should look at himself before analysing United’s tactics again. Yet while Pogba is not playing like a world champion, his performances are part of a wider malaise at Old Trafford.It was Mourinho, after all, who set the tone with his grumbling during the season. No manager can criticise his players in public with such grinding regularity and hope to get away with it. Yet it was Mourinho who hung Phil Jones and Eric Bailly out to dry after the Carabao Cup defeat against Derby County last week and the Portuguese who questioned his team’s mentality against West Ham.United have no plans to get rid of Mourinho, and certainly not ahead of Tuesday’s Champions League visit of Valencia, but the negativity is undeniably draining.United tried to haul themselves back in the game after Felipe Anderson’s early goal for West Ham but their football was beige. Manuel Pellegrini’s side were rarely in trouble and doubled their lead when Andriy Yarmolenko’s shot looped in off Victor Lindelof in the 43rd minute.Mourinho had dropped Alexis Sánchez and Jesse Lingard from the squad and picked Scott McTominay on the right of a back three. Yet United, who must improve against Valencia, were confused and laborious in their 3-5-2 system. Marcus Rashford halved the deficit after replacing Lindelof but Marko Arnautovic killed off Mourinho’s side in the 74th minute.“If you want the truth I think it was honestly horrendous,” Luke Shaw said. “We didn’t look like a team today that was going to beat West Ham. I think inidually and as a team we were awful. That’s not good enough. It’s hard to take and we’re sorry to the fans for what they saw today. It was not good enough from a Man United team with all the talent we have.“From the first minute you could see we weren’t winning the second balls and our duels. It’s hard to take. Games like this, we should be dominating, creating chances, showing people why we deserve to play for Man United and that didn’t happen today. It was very poor from us.“We have to look at ourselves as players. We’re the ones who go on the pitch. The manager isn’t on the pitch, is he? He’s there to put a team out that he thinks can win the game. We had a very strong team. No excuses. As players we weren’t good enough.”For all that inidual quality, United find themselves in 10th place after seven games. They are nine points behind Manchester City and Liverpool, seven behind Chelsea and five behind Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur. They are below Bournemouth on goal difference and closer to the relegation zone than first place. Perhaps there is nothing left for Pogba to say."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b06b78e7cc9c47c182701907234ee93472ddbe43/0_223_3972_2383/master/3972.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb2c62416eded852117f3cf0b311ebea","title":"juventus in daunting form as ronaldo turns provider against napoli","story":"The record signing rediscovered some old wing wizardry as the champions won 3-1 amid their best start to a season since 1930Little did he know the Portuguese would join him at Juventus. A lot can change in four years, but the victory they shared over Napoli on Saturday suggested Allegri’s assessment might be as valid as ever.Juventus did not technically get a two-goal head-start. They were 1-0 down after 10 minutes. But Ronaldo was the common factor in all three goals the champions scored in response as they swept away last season’s runners-up, and the only team that had threatened to keep up with them so far in 2018-19.First came his cross for Mario Mandzukic’s equalising header. Tuttosport would quip, with customary understatement, that the ball was so good Unesco had assigned it “world heritage” status. It was the sort of old-fashioned wing play Ronaldo was supposed to have abandoned in this latter chapter of his career, turning Elseid Hysaj inside out to make space for the delivery.His intentions on the next two goals were less selfless. A shot drilled towards the bottom corner was pushed on to the post by David Ospina, before Mandzukic poked home the rebound. Finally, Leonardo Bonucci slid in to convert a corner from close range after Ronaldo glanced the ball on in the middle.Officially, he finished with two assists. You could argue he only meant one of them, yet it was still his unnatural leaping ability that made the final goal possible, getting his head to a ball that would have sailed over most others.In any case, the numbers understate his contribution. This was Ronaldo’s best game in a Juventus shirt, a constant menace on the left of attack. His presence alone was enough to drag Napoli’s midfield backwards, breaking the press they had applied so effectively early on.It was by harrying Juventus’s defenders that they took the lead, forcing Bonucci into a bad pass that was intercepted by Allan and funnelled quickly to José Callejón, who squared it to Dries Mertens for a simple finish. Napoli, for 20 minutes, were spell-binding, and might have been ahead sooner had Piotr Zielinski’s shot not drifted on to the upright.Even as Juventus took control, the Partenopei still had their moments. At 2-1, Alex Sandro was forced to scramble off the line with Callejón in close attendance. Minutes later, the Spaniard went clean through only to be thwarted by Wojciech Szczęsny. Were it not for Mario Rui’s red card, perhaps the last act of this game would have played out differently.And yet by full-time it was not just the scoreline that felt bleak for Napoli. They had done so much right, Carlo Ancelotti’s fluid 4-4-2 seeming to flummox the Bianconeri early on, but what does it matter when your opponent can just give the ball to the five-time Ballon d’Or winner? “You cannot escape it,” wrote Luigi Garlando in La Gazzetta Sportiva. “Talent is a rich club’s caviar, tactics are the bread of the poor.”The numbers are daunting. Juventus have now won all eight games they have played across all competitions, the club’s best start since 1930. Their six-point lead atop Serie A is the biggest any team has ever enjoyed this early in a campaign.Is it all over already? Not according to either manager. Ancelotti argued this game had only reinforced his belief this team could compete, and that greater courage in key moments could have made the difference. Allegri said it was time for his players to “shut up and work”.Quietly, though, he had to be more satisfied than he was letting on. Ronaldo’s star turn did not happen in isolation, but because he is becoming better integrated into this team. His developing rapport with Mandzukic has been noted. There has always been professional respect between players with a shared habit for showing up in the biggest games, but increasingly they understand each other’s movements as well.Ronaldo, furthermore, showed he was willing to put himself at the service of the team, rather than expecting everyone else to work for him. The drive for personal achievement remains, but there was nothing insincere about his celebration when Bonucci bundled the third goal in.A murkier note for Juventus, indeed, came off the pitch. During a post-game interview on Sky Sports, the club’s CEO Beppe Marotta revealed he will be leaving. Even now, the reasons for this decision remain unclear. Marotta has made it clear this was the club’s desire more than his own but that, as a “company man”, he accepted it. Why would Juventus want to part ways, though, with a director widely credited as playing a fundamental role in their return to the forefront of not just the domestic game but European football as well?Hired in late 2010, Marotta oversaw the construction of Antonio Conte’s first title winners and all the iterations since, bringing the likes of Andrea Pirlo, Paul Pogba and Paulo Dybala to the club, not to mention Allegri. It is rumoured he and the team’s president, Andrea Agnelli, clashed over the Ronaldo signing – in which he took a back seat to sporting director Fabio Paratici – but officially Juventus simply want to freshen things up.Last Monday, Marotta had won recognition as the ‘best executive’ in the game at the World Football Summit. Games, as Allegri notes, are won by players. Long-term success, unromantic as it might be, is still built on decisions made in boardrooms.• A week ago, James Pallotta was “disgusted” as Roma lost to Bologna. How different the world looks already after the Giallorossi followed up a 4-0 rout of Frosinone with a 3-1 derby win over Lazio. Fate played its hand – Javier Pastore was poor before getting injured and replaced by Lorenzo Pellegrini, who duly scored a Pastore-esque backheel – and the frailty of this side was still highlighted by the goal Federico Fazio gave away. But there was also a defiance and combativeness that had been missing so far. And having Aleskandar Kolarov on free-kick duty doesn’t hurt, either.• For once, Milan built a lead too big to throw away. Four goals from outside the 18-yard-box – something they had not done, according to Gazzetta, since such stats started being tracked full-time in 2004 – at Sassuolo were perhaps a fitting way to win a game which they started with an abundance of attacking players but no actual striker. Suso breaking a duck that had endured 1,728 minutes was also a relief.• Gervinho, by contrast, is averaging one every 101 minutes for Parma. What year is this again?• Still not as good as Krzysztof Piatek, who scored both goals in Genoa’s win over Frosinone and now has eight in six games. Ronaldo has some catching up to do in the running to become capocannoniere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17206a9b71ecf64d66b11c2060fd4b191f7840a7/0_0_3500_2122/master/3500.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=52b38e4a5db168b2afa0ec2b259dd5e0 1440w","title":"nine simple ways to revamp your workspace for a healthier environment","story":"Improving your posture at work, adding some greenery to your desk and moving to a window seat are just some of the quick fixes that can transform your productivityThere’s a lot more to happiness in the workplace than a comfortable salary. In fact, working more than 40 hours a week may well be doing you a considerable disservice and directly affecting your health and performance at work. Thankfully, taking a few minutes of your day and deploying intelligent fixes can turn your office from a dreary workspace to an area that transforms your productivity and mindset. Here are nine ways you can make your office work for you.Take a standThere’s a reason standing desks – no longer the reserve of agile Silicon Roundabout startups – are quickly making their way into the offices of multinationals. Encouraging employees to be considerably more aware of their posture at work, adjustable desks and workstations such as Varidesk and the Yo-Yo desk are quickly becoming adopted by offices across the UK. What’s more, sitting for more than six hours a day leaves you at greater risk of anxiety and depression, according to the Association for Psychological Science – meaning that an eight-hour day spent on your rear quickly becomes an unhealthy habit.Spring cleaningOld meeting notes, dirty mugs, empty sandwich boxes and a dirty keyboard all add up to an unhappy desk. According to a study by Princeton Neuroscience Institute, “multiple visual stimuli” – also known as unwelcome desk clutter – compete for attention in your brain, meaning you can remove distraction with a desk free of unnecessary mess. Similarly, you’ll want to give your keyboard a wipe-down every week or so, as the average keyboard has 20,000 times more bacteria than a toilet seat.Stretch it outStressful experiences – at work and at home – have the potential to age the human brain by four years, according to a 2017 study presented at the Alzheimer’s Association’s conference. Thankfully, you can de-stress and fight poor posture at your desk by working through this stretching routine. To open up your back, bring your hands behind you and press your palms together. Bring your elbows back and downwards, slowly tucking your chin – hold the stretch for 30 seconds and repeat three times. Consider this your first step to become a more supple – and pain-free – human.Make a moveFor now, there are no stringent laws on taking screen breaks, but the Health and Safety Executive recommends a five- to 10-minute break every hour. Standing up and walking around will help stretch your body, adjust your posture and increase productivity and attention, as well as the quality of your work.Give yourself a handSpending 35-plus hours at a desk each week is hardly appealing, the very real prospect of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) – a condition in which a nerve in your wrist is under pressure, causing numb hands, weakness and tingling – is far worse. Common in men and women over 40 years old, CTS stems from repetitive actions such as using a mouse and keyboard. Handily, ergonomic office equipment – Microsoft Surface and Mac-friendly Kinesis Freestyle are two of the UK’s most popular options – can help stave CTS off. The oddly shaped equipment improves forearm posture, adds comfort and supports your hands. You’ll agree that it’ll be worth a few odd looks.Thirsty workWorkplace absence in the UK is costing £18bn annually, according to analysis from Centre of Economic and Business Research. That’s a total of 168m working days lost annually. While there’s no sole reason for this, it’s important to adopt everyday habits to keep you as healthy as possible in the workplace. Dehydration, for example, even at a mild level, directly affects both physical and mental performance, meaning that you’ll find it hard to concentrate during work hours and struggle with that post-work run. Women should aim for two litres a day, and men for three litres.Light workIf constantly feeling tired is making office life a miserable reality, it could be because of the light levels in your office. A 2013 study from the Netherlands found that when office workers were exposed to more daylight during the working week, they were less sleepy and considerably more energetic. Similarly, researchers from Turkey found that study participants who had three hours or more of daylight a day felt considerably happier and more satisfied – muting the chance of office burnout. Push for that window desk and reap the rewards immediately.Pain in the neckYour career, rather unfortunately, is wreaking havoc on your neck. A combination of poor posture and stress, which affects your sleep, is likely to be causing unnecessary neck pain. Rarely a sign of something more serious, neck pain can be treated with over-the-counter painkillers such as Voltarol, which can be taken orally or applied directly to the affected area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab1d3f401fabc0adb52318c10e7d568bb3abbd20/0_1722_4392_2635/master/4392.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=160f357b60bc5469730db8fe23d9956f","title":"seven ways to improve your reflexes","story":"Whether you want to be a star goalie or a tennis ace, the best advice is to practise. But eating spinach, playing videogames and catching coins you’ve thrown in the air could also help What exactly do you want to improve your reflexes for? If it’s for a specific sport, you’re off to a good start. Perhaps you want to be the star goalie at your Thursday afternoon five-a-side, or maybe you have taken up boxing and would prefer not to get hit in the face. The more specific an action, the better. Above all, the cliche holds good: practice makes perfect. Reflexes tend to be an involuntary response, so you need to develop your muscle memory and make those reactions second-nature. If you don’t put the work in, you won’t see any results.Your reaction time is always going to be slower if you’re too tense. Stiff muscles are slower to move. If you have just started sparring in a combat sport, the one tip you will get over and over again is to relax, which can be incredibly difficult when you’re starting out. The aim of the game is to stay relaxed, but alert. Perhaps that means taking some time out to meditate, focusing on your breathing or practising mindfulness – a 2010 study found meditation helped people to perform better in a reaction-timed task.Or at least, that’s according to researchers at Leiden University and the University of Amsterdam. They found subjects who had recently eaten tyrosine, which is found in spinach and eggs, performed better at a reaction-based task than those who hadn’t.Video games may help your reaction speed. A study by scientists from the University of Rochester found that action video games helped people to make the right decisions faster. They also developed a heightened sensitivity to their surroundings.You can use your spare pennies to help speed up those reflexes. Put your hand out with your palm facing the ground and put a coin on top of your knuckles. With your arm outstretched, throw the coin upwards and then try to catch it in the same hand. If that’s too easy, try adding more coins to up the ante.Another invaluable, and inexpensive, tool used to improve reflexes is the humble tennis ball. You can also use a six-sided ball called a reaction ball – although if you can’t find one of those, any bouncy ball will do. All you need is a surface to throw the ball against, with the aim being to catch the thing before it ricochets off into someone else’s back garden. You could also ask a friend to throw it at you while you practise dodging – it’s up to you whether or not you choose a friend with a grudge.A lack of sleep can have a huge effect on reflexes and split-second decision-making. Researchers in California found sleep-deprivation can make you almost as sluggish as a few alcoholic drinks, so make sure you get your eight hours a night."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/980436e5e9f1eea9c3624d34e54c245db1daf05b/0_1155_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f766009d19687900153f79ae0b11b42d","title":"easy feasting spanish spiced roast rack of pork","story":"Smoked paprika and aromatic fennel add fire and flavour to a roasted rack of pork that’s low on effort, high on impact and perfect for sharingOutdoor late summer gatherings don’t always have to mean firing up the barbecue.

The only way for its 3,600 residents and thousands of tourists to get hold of their money was to join the lengthy queue at the post office or via a single ATM which regularly ran out of bank notes. Those who needed an over-the-counter service had to make the six-mile commute to the nearest bank, in Axminster. Residents with no access to a car or online banking have been left stranded and even ice-cream sellers have been forced to invest in card-payment technology.“It’s caused real hardship,” says a spokesperson for the local ironmongers, Arthur Fordham. “If you didn’t accept card payments, you faced going out of business because customers couldn’t get cash, but card payments are more expensive to process.” A year on, the shop has agreed to host an ATM to get cash flowing through the town again, and the queues to use it often stretch down the street.Lyme Regis has become an involuntary forerunner of the cashless society. Nearly 3,000 bank branches have closed across the UK since 2015 and ATMs disappeared at a rate of 500 a month in the first half of this year, according to a survey by Which? – a sixfold increase since last November. More than 130 communities, many of them in poor areas, now have no ATM and the 2.7 million Britons who rely entirely on cash are being increasingly shut out of essential services.Cash is still the most popular form of payment in the UK, accounting for nearly half of all transactions. However, few of those who prefer plastic realise we are all footing an invisible bill for the convenience. Credit and debit card payments cost traders on average three times as much as cash because they have to pay a service charge to the bank that processes the payment. Part of that, the interchange fee, is passed to the card issuer and most of the rest, the scheme fee, goes to Visa or Mastercard.The EU capped interchange fees in 2015 and, this year, banned traders from recouping the cost through a surcharge on card transactions. However, Visa and Mastercard have erted the savings into their coffers by quietly doubling their scheme fees. Businesses now pay nearly £1bn a year more in these charges than in 2015 and small businesses, such as cafes and corner shops, are disproportionately hit.“The costs that come with processing card payments stifle small firms across the country,” says Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses. “If the war on cash is successful and card providers end up with a monopoly over the payments market, scheme fees may rise even more. Now that small firms are prohibited from directly passing on the costs of processing cards, some have no choice but to raise prices.”Last year, Visa announced plans to launch a cashless challenge in which small traders would be invited to explain the benefits of eliminating cash. The winners would receive a lump sum and free contactless technology. It has completed a similar initiative in the US. According to Cherry, it could cost those who accept the challenge dear. “Paying by cash makes life straightforward for small businesses and consumers alike, as they don’t have to worry about broadband speeds, transaction or interest charges, and they can keep a clear eye on what’s being spent,” he says. “Card payments mean reliance on a digital infrastructure which has been known to fail.”“Visa and Mastercard’s main objective isn’t to win ATM market share from Link, but to drive consumers away from cash by killing off ATMs,” says Mark Falcon, former director of regulation and strategy at the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) and founder of financial consultancy Zephyre. “This is because card payments generate much higher fees than cash and ATMs.”Visa and Mastercard claim their motives for eliminating cash are altruistic, since poor countries are disadvantaged by the costs of handling cash. It is the poor, however, who are paying the price of an increasingly cashless society.According to the Financial Inclusion Commission, 1.5 million adults in the UK do not have a bank account – some, like recently arrived immigrants, because they lack the paperwork to open one. More than half of the 2.7 million people who rely mainly on cash have a household income of less than £15,000. They are being increasingly penalised as the best deals for utilities, telecoms and even train tickets are only available online to cardholders, while universal credit will only be transferred to a bank or building society account, without the previous option of cash cheques redeemable at post offices. And whereas before the ban on card surcharges only customers who chose to pay with plastic bore the cost of the transaction, now the poorest and the unbanked have to share the bill.Last month, Europe’s central bankers warned that the mission to create cashless societies posed a grave risk to the financial system, as cyber attacks could paralyse digital-payment systems. IT failures could also shut down a nation’s finances. In June, a technical meltdown at Visa caused chaos across Europe as card payments failed.The PSR, which is responsible for regulating the ATM market, has been accused of inertia as pressure from big business leaves swathes of the UK without cash machines. It told the Observer it proposes to use its powers to oblige Link to maintain any ATM that is more than half a mile from its nearest neighbour, but has no plans to require the same commitment from Visa and Mastercard because their ATM scheme is far smaller. “We are aware that cash will continue to be an important method of payment for millions of people in the UK in the years to come,” says a PSR spokesperson. “That is why we are continuing to explore the long-term sustainable solutions to accessing cash.”However, Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury select committee, has declared that its intervention may be “too little, too late”.Visa says it subsidises interchange fees for ATMs in vulnerable areas and sees its role as giving “consumers a choice in how they pay”. Mastercard says that it is up to consumers to choose how they pay. “However, it’s our mission to provide consumers with simple, safe and secure ways to pay, which offer advantages over cash,” says a spokesperson.Inaction by the regulator has left the UK payments industry at the mercy of US monopolies, according to David Clarke, head of policy of campaign group Positive Money. He, along with the chief executives of prominent charities and unions, is lobbying for the PSR to be given a statutory duty to ensure access to cash, and a level playing field between rival ATM schemes.“Given a choice, millions of us will continue to use cash for decades to come, but Visa and Mastercard are determined to take that option away,” Clarke says. “Banks and card companies stand to make greater profits if cash disappears and their moves to slash funding for the cash network have seen machines close at an alarming pace. With cash gone, Visa and Mastercard’s stranglehold would intensify, leaving them free to hike charges on our day-to-day payments.”There are about 70,000 ATMs in the UK, but the number is decreasing rapidly. Analysis by consumer group Which? estimates that cash machines are closing at a rate of 300 a month.This rate of closure - which has accelerated since 2015 - has particularly hit rural communities where some of the most significant cuts have taken place.Which? and the Federation of Small Businesses have launched a Save Our Cashpoints campaign, calling for a review to fully evaluate the impact that the cuts will have on communities and on consumers’ ability to use cash payments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73bdd890897c2d101fb7e695c4bc4416a7aaf685/0_250_3750_2250/master/3750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8c4745cac3ac542d9d2a088c6791f06","title":"wait buy brexit house prices property","story":"I’m trying to buy a property in Oxfordshire but some friends say I should hold off on the dealQ I am trying to buy a property in Oxfordshire but some of my friends have advised me to postpone any purchase\u0026nbspbecause\u0026nbspof the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspSome people believe property prices will go up while others believe that prices will fall.

Girling, along with fellow MEP Richard Ashworth, voted last October for a European parliament resolution that the UK had not made sufficient progress in Brexit talks and should not start talks on trade with the EU.The vote was mostly symbolic, only six Tory MEPs were in the chamber, but when the result emerged, the response was swift. One Tory MP said the MEPs had behaved appallingly, while social media seethed with talk of “traitors” and “remoaners”. Girling and Ashworth lost the Tory whip and Theresa May told parliament she had taken action against “the two Conservative MEPs who voted against British interests”. Finally on Tuesday the two rebels were expelled.Girling says: “From a purely personal view it’s extremely upsetting … but I feel so strongly about this that I have had to take this route.”Her vote was never meant as a political statement, she says. “I thought it was fundamentally dishonest to pretend that negotiations have got to the point where negotiations can move to the next level.”After the June 2016 vote, Girling reluctantly supported the leave result that many of her constituents had voted for. But she was soon alienated when May embarked on a policy of leaving the EU customs union and single market – “the hardest possible Brexit”.A turning point was the 2016 party conference, where the prime minister declared that anyone who identified as a citizen of the world was a “citizen of nowhere”, which Girling describes as “that nasty speech”, and then a subsequent speech in which May set out her Brexit red lines. “When she first came out with these red lines I was really astonished,” says Girling, who had expected a softer Brexit to reflect the narrowness of the 52-48 result of the referendum.“I’ve been a member of the party for more than 40 years, and for 38 of those years the party has been pro-Europe. It’s had its difficulties,” she says, recalling John Major’s battles with the Maastricht rebels and David Cameron’s decision to pull out of the mainstream centre-right bloc in the European parliament, the EEP. “Then overnight Mrs May decided ‘we are all Brexiteers now’ and that just is a place I just can’t go.”Brexit has changed the party in other ways, Girling says, emboldening those opposed to tackling climate change Tory MEPs have also voted with Hungary’s ruling party in rejecting EU action to safeguard the rule of law. While there is no Conservative equivalent of Momentum, she predicts “a gradual clearing out of the more moderate conservatives”.Girling joined the Conservative party as a student, starting her career at the carmaker Ford in 1979, the year Margaret Thatcher came to power.Cameron ceded too much ground, she says, to the “the monster that is the Eurosceptic party … He got that completely wrong because the more you chuck them the more they grow.”Girling and Ashworth joined the EPP this year, a move encouraged by continental politicians keen to embrace the symbolism of the British returning to the fold.A fervent support of the people’s vote campaign, Girling thinks a second referendum is the only way to overturn Brexit. She believes the EU would accept an extension of article 50 if the UK was thinking again, but the difficulty is what happens if the UK seeks to stay in the EU beyond European elections in May 2019, requiring the election of British MEPs.In that case, the European elections in the UK could be “a proxy referendum on Britain’s EU membership”, she says, although she believes this is not the most likely scenario.For now, she thinks the prime minister has backed herself into a corner. While many EU diplomats hope May will have room to make compromises after the party conference, Girling is less convinced. “If Theresa May goes to the Conservative party conference and does a load of tub-thumping – which she will – that doesn’t actually free her up afterwards. It makes it worse,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/980448808f393a4252a44dd1874719d16a0de1b7/0_180_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13291c57956e3fca0cb7626876722a73","title":"tory conference brandon lewis avoids appgate amid party bid for young voters","story":"Tech mishap not mentioned by Conservative chair as the PM offers silence over spin A few dozen people with an average age of 55 gathered in a room to discuss how to win back the under 45s. Though not Matt Hancock, who was a no-show. A shame because he could have lowered the average age to 54. The health secretary is 39 going on 12. James Brokenshire also failed to attend a fringe event on dealing with disasters and emergencies. Not even the communities minister had an answer to the disaster that this year’s Tory party conference in Birmingham is shaping up to be. The best that anyone is hoping for this year is to come out alive.Even those who did turn up were rather regretting their decision. The business secretary, Greg Clark, had the best of it as no one heard a word he had to say because he was drowned out by whoops and cheers from next door for Ruth Davidson, the woman whom every Tory – Boris Johnson excepted – wishes was their leader.In a studio nearby, the prime minister – for the time being at any rate – was going through the latest in her ongoing series of private hells on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show. Normally the Sunday morning of a party conference is a chance for a party leader to come up with some positive spin and a policy announcement on the politics chat shows.Theresa May only had her silence to offer. Nothing to say on Windrush. Nothing to say on Brexit. Nothing to say about anything. She merely rolled herself into a foetal ball, her expression a hybrid of fury and glacial misery, and counted down the minutes to the end of the interview.It was left to Brandon Lewis to open proceedings in the main conference hall. After scraping the barrel with his achievements in holding on to Wandsworth in the local elections, Lewis declared: “Never did I believe I might stand up here as party chairman.” It was a feeling widely shared by everyone in the room, as he is a man who likes to keep his talents well hidden.It’s also a racing certainty that he won’t be party chairman by this time next year, as he was responsible for showing the government was leading the way in technological Brexit solutions by producing a conference app that listed the phone numbers of almost everyone in government. Fortunately, Chris Grayling had managed to provide the organisers with the wrong details, so he wasn’t compromised. Even the losers get lucky sometimes.For some reason, Lewis chose not to mention Appgate – probably hoping that there were plenty more far worse shitstorms yet to come and everyone would have forgotten about his by the end of the week – and instead concentrated on delivering a speech so dull, so devoid of content insight, that it would set the tone for the whole conference. An endeavour in which he was wholly successful.So much so that there were even fewer people in the hall than there otherwise might have been to hear Liam Fox declare that the big Brexit idend was to be found in selling dairy products to China. Blessed are the cheese-makers, for they shall inherit the earth. Even by his own standards, that was catatonically dim, but these days the international trade secretary will say almost anything to get some attention. His neediness is not attractive.Normally the speech from the defence secretary is one of the highlights of a Tory conference, but Gavin Williamson’s reputation precedes him. The more desperate he is to sound authoritative, the more he sounds like Private Pike. He is a man who oozes levitas, even when he has two awfully big announcements to make.The first was that he was going to name a new ship HMS Birmingham. The second was that he was going to set up a cadets’ cyber security training centre. This from a party that can’t even manage its own conference app. Even Private Pike had the grace to die a little at this point.The only speaker to stop the audience from flatlining wasn’t a politician. Or even a Tory. But Digby Jones, the former head of the CBI, is a fully paid-up Brexiter and he was there to tell everyone that Brexit was going to be fine. He didn’t know why and he didn’t know how, but no one was too concerned. They just wanted a glimmer of hope."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5da71a7b891bc660d21802d4b3e07461e5f0cd4/0_0_1263_758/master/1263.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=494757ebaf330dec468c09c8c6c9d709","title":"the nobel prize in physiology or medicine 2018 live","story":"Two immunologists, American James P Allison and Japanese Tasuku Honjo, win annual award for work on a new approach to cancer treatmentWhen I wrote, at the beginning of this blog, that I’d put my money on Allison, I sort of wish I really had put money on Allison. Here we go. The committee has arrived.Which I must say is infinitely more preferable to the music they used to play. Silence has well and truly fallen at the Karolinska Institute.The room is filling up for the announcement. It’s nearly time to see how far off we are with our predictions this year...The winners-to-be do not get any advance notice that they have bagged the prize. Here’s one recipient getting the call earlier today:How often do we get the Nobel prize right? Twice in history, I’d suggest. And those were easy ones: the physics prize in 2013 for what has become known as the Higgs boson and another physics prize, awarded last year, for the detection of gravitational waves. Why easy? Well, in both cases the key discovery came in the year before, and would have elicited a torrent of nominations in the run up to the following year’s Nobel deadline in January. With the Higgs boson, it was Cern’s announcement of the discovery of the particle in July 2012 that made Peter Higgs and Francois Englert a shoo-in. In the case of gravitational waves, it was the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo) team’s detection of a quiver in spacetime in February 2016. But back to medicine. Who’s in the running this year? I’ll take a punt on James Allison at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. He won the 2015 Lasker award - a good indicator of future Nobel fame - for demonstrating how the immune system can be unleashed on cancer. There are plenty more candidates though. How about William Kaelin (Harvard), Peter Ratcliffe (Oxford and the Francis Crick Institute), and Gregg Semenza (Johns Hopkins) for discovering how cells sense and adapt to changes in oxygen, a process essential for life? Or Stephen Elledge (Harvard) and Evelyn Witkin (Rutgers) for discovering how DNA protects itself from damage? The committee might plump for Crispr, a gene-editing procedure. Personally I think it’s too early: the tool has immense promise but has hardly transformed many people’s lives. And it may be more suited to the chemistry prize these days. There’s also the tricky problem of who to honour. At least four scientists have been key to Crispr’s development, namely Emmanuel Charpentier, Jennifer Doudna, George Church and Fang Zheng, and we all know what the Nobel committees think of numbers greater than three.The question gets asked every year, and not only by those who miss out on the prizes. Writing in the Observer, Robin McKie points out that Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society and joint winner of the 2009 chemistry Nobel, is critical of the awards in his book Gene Machine. The biologist argues that the awards have “increasingly become a lottery” and is part of a global awards system “beset by cronyism”. In the same article, Lord Rees, the astronomer royal, laments that only three sciences get Nobel awards. “Mathematics is ignored, as are computing, robotics and artificial intelligence as well as environmental sciences,” he says. Meanwhile Brian Keating, a cosmologist at the University of California, San Diego, takes on the “rule of three” - the maximum number of people named for a science prize. “Apart from leading to examples of scientific injustice, the rule of three reinforces the layperson’s impression that science is done by one or two lone geniuses – usually white males – working without vast support networks behind them,” he says.And let’s not forget how few women get these prizes. Of 214 medicine laureates, only 12 are women. The last female winner was Youyou Tu in 2015, and before that, May-Britt Moser in 2014. Incidentally, the situtation is far worse in physics, a field where a woman has not won the Nobel in 55 years.Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell, the British astrophysicist who was passed over for the 1974 physics Nobel after she discovered pulsars, maintains that not winning has meant a whole load more parties. Last month, she landed the special Breakthrough prize in fundamental physics, worth a Nobel-busting $3m (£2.3m). Bell, who is donating the whole pile to help students underrepresented in physics, told me:I feel I’ve done very well out of not getting a Nobel prize. If you get a Nobel prize you have this fantastic week and then nobody gives you anything else. If you don’t get a Nobel prize you get everything that moves. Almost every year there’s been some sort of party because I’ve got another award. That’s much more fun.The 2017 Nobel prize in medicine went to three US researchers for their decades-long effort to unravel the workings of the 24-hour body clock. Jeffrey Hall at the University of Maine, Michael Rosbash at Brandeis University, and Michael Young at the Rockefeller University, all witnessed first hand disruption to their circadian rhythms when they heard they’d won in 5am calls from Stockholm. In the words of Juleen Zierath of the Nobel academy, the scientists raised “awareness of the importance of a proper sleep hygiene.”It’s that time of year again. Over the coming days, a select few scientists will receive a phone call from Sweden, fear that it’s an elaborate spoof, overcome their disbelief, and finally accept that they have joined the elite club of Nobel laureates.The annual handout of the world’s top gongs kicks off today with the award of the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine from the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. It’s the kudos that matters of course, the recognition of work deemed worthy, but let’s not forget the 9 million Swedish krona (£775,000) that comes with each prize. It’s not what a millennial fashion blogger can earn on Instagram, of course, but what benefits, really, have scientists brought the world in discovering penicillin, HIV, and cancer-causing viruses in developing treatments for diphtheria, tuberculosis, yellow fever, and malaria in understanding the immune system, hormones, the nervous system, human blood groups, fundamentals of vision and hearing, and the structure of DNA by inventing MRI scanners, IVF and stem cell therapies?Today’s announcement of the medicine prize is due no earlier than 10.30am UK time. It will be followed by the physics prize on Tuesday and the chemistry prize on Wednesday, both from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences from 10.45am UK on the day. Do join us for live coverage!

However, officials at NHS England believe the figures could be used to show the policy is popular and that take-up will continue to grow as the public becomes more aware.The government has promised to ensure that people in every part of England will be able to see a GP from 8am to 8pm every day of the week as a key element of its push to create a “truly seven-day NHS” by the end of the current parliament. Under NHS guidance from earlier this year, Monday was set as a date by which CCGs were required to provide extended access to GP services.However, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) said it was “shocking” that so many appointments were going unused.Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard said: “GPs want to give patients access to services they need but this will differ depending on local demographics.“At a time when general practice is struggling for resources and patients are waiting longer for routine appointments, to find out so many evening and weekend appointments have been unfilled due to lack of demand is shocking.”Dr Richard Vautrey, the BMA GP committee chair, said: “Because it has become a political must-do, everybody is jumping. We understand there is huge pressure from the centre on CCGs to demonstrate they are providing a full seven-day service.“Sensible CCGs that want to use their resources in a better way are under pressure to maintain a service that really isn’t good value for money.”An NHS England spokesperson said: “Despite this small survey of a minority of the country, patients do actually want to be able to see a GP at convenient times, and that includes evenings and weekends.“To suggest that people should always be forced to take time off work if they need to see their GP would be a backward step, and as the popularity of new types of online digital primary care shows, patients are increasingly prepared to vote with their feet to get convenient access.”Pulse said it had estimates that at least £15m has been “wasted” on the total of 501,396 unused extended hours slots across the 80 CCGs that responded to FOIs. This was based on NHS England’s evaluation of the scheme’s pilot.A CCG spokesperson said: “We are working with our team to ensure there is a publicity campaign across east Kent prior to the national 1 October go-live date. Our expectation is that uptake will improve once awareness increases and will build with time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72ce4bca38734369bbd10aa4e3f1b3c70794e5c2/51_0_4529_2719/master/4529.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5943b62752c94cc492d93431a4001ca4","title":"bryony frost comeback newton abbot horse racing tips","story":"• Frost unafraid of return after stamping by horse • ‘A lot of people will be there, willing us on,’ says jockeyBryony Frost returns to action at Newton Abbot on Monday, three months after sustaining injuries in a fall at the Devon track that could have killed her.The 23-year-old, fired to prominence by a series of big-race successes last winter, was stamped on by a horse after what looked an innocuous tumble on 6 July, fracturing her sternum and causing an aneurysm in her pancreatic artery.“I could have been a cooked cookie if I’d ridden the next day and it had burst,” she reflected afterwards. But her medical advisers are now satisfied that she has made a complete recovery.“I’m prepared, I’m ready, my body feels as strong as it’s ever been. I’m excited, I’m pumped,” she said on Sunday. “It’s exciting to be back racing, especially at a local track. A lot of people will be there, willing us on.”Nor will Frost allow any space in her mind for the thought that this is the same course where she was injured. “Ah, you’re gonna have lots of tracks you’ve had falls at. That’s the name of the game. I’ve had falls there before, so it’s nothing new.“At the end of the day, my horse and riding him in races is worth any risk to me. It’s literally what I get up in the morning for. It’s what’s making my heart beat. There’s not a feeling in my life that matches the feeling when I’m with my horse and I get into that rhythm with him and we’re just cruising along and you turn in with a chance, you make him believe he’s got a chance and he gives you everything. There’s not a partnership, there’s no other satisfaction in the world that gives that to you, when you can be one with him like that.”Frost’s first ride back will be in a hurdle race on Atlantic Grey, a recent arrival at the Buckfast stable of her father, Jimmy. “He’s a lovely little horse, won there last time but this is a big step up in grade. I gave him a school this morning, he jumped really well and seems really happy. It’s gonna be nice to be let go and canter off down to the start on one of Dad’s.”Meanwhile, Aidan O’Brien has indicated that his St Leger winner, Kew Gardens, is a likely runner in Sunday’s Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, for which he is available at 16-1.

His victory, ensured the moment Mercedes employed orders allowing him to pass his teammate, Valtteri Bottas, proved an ill-sitting success defined by the decidedly uncelebratory figures of the Mercedes drivers on the podium as well as their team below them.Hamilton has been explicit in the past in his desire for the team not to employ orders and was uncomfortable with their use in Russia after he took the flag in front of Bottas.“It is definitely a win on my list of wins that I am least proud of,” he said. “The strangest day I can remember in my career. I want to win the right way. As racing drivers we exist to win if you tell us we can’t, it is like you are taking our life away. I would never wish it on someone else and I would never ask for it ever. I made sure in a meeting that they knew this is not how I want to win.”There was the expected disapproval that the distasteful spectre of team orders always provokes yet the decision was unsurprising. Team orders have long been legal in F1 and Mercedes, aware of Ferrari’s strong challenge this year, were unwilling to leave anything to chance.It is an unedifying way for a race to be decided but it was both understandable and planned for. With Sebastian Vettel finishing third, Hamilton extended his title lead to 50 points, a 10-point gain, as opposed to the three-point boost second place would have delivered.The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, charged with returning a drivers’ and constructors’ title, was as ruthless as his board members would have wanted. “It’s deflating for drivers and for a team but there is a harsh reality also,” he said. “On a day like this you can extend the lead by seven points more in a championship that has been very tough and difficult at times, so you have to take it.”Hamilton echoed his rationale given what might still happen in the five races that remain. “The team were considering the car breaking down or losing two more engines,” he said. “We could lose the championship and that was their reasoning, hard as it is to swallow.”Ultimately Mercedes’ decision was brought about after they had been caught on the hop by Ferrari. With Bottas leading from pole and Hamilton and Vettel settling into second and third, the Scuderia took the initiative, sending Vettel into the pits for the undercut. The move worked and after Hamilton’s stop he emerged behind the German.Hamilton had to charge and he pressured Vettel, who locked up through turn 13. Hamilton closed and made an effort to pass on the run to turn two. Vettel defended but was out of position and caught in turn four when Hamilton ed up the inside to retake the place.Coming back at Vettel had been at a cost of causing some blistering to his tyres. With the German still a threat the team opted to give Hamilton Bottas’s place, moving the Finn into a buffering position in front of Vettel.Bottas was visibly and understandably disappointed. He has yet to win this year and, with pole and leading the race, had done everything that might be expected of him. In Hungary last year, when he moved over for Hamilton, the British driver gave the place back when he could gain no advantage. The Finn may have hoped for a repeat but, with the title at stake, it was simply not going to happen.“Lewis is fighting for the drivers’ championship and I’m not,” Bottas acknowledged. “From the team’s point of view it was the ideal result today. Maybe not ideal for me but for the team, yes.”Vettel knows this was another stinging blow to his title hopes and, as he races for a team who have employed team orders brutally in the past, he was understanding of Mercedes’ decision. “Well done to both of them, they played together as a team very well,” he said. As the two Mercedes drivers faced the press afterwards he even came to their defence. “All the questions – I know you guys love controversy so therefore ask naughty questions to them as iniduals, but I think in the position they are it’s a no-brainer what they did today. Maybe not all the questions are justified.”Certainly Mercedes will not lose any sleep as they head to the next round in Japan. If Hamilton does take the title, he will still have some exceptional performances to remember long after the discomfort of this one is forgotten but he will also remember he has cause to be thankful to Bottas. “Never, ever in my whole life has it been the way I’ve wanted to win a race,” he said. “I just want to shine it on to Valtteri. There are not many teammates who would do something like that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac6c8b67d2cd628015f30b21925c9602eee109fe/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c99b0b1514b44616469d5359f150a8a","title":"rugby union talking points from the premiership weekend action","story":"The high-scoring extravaganzas should be enjoyed while they last but it seems nobody will get anywhere near the top twoWe know it will not last once the winter bites, but this has been quite the September if a points frenzy is your thing. This match was the highest scoring yet, although its 85 points register as only joint 24th on the chart of highest-scoring Premiership games. If we count only those that finish within a score, it comes in at fourth. Even the Kiwis seem impressed. Todd Blackadder the other week was resigned to the need just to score more than the opposition. This week Chris Boyd bemoaned the defence but accepted that when players look for space they are capable of finding it. Michael AylwinHarlequins moved up to fourth after their away win against a Gloucester side who would have frustrated the Shed, so prescriptive was their play. Quins’ next fixture is at home against Saracens on Saturday night. The champions have spent the past two weekends sending opponents who started the round in fourth place, Gloucester and Bath, scuttling down the table and Quins, never mind their first away league win for a year, are in similarly fickle form. But they have won their past three home league fixtures against Saracens and are developing some backbone. Paul ReesAfter a poor, nervy contest much of the post-match discussion revolved around two players who were not involved. Sale have revealed their South African scrum-half Faf de Klerk will be available to the club throughout the autumn international period, with an agreement having been reached with the Boks for the No 9 to remain in the southern hemisphere during the spare weeks in the Rugby Championship. With their game against England also falling outside the official Test window, Premiership Rugby regulations are also set to sideline other English-based Boks such as Willie Le Roux and Francois Louw for the Twickenham date. Leicester, meanwhile, might not risk recalling Manu Tuilagi for the game against Northampton this weekend. Tuilagi’s hamstring ruled him out of England training last week – “There wasn’t really much point in him getting in the car with a tight hamstring to go down and stand around on the sidelines,” said Geordan Murphy – and a return against the Saints is not yet certain. “It’s a question of whether or not he’s ready to roll next weekend, whether or not we need to use him or whether we rest him for another week,” Murphy said. Robert KitsonThree home defeats from three is a run of form that would ordinarily be of concern for Newcastle until you consider their opponents have been the Premiership’s top three sides from last season. The defeat by Wasps on Friday will have hurt most, having been ahead with 10 minutes to go but the Falcons still have plenty about which to be optimistic. Sinoti Sinoti was at his mesmeric best against Wasps and Johnny Williams at inside-centre is further demonstration of Dean Richards’s canny recruitment. They have already won once on the road this season and their ability to do so last term was a fundamental part of their run to the semi-finals. On Saturday they go to Sale. Gerard MeagherTodd Blackadder made 13 changes for the trip to Saracens and tasked his side with trying to come away with a losing bonus point. He argued his point by saying that “otherwise we’ll just end up playing our best team every single week and we’ll end up breaking guys”. The Rugby Football Union, Premiership Rugby and the Rugby Players’ Association will soon announce the finer details of how the domestic season will fit around the global calendar from 2020 onwards. Perhaps that will give a clue as to whether Blackadder’s approach to this game becomes a trend. Gerard MeagherA third successive Rugby Championship for New Zealand with room to spare but the Pumas produced one of the more infuriating performances in recent memory. Their scrum – once the bedrock of Argentinian rugby – was marmalised and they coughed up the ball on their lineout five times. If they can get their set-piece firing though, they will be a World Cup force to be reckoned with.The Connacht prop Dominic Robertson-McCoy is facing a lengthy ban for a horrible stamp to the head of Leinster’s Josh van der Flier. It earned him a red card as well as widespread condemnation following Leinster’s 20-3 victory and the Connacht coach Andy Friend at least acknowledged: “That wasn\u0027t good and Dom is really disappointed with himself.” That may be so but the authorities must send a strong message with a firm sanction.Huge credit must go to Nigel Owens for his intervention when Benetton’s Engjel Makelara tried to return to the field after it emerged his head injury assessment had not been carried out properly. Makelara attempted to come back on against Edinburgh seven minutes after initially going off but Owens questioned his return with medics from the Italian side. Makelara was then immediately withdrawn again after it came to light there was a technological issue with conducting the HIA.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5bf59f3743713d3a7e06b4e5ce70f2866e2d397/76_154_1507_904/master/1507.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1088d486de0c5dee6c3826d71beda023","title":"lord of the flies review theatr clwyd","story":"Theatr Clwyd, MoldWilliam Golding’s fable of desert-island anarchy is reinvented for the modern age in Emma Jordan’s brutal, bold productionThere’s a theory being pushed by the psychologist Michele Gelfand, of the University of Maryland. In Rule Makers, Rule Breakers, she suggests there are two types of society: the “tight” cultures, in which rules are strictly enforced, and the “loose” communities, in which things are more free and easy. She says Japan, where the trains run on time, is tight, and Brazil, where everyone arrives late, is loose.Looked at through this lens, Lord of the Flies is about a very particular threat. At risk for William Golding were the tight values of mid 20th-century Britain, a doctrine of discipline, civility and order that had seen the country through two world wars. The novelist, who took part in the D-day landings and knew all about man’s inhumanity to man, is concerned about the tribalism and savagery of his desert-island evacuees as they build a new social order after surviving a plane crash. But he is equally troubled by their departure from the norms of what he sees as civilised society. It’s not exactly that the abandonment of school uniform and disregard for the rule of the conch is as terrifying as the violence that follows, but he certainly sees them as two sides of the same coin.In the loose Britain of today, where forming a decent queue at a bus stop is beyond us, it is hard to accept the schoolmasterly implications of the book. You’d better keep your tie straight, Golding seems to say, or the world will descend into chaos. We’re less impressed now by the prep-school values of sporting prowess and snobby elitism, even if Golding’s insight into human behaviour seems spot on in our era of factionalism, cyberbullying and online echo chambers.This is an obstacle, which is why Emma Jordan’s muscular and brutal production is especially bold. Using the Nigel Williams adaptation, the director makes two crucial changes. The first is simply to set the story in the present day. Now the references to bombs being dropped heighten the apocalyptic air, intensified by Tim Mascall’s lighting that turns designer James Perkins’ driftwood platforms from a brooding sandy brown to an ominous slate grey. Meanwhile, the jeans and T-shirt aesthetic makes the children seem less priggish, less hidebound by public-school rules, more free to battle it out on their own terms.The more significant switch is in the casting. This is an all-female Lord of the Flies, no longer about a traditionally male form of competition, but about young women carving out their territory in a way that seems no less driven. Heading a uniformly excellent ensemble is Lola Adaja as a likable, compassionate Ralph, by rights the best leader but no match for the resolve and fierce physical charisma of Kate Lamb’s Jack.Being the voice of reason does no favours to Gina Fillingham’s Piggy, who wittily turns a geeky schoolboy into a bolshie teenage girl, quarrelsome and angry. And there’s a touch of Lady Macbeth in Hannah Boyce’s Roger, a manipulative politician assuming the power behind Ralph’s throne while hiding in plain sight.“I would have thought a pack of British girls would have put on a better show than this,” says Matthew Bulgo as their shocked rescuer, but whether they’re challenging the expectations of Britishness or femininity, there’s absolutely no reason they should."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dba62714d6af8f11c71a3ff71bb3fd47cf1c91b/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85eb986ae105bea3bd6bed02f4725b1c 660w","title":"how a disastrous change in perspective disempowered the left and let the right rise","story":"By dismissing the masses as fools, progressives confirmed all the culture warriors’ claimsIn August 2001, the radical writer and ﬁlm-maker Michael Moore presented HarperCollins with the manuscript later known as Stupid White Men. It was still being edited when the September 11 attack occurred. In the newly hyper-patriotic environment, the publisher baulked at releasing a book ridiculing George W Bush and the Republican administration, with chapters entitled Kill Whitey! and A Very American Coup.Moore was instructed to revise substantially a work that would, HarperCollins decreed, appear under the more palatable title Michael Moore: the American. That extraordinary editorial intervention, which ostensibly came directly from Rupert Murdoch himself, attracted the attention of a group of librarians. The outraged book-lovers publicised Moore’s predicament with sufficient vigour to ensure the text’s release in its original form.On the first day of its release, Stupid White Men sold all 50,000 copies of its print run – and by its fifth day was on its ninth printing. Quickly, it became a defining statement of opposition to the Bush administration in the early phases of the “war on terror”.Moore had grown up in the union town of Flint, Michigan, and in many respects his book was an excoriation of the new administration for its cruel indifference to blue-collar Americans. But his title also reflected, as the anti-corporate global justice movement with which he’d been associated disintegrated, the new hegemony of what we might call “smug politics”.Stupid White Men echoed a conviction common among progressives as soon as George W Bush took power: namely, the man was an idiot. It was not an unreasonable suggestion. President Bush possessed, for instance, an extraordinary ability to mangle the English language.“Our nation must come together to unite,” he explained at one point. “Is our children learning?” he said on another occasion.“Families,” Bush said, during a third speech, “is where our nation finds hope, where wings take dream.”In 2003, the journalist Frank Bruni explained that “the Bush I knew was part scamp and part bumbler, a timeless fraternity boy and heedless cutup, a weekday gym rat and weekend napster”. The president apparently loved fart jokes, and would let rip in front of new aides, conﬁdent that intentional flatulence helped the fresh appointees to settle in. When he received news of the September 11 terror attacks, Bush didn’t, at first, react – video footage that featured heavily in a subsequent Moore documentary showed him placidly continuing to read to schoolchildren from a book entitled The Pet Goat, as if he couldn’t grasp the magnitude of the catastrophe.Considerable evidence could thus be adduced for the Bush-was-a-moron theory.But what followed politically? If Bush was the stupidest of the stupid white men, how had he come to power? Who had voted for him? Most of all, why weren’t ordinary people rising up against the dangerous buffoon who ruled them?This was smug politics at its most overt, not just in the assessment of Americans as people “who love to revel in their stupidity”, but in its implication that the reader (“you and I”) was, like Moore himself, smarter than the ordinary dopes whom the book discussed.These formulations simply inverted the culture-war themes of the right. The Republican electoral campaign had, after all, contrasted George W Bush’s folksiness with the supposed superciliousness of his opponent, Al Gore. The September 11 atrocity and the outbreak of the “war on terror” facilitated the Republican efforts to build on this image. Bush became a war president – but a war president of a special type. His minders cast him as John Wayne: a hero, to be sure, but also an everyman, whose greatness distilled the values of the heartland.When Bush (who’d enlisted as a fighter pilot in Texas to evade the Vietnam War) arrived on an aircraft carrier in a flying suit to declare victory in Iraq, the NBC pundit Chris Matthews hosted Watergate felon Gordon Liddy to discuss his appearance.“You know, he’s in his flight suit,” said Liddy. “He’s striding across the deck, and he’s wearing his parachute harness … and it makes the best of his manly characteristic. … He has just won every woman’s vote in the United States of America. You know, all those women who say size doesn’t count – they’re all liars.”This grotesque exchange (and many others like it) provided credence to Moore’s assessment of American idiocy. Here was a political culture at rock bottom, with sycophantic journalists enthusing about how the president, unlike his effete opponents, possessed a large penis.Yet Moore’s argument that the people themselves were responsible for Bush’s antics implicitly reinforced the Republican case. The right equated the president with the American electorate, and distinguished them both from sneering elitists. Moore did exactly the same – except with the polarities reversed. Conservatives insisted the people and their leaders were wise Moore judged them both moronic.The first position was, for obvious reasons, far more politically successful than the second.The decline of the traditional leftwing infrastructure – parties, organisations, NGOs and the like – that previously might have given progressives a platform meant that leftwing or liberal celebrities took on an especial cultural significance during the Bush years. For many people on the left – especially as the internet became mainstream – politics became a matter of applauding or sharing an intervention by one or another progressive public figure. To cater to this need, a particular style of humour developed, associated with Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart and similar figure. Throughout the Bush years, progressives kept up their morale by blogging about the latest sketch in which Stewart cut some Fox News blowhard or another down to size.Yet such victories were always pyrrhic, since the ever-present snark of smug politics affirmed the right’s new-class theory even as it mocked it.The academic Jay Rosen identified something he called “the cult of savviness” within professionalism journalism. By savviness, he meant the quality of being knowing, ironic, perceptive, shrewd and unsentimental. “Savviness is what journalists admire in others,” Rosen wrote. “Savvy is what they themselves dearly wish to be. (And to be unsavvy is far worse than being wrong.)”The smug politics of the Bush era depended on the progressive embrace of savviness. The Daily Show–style gags only worked for a savvy crowd. Such jokes weren’t intended to convince anyone. In fact, almost by their nature, they couldn’t convince anyone. To get the sketch – which often consisted of little more than a clip of a conservative saying something stupid, followed by the liberal host mugging to the camera in mock amazement – the audience needed to already know and already accept the correct position.The new mode of smug politics was perfectly represented in the 2006 movie Idiocracy, a satire that presented the United States of the future as a dystopia dominated by overweight morons who spent their lives masturbating, eating junk food and watching programs like Ow! My Balls! The ﬁlm outlined its set-up by explaining that American society had reversed evolution, allowing the foolish to breed while the intelligent remained childless. As a result, progressive and enlightened iniduals were swamped by the backwardness of the great unwashed.Liberals may not have said openly that they regarded ordinary people as so stupid that their procreation threatened civilisation itself. Yet as a satire, Idiocracy spelled out the deep elitism embedded in the prevailing critique of conservatism.The consolatory power of the “idiot nation” trope was obvious. If voters were slack-jawed rubes, well, it couldn’t be the fault of progressives that protests were small or that leftwing ideas lacked purchase. Activists committed to smug politics could take comfort knowing that the masses were too dumb to grasp the cogent arguments being presented to them.But, politically, such rhetoric was disastrous. By dismissing the people as fools, progressives conﬁrmed everything the culture warriors said: they openly embraced the condescending stereotype of the liberal elitist.Political analyst Thomas Frank made the point that, despite the new-class presentation of progressives as elites, most leftists and liberals were not, and had never been, wealthy or powerful. Nevertheless, Frank argued, the increasing reliance on celebrities and the media meant that many ordinary people encountered progressive ideas in, say, magazine articles, where, as he put it, “singers who were big in the 70s express their concern with neatly folded ribbons for this set of victims or that”. In such settings, progressive causes seemed “a matter of shallow appearances, of fatuous self-righteousness … a politics in which the beautiful and the wellborn tell the unwashed and the beaten down how they should stop being racist or homophobic, how they should be better people”.Throughout the 60s and the early 70s, most progressive activists had seen “the people” (however that term was defined) as the solution to a sexist, racist oppression associated with the wealthy and the powerful. Increasingly, though, many progressives identified the masses not as the answer but as the problem, a foolish and slightly terrifying reservoir of cultural and political backwardness. This disastrous perspective – an implicit confirmation of the case being made by conservative culture warriors – would play an important role in the right’s ongoing successes.This is an edited extract from Trigger Warnings: Political Correctness and the Rise of the Right by Jeff Sparrow, published by Scribe on 1 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5309a64a3f49d8228f1a5536d429b1f6106b59c0/0_172_2899_1740/master/2899.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=482bc0088420233314f883028bf0e6cf","title":"japan us military base critic voted in as okinawa governor","story":"Election of Denny Tamaki, whose father was a US marine, will create headaches for Shinzo Abe and WashingtonControversial plans to relocate a major US military base in Okinawa, southern Japan, suffered a setback on Sunday after Denny Tamaki, who has vowed to block the move, was elected the island’s governor.Tamaki, whose father was a US marine, won on an anti-base platform and vowed to fight plans to move Futenma, a sprawling US marine base located in a built-up area, to a sparsely populated site on the island’s north-east coast.He defeated a candidate backed by the ruling coalition led by prime minister Shinzo Abe, whose government has been locked in a long battle against local residents over the future of Futenma.Tamaki, who has a Japanese mother and has never met his father, had promised to continue the campaign to stop the base move after the death in August of his predecessor, Takeshi Onaga. Tamaki, like most Okinawans, wants the existing facility to close and for its personnel and hardware to be moved off the island altogether.Onaga had tried to block attempts to reclaim land for the new offshore runway. He and the national government filed rival lawsuits to try to resolve the issue, with the supreme court ruling in the government’s favour in 2016.In August, however, the Okinawan prefectural government withdrew its approval landfill work approval – which effectively halts construction work – setting up another potential legal showdown with the national government.Opponents of the move say the new site, near the coastal village of Henoko, will destroy the area’s delicate marine ecosystem and endanger the safety of nearby residents.Tamaki, a former radio host and opposition MP, told jubilant supporters he backed the move, adding: “The strong feelings of Takeshi Onaga, risking his life to stop the construction of any more bases, helped bring us this victory.”Tamaki’s victory will have frustrated US military officials, who regard the Futenma relocation as essential to its ability to respond to crises in potential regional flashpoints in the South and East China seas, and to pressure North Korea into abandoning its nuclear weapons.In return for the relocation, Washington agreed to transfer about 8,000 troops and their dependents from Okinawa to Guam, Hawaii and other locations.The US state department congratulated Tamaki on his election. “The United States deeply values the contributions made by Okinawa to the US-Japan alliance and our two nations’ mutual security,” a spokesperson told Kyodo News.Senior politicians from the LDP and its junior coalition partner were frequent visitors to Okinawa in the run-up to Sunday’s election, highlighting the importance they attached to the result.The base’s relocation was agreed more than two decades ago as a way of reducing the US military footprint on the island following a surge in local opposition over the 1995 abduction and rape of a 12-year-old girl by three American servicemen.The Futenma base, in the middle of a densely populated city of Ginowan, has attracted frequent complaints about crime, noise and the threat of aircraft accidents in an area close to homes and schools."},{"url":null,"title":"graduate","story":"Graduates are well-positioned for jobs in policy, research, business and administration in the public and private sectorsToday\u0026rsquos graduates want more from work than just the pay chequeStudents are well-positioned as the growing economy increases employment demand for graduatesHow can graduates make sure they\u0026rsquore appreciated and what do their bosses expect in return?Personal ethics can be a guiding factor for graduates considering job offersFrom science to construction, skills shortages continue to be a challenge for employers across industryHow graduates can make sure they are skilled-up and job-readyEmployees are looking to companies for provision of workplace wellness initiativesInternational companies raise employee expectations of what a modern office should look likeAnxiety, stress and depression are the second highest causes of work-related illness in IrelandTeam-working, creativity and problem-solving are in demand among hiring managersWhat is likely to pay off the most \u0026ndash investing in furthering your education or starting your career instead?Graduates are well-positioned for jobs in policy, research, business and administration in the public and private sectorsInternships can be an effective way to gain work experience and increase your employability \u0026ndash but is there a downside?Jobseekers can take steps to maximise their chances of getting hiredHow employers use interviews to gain an understanding of what makes people tickAs soon as you walk into the building, you are on interview"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3646889.1538335734!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teacher in south dublin boarding school unfairly dismissed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA French teacher who was employed at Rathdown School, a private girls’ school in Glenageary, Co Dublin, has been awarded compensation of €34,000. File photograph: Google Street View  A teacher in a south Dublin fee-paying school was unfairly dismissed after drawing attention to concerns over boarding students’ living conditions, the Workplace Relations Commission has found.The French teacher who was employed at Rathdown School, a private girls’ school in Glenageary, was awarded compensation of €34,000.The teacher said she had alerted school authorities to a number of concerns over the health and safety of students at the school in 2015 and 2016, which she claimed were ignored.In a grievance letter in May 2016 , the teacher said she highlighted a number of complaints she had received from students regarding “freezing temperatures, dirty toilets and general cleanliness standards around the school”.The following August, the teacher – who had been a permanent staff member since 2008 – said she was dismissed by the school just days before the start of the new term.The teacher believed the school made a decision to “get rid of her” because of a number of issues between herself and management, including the health and safety concerns.The school, however, told the commission it was a genuine redundancy arising from a “substantial drop” in the number of students enrolling.This, the school said, was partly due to the discontinuation of an EU programme which sent foreign students to English-speaking schools.The school said the fact that she had raised a grievance “did not come into the equation”.It added that there were no alternative positions available because the number of international students had dropped so dramatically.In its decision on the teacher’s unfair dismissals claim, the Workplace Relations Commission said it was not convinced by the school’s argument.“It would seem to me that other matters were at play, including the grievance raised by the complainant in May 2016,” according to the commission’s adjudicator.The commission said that the teacher had been treated “shabbily” by her former employer.“The manner in which she was dismissed was unfair, procedures were non-existent and the rules of natural justice ignored, no notice of redundancy was given, no consultation took place, no alternative rules were subject to debate, the complainant was not offered the opportunity to appeal the decision to make her redundant.”It said there was a requirement for fair and open procedures in redundancy cases, However, it said the teacher has been subjected to “dismal treatment” .In addition, the commission found it took the school almost seven months to pay her statutory lump sum redundancy payment of €11,400.Also, it found that the teacher had been “left in a state of limbo” from August 2016 to March 2017 due to a delay receiving a P45. This created problems for the teacher seeking social welfare assistance or another job.In a separate complaint, the teacher argued that there had been breaches involving the school of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act (2005). The teacher argued that concerns over students’ living conditions has been “ignored.”The school, however, pointed out that not one student had withdrawn and it was liable to regular State inspections.The adjudicator found that while there was enough evidence to indicate that the teacher was “penalised on foot of the complaints she made regarding safety, health and welfare”, the complaint had failed.Another complaint by the teacher made under the Protected Disclosures Act was not upheld.Attempts to contact Rathdown School for comment over the weekend were unsuccessful."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Presidential candidate says he intends to build on the work of Mary McAleeseFounding director of UCC perinatal research body says it was \u0026lsquocomplete surprise\u0026rsquoDozens of people reported trapped in rubble of hotels and a mall in city of PaluFrench teacher had raised concerns over students\u0026rsquo living conditionsRoutes being taken over by Go-Ahead will lead to base and roster changes for some staffPresidential candidate gave salary to separate US charity she founded in 2015At the culinary courses in Killybegs, only 12 of 80 places are filled.

Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe   Presidential candidate Sean Gallagher has listed the directorships of four different companies as his main occupation in a declaration to the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo). Mr Gallagher is not required to submit such a declaration since he is not a public office holder. It is also a matter for Sipo if it accepts his submission but Mr Gallagher said he is publishing his declaration to set a “standard” for the presidency. The President does not make a declaration to Sipo as TDs and senators do, but Mr Gallagher said he is publishing one in the interests of transparency.His main occupations are listed as directorships of four businesses: Sean Gallagher Business Matters, Heart Metabolics Ltd, HWT Engineering and Clyde Real Estate Management, which also lists Mr Gallagher as its chief executive on its website. In addition, Mr Gallagher declares shares in GSN nutrition, HWT Engineering LTD and Sean Gallagher Business Matters. Under the “directorships” section, Mr Gallagher lists 24 companies of which he is a director, a large proportion of which share the address of his Dublin office on St Stephen’s Green. An interest in one residential and one commercial letting in Louth are also included, as are an 11 acre farm and property in Killygordon, Donegal, and a 25 per cent share in Mr Gallagher’s original family home in Ballyhaise, Co Cavan. Mr Gallagher currently lives in Delgany, Co Wicklow. He said the presidency should be as “transparent as possible because after all, it is taxpayers’ money” and claimed the “most surprising” aspect of a Public Accounts Committee (PAC)hearing last week was that an annual allowance for the President is “unaudited”. The PAC heard that the Office of the President has an annual unaudited allowance of €317,000, on top of his regular expenses and salary. President Michael D Higgins has promised to provide a “formal statement” about spending at Áras an Uachtaráin. He has said he has no difficulty answering questions about the allowance, which he said is spent on garden parties and tea parties as well as the hosting of foreign leaders.The Sunday Times reported that Mr Higgins has continued to draw down his €19,000 a year pension from the National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG), during his seven year term in Áras an Uachtaráin.The pension was built up while Mr Higgins was a lecturer in sociology and politics at NUIG, but he had never said if he continued to take the pension after becoming president in 2011.Mr Higgins did not take media questions during an appearance at the Ballinasloe Horse Fair on Sunday, but his spokesman said he “has not drawn down, and will not draw down, any pension entitlements arising from his previous services as members of the Oireachtas or as a government minister”.It was further argued that the President “gifts €169,952 to the State every year” by forgoing the Oireachtas and ministerial pensions and by taking a salary of €250,000, €76,493 less than he is entitled to. Mr Gallagher refused to be drawn on Mr Higgins’s university pension, saying he wants to “maintain a very positive campaign and not be critical or comment on the interests of other candidates”. “And I won’t be doing that in this case.”Meanwhile, Senator Joan Freeman is to formally launch her campaign for the presidency in Dublin on Monday.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3647416.1538385367!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sean gallagher promises to campaign for a united ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresidential candidate Sean Gallagher speaking to media during a vist to the Pregnancy \u0026 Baby Fair at the RDS.

Mr Gallagher also said on Monday if elected he would welcome the opportunity to address local authorities in Northern Ireland. The office of president was about working within the parameters, he said: “it is less about legislation and more about imagination. The president can do much to set the tone.”Mr Gallagher told The Times Ireland on Monday he would campaign for a united Ireland by speaking to local authorities in the North.“There is an important piece of work to be done now in relation to Northern Ireland. It is a process, building on what Mary and Martin McAleese did. Some people would say, ‘well it is not in the constitution as a role’ but they made it happen.“I think we will see a united Ireland in my life. Partition never served Ireland in the past and I do not believe it will serve Ireland in the future.“The work now that needs to happen before we can unite territories and jurisdictions, is that we need to unite communities and iniduals. It is about building contact, strengthening relationships and building a foundation of trust.”During the same interview Mr Gallagher described Brexit as a mistake and said Ireland needed to strengthen its relationship with the UK.Mr Gallagher said he was surprised to learn the €317,000 allowance provided to the president every year was not audited.He said all public funding should be audited. Mr Gallagher said he planned to fund his campaign through savings and donations.Mr Gallagher told the Newstalk Breakfast programme he had been “incredibly impressed” by Michael D Higgins and his presidency. Notwithstanding this, he said a fresh approach was required. He decided to contest the presidency for a second time as he felt he had to come back following the tweet during the last live debate.Mr Gallagher also acknowledged the tweet during the last live debate during the 2011 election had changed everything for him.Even though he felt he had addressed the issue sufficiently prior to the debate, the tweet “caused me to doubt my own memory.“Live on air you get thrown. It was unfortunate that happened, people switched.“I put my hands up, that was not my finest performance. I should have been clearer. It was a costly mistake for me personally.” He said the televised debates will be different this time due to changes by the Broadcast Authority, he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3646898.1538336821!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"joan freeman did not donate seanad salary to pieta house as pledged","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Joan Freeman said she would donate her €66,277 Seanad salary  to Pieta House, where she had served as chief executive until the end of 2014.

A spokeswoman for Ms Freeman said the donation amounted to her full Seanad salary “after tax and pension deductions, which Ms Freeman was obliged to deduct”.In a May 2016 Facebook post, Pieta House congratulated Ms Freeman on her Seanad appointment, and said it was “proud and supportive of Joan’s decision to give the whole salary that goes with the role of Senator back to our life-saving service”.Commenting at the time on donating her salary Ms Freeman said “I was appointed a Senator because of Pieta House so it’s only right that Pieta House and the community benefit as a result of this”.The charity provides help and support to people suffering from suicide ideation or who self-harm, and organises the annual Darkness into Light fundraising walk.Solace House is a counselling charity set up to offer support services to the Irish diaspora.Ms Freeman has donated her Seanad salary to the American charity from May 2016 to December 2017, a spokeswoman said. The charity was first incorporated as Pieta House Inc as a pilot programme, before it was named Solace House.Separately, Pieta House has warned staff and volunteers to avoid wearing charity branding if canvassing during the presidential election.The charity recently sent an internal note to staff and volunteers warning that their support of any election candidate should not be “associated in any way with the employee’s or volunteer’s work at Pieta House”.The note warned the “employeevolunteer must also not wear clothing or have materials that would lead the public to believe that the person is representing Pieta House”.“Confusion in the minds of the public could pose a risk to the charitable status of Pieta House. The consequences for Pieta House, should it be in breach of charities law, would be extremely serious,” the memo stated.In a statement to The , Ms Freeman said she “absolutely” agreed with the guidelines issued by the charity.“In the early stages of my campaign, I became aware members of the team had contacted Darkness into Light volunteers seeking support for my nomination by using my mobile phone contacts. As soon as I became aware of this I issued an instruction not to do so,” she said.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3647401.1538381592!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit explainer the three options available with six months to go","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe EU has given Britain until mid-October to strike a deal that will avoid creating a hard border with Ireland. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireThere are exactly six months to go before Britain leaves the EU. With time running out to reach a Brexit deal, Theresa May is confronted with the choice she has tried to avoid since becoming prime minister: retaining unfettered access to European markets or bolstering the UK’s autonomy.The EU has given Britain until mid-October to strike a deal that will avoid creating a hard border with Ireland – the biggest remaining obstacle in the orce talks.But the two sides also have to come to an initial understanding on Britain’s long-term relationship with the bloc, which could determine the country’s trajectory for decades.The challenge for the prime minister is to find a solution acceptable both to Brussels and the House of Commons that will achieve an orderly Brexit and reduce the uncertainty hanging over business and the economy.For months she has sought to square the circle with her so-called Chequers proposal, under which Britain would follow the EU’s rule book for goods trade, but go its own way on services and the free movement of people.But Chequers is opposed by some 60 Conservative MPs and the opposition Labour party. European leaders at this month’s Salzburg summit also objected to it as cherry-picking that could allow the UK to undercut Europe’s stringent regulations.Here are the remaining options open to the UK and the EU – their prospects for resolve the Irish border question their likely economic consequences and their chances of success.EEA membership would ensure that goods and services sold in Britain were automatically free to be sold in the rest of the EU. Britain would need to align with European rules for goods and services.To ensure frictionless trade – avoiding customs declarations for goods at ports – the UK would need to retain membership of a customs union with the EU, precluding separate trade deals with other countries.Many advocates of this option see this as an interim, medium-term phase until technology can resolve Irish border issues.George Yarrow, chair of the Regulatory Policy Institute and emeritus fellow of Hertford College, Oxford, has long favoured this stepping stone route for Brexit. “In the long run, a customs union is a seriously inhibiting factor for the UK as a global trading nation,” he said.Solved as long as the UK remains in a customs union.This is the least damaging form of Brexit. The government estimates that there will be a hit of 1.6 per cent of GDP to the economy once customs barriers are erected, but this will be significantly less – 0.5 per cent – if Britain stays in the customs union. The government also estimates that there would be no detrimental effect to public finances.The EEA option would be acceptable in Brussels. It has some support in both the Labour and Conservative parties. But it is not acceptable to Mrs May because it would violate her red lines on three issues: European courts having a role in Britain freedom of movement and the ability to strike trade deals ahead of leaving the EU customs union.A customs union with the EU would give the UK autonomy over its services, which comprise 80 per cent of the economy, while keeping its membership of the single market in goods and agriculture. Border issues would be resolved but almost all free trade agreements with other countries would be prohibited.The withdrawal of Britain from the single market in services would be a hit to the economy. The OECD estimates that services trade barriers within the EU are four times smaller than those between the EU and non-members.Jagjit Chadha, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said that a middle way “guarantees a reasonable level of trade access to the EU” but there would be costs in “continuing uncertainty over the trading relationship for some time”.The government has not produced an exact estimate of the costs, but its models suggest a long-term cost of 3 per cent of GDP from the gradual ergence of services regulationA possible compromise but unlikely to satisfy many people. Theresa May would balk at the membership of a customs union Brexiters would complain of their inability to strike trade deals and the common regulation of goods Brussels would see a British attempt to cherry pick the single market. This would be tough to negotiate.The hard Brexit option. The UK would have autonomy to set its own regulations, and its immigration and trade policies. There would be no tariffs between the UK and the EU, but there would be significant non-tariff barriers from customs and regulatory checks at borders.Julian Jessop, chief economist of the Institute of Economic Affairs, who supports this option, accepts that there would be costs. “Trade with the EU will not be as frictionless as now,” he said.He stressed that it is much easier to measure costs of a policy than its longer-term benefits, but he believes there are many potential gains for Britain from autonomous regulations and trade policy.“An FTA is the combination that has the best chance of minimising the additional costs and maximising the potential benefits,” he said. “I can’t say with a high degree of confidence whether this is definitely better or worse than the current relationship as an EU member. But this action would give us the best possible chance”.Would require a technological solution, which is currently unavailable, or agreement that Northern Ireland would have a different customs regime and separate goods regulations from the rest of the UK.The vast majority of economists suggest this would be the most painful form of Brexit: additional trade barriers would be large while potential benefits of trade deals with the US and other countries would be small.The government model suggests a long-term hit to the economy of just under 5 per cent of GDP. Most other estimates are in a similar range. The IEA is an outlier. It calculates net benefits of up to 7 per cent of GDP, once many trade deals had been signed and what they call improved regulation are introduced.Acceptable to Brussels, so long as Britain agrees to the Irish backstop, under which there is no hard border iding the island of Ireland, and to many Brexiter-Conservatives. However, it is unacceptable to Mrs May, on the grounds that the Irish backstop would tear apart the integrity of the UK.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Win McNameePoolReuters I never thought it could be as brutal.The same Republican gargoyles who once tore Anita Hill limb from limb knew they had to tread gingerly, with women at the barricades. They outsourced the estrogen to “a female assistant,” as Mitch McConnell called Maricopa County sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell.And race, which scorched the Hill-Thomas hearings, was not a part of this excruciating face-off. Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh were summoning memories of summer days in the very white, very cosseted country club, prep school world of suburban Washington.But, shockingly, it was more brutal.Not only because the sexual transgression Blasey Ford was describing was more savage. But also because Kavanaugh simply adapted Clarence Thomas’s playbook of raging against the machine. Thomas’s fury was white-hot. Kavanaugh’s weepy. But the pitch was the same.“This is a circus,’’ Thomas seethed in 1991.“This is a circus,’’ Kavanaugh seethed on Thursday.Kavanaugh echoed Thomas’s martyrdom, claiming he was being “destroyed” by partisans conspiring to dig up dirt. He charged that Democrats were conducting a “grotesque and co-ordinated character assassination” because of their anger about President Donald Trump’s ascent and their desire for revenge after his own seamy work helping Ken Starr in his pervy pursuit of Bill Clinton.It was a cri de coeur custom-made for the age of Trump – and custom-designed to please Trump himself: entitled white men acting like the new minority, howling about things that are being taken away from them, aggrieved at anything that diminishes them or saps their power.As the Atlantic noted, Kavanaugh brandished Yale as “a magic wand, something that could be waved to dispel questions of his conduct”.Thomas prevailed over Hill because of that lava flow of anger. The senators were frozen, Pompeii-style, as he cried racism to snatch the mantle of victim.Hill’s aloof, dispassionate description of Thomas’s harassment, and her preternaturally cool reaction to all the lurid slanders hurled at her, left the senators skeptical that she was telling the truth shouldn’t a wronged woman show more emotion?Six years later, when Hill wrote a book, the law professor explained that, as the youngest of 13 from a rural Oklahoma family, she had had years of practice in “being impervious to and immobile in the face of hurt”.Hill’s mother was left to express the emotion that her daughter reined in when the Senate confirmed Thomas to the Supreme Court, the mother snapped, “The dirty rascals.”Hill seemed so poised and polished at 35, you had to remind yourself that she was a less-assured 25-year-old personal assistant when Thomas spewed his talk about bestiality and porn stars’ anatomies. But there was no need to remind people on Thursday that the dignified professional woman at the witness table was describing something from 36 years ago.The Palo Alto psychology professor laced her testimony with scientific terms like “sequelae,” “norepinephrine” and “hippocampus”. But it was easy to visualize the 15 year old in the 51-year-old with the girlish voice and guileless air as she repeatedly pushed a blond strand of hair out of her face, smiled nervously and tried oh so hard to please everyone. Her emotions, including panic, seemed close to the surface.The pentimento of the teenage Blasey Ford made her seem achingly vulnerable. Like Hill, she had a purity to her manner and story that was luminous, an impressive contrast to all the dark obfuscations, self-serving political manoeuvring and petty deceptions around her.Kavanaugh had seemed to dissemble a few times in his earlier testimony, including about his role in the case of the stolen Democratic documents in the Bush years and his role in the NSA’s warrantless wiretapping programme.And he appeared to do so again on Thursday, pretending the “Renate alumnius” in the Georgetown Prep yearbook was an affectionate term for his “great friend” who called the innuendo “horrible, hurtful and simply untrue”. He said the vomiting that gained him entry to the “Beach Week Ralph Club” was about spicy food more than drinking. Right. Again treating the senators like idiots, he provided innocent meanings for clearly salacious terms used like “Devil’s Triangle”.The nominee whom Ted Cruz defended as “a boring boy scout” became a sneering portrait of privilege denied.When Amy Klobuchar, citing her father’s alcoholism, asked if Kavanaugh had ever blacked out from drinking, he snapped back, “I don’t know – have you?’’Jeff Flake was so unnerved by the blast of opposition to his decision to vote for Kavanaugh that he led a scheme to get a week’s delay to have the FBI investigate.So we will finally drag Mark Judge, the man named by Blasey Ford as the third person in the room that night, out of his beachfront hideout. If the Republicans wanted to discern the character of who they’re putting on the court, rather than simply solidifying the conservative majority, they would already have subpoenaed Judge and anyone else who could provide clarity.The hope that the FBI will save the day may be misplaced. In the case of Anita Hill, agents were deployed by Republicans to help smear her.Even if Kavanaugh is confirmed, he already seems warped by this experience – just like Thomas was, when he went on to the bench as a very angry and bitter man.But at least we have a few more days to pretend to look for the truth."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3647389.1538378552!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us and canada reach last minute trade deal to replace nafta","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS president Donald Trump  and Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau.  Canada and the United States  struck a trade deal to replace Nafta. File photograph: Neil HallEPAPool The United States and Canada reached a last minute deal to salvage the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) on Sunday, overcoming deep isions to keep the 25-year-old trilateral pact intact.The deal came after a weekend of frantic talks to try and preserve a trade agreement that has stitched together the economies of Mexico, Canada and the United States but that was on the verge of collapsing.After more than a year of tense talks and strained relations between US president Donald Trump and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, negotiators from both sides came to a resolution just before a midnight deadline (5am Irish time) set by the White House.The eleventh-hour agreement was punctuated by a frenetic Sunday, with Canada’s leaders teleconferencing throughout the day with top US officials in Washington. Mr Trudeau convened a 10pm Cabinet meeting in Ottawa to brief officials on the deal, as Jared Kushner, one of Trump’s closest advisers, and Robert Lighthizer, the president’s top trade negotiator, hashed out the final details.In a joint statement, Mr Lighthizer and Canada’s foreign affairs minister, Chrystia Freeland, said the new deal “will give our workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses a high-standard trade agreement that will result in freer markets, fairer trade and robust economic growth in our region.”The trilateral deal will no longer be called Nafta, they said, but will be named the “United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.” The deal represents a win for Trump, who has derided Nafta for years and threatened to pull the United States from the pact if it was not rewritten in America’s favour.Overhauling trade deals has been one of Mr Trump’s top priorities as president and he has used tariffs and other threats to try and force trading partners to rewrite agreements in America’s favour.US industry groups cheered the deal on Sunday night. “Manufacturers are extremely encouraged that our call for a trilateral agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico has been answered,” Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. –New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"art student jessie earl disappeared 38 years ago has mystery","story":"On Wednesday 14 May 1980 Jessie Earl, a 22-year-old student at Eastbourne College of Art and Design, walked into a telephone box on the seafront to call her parents at their home in south London.

If not, he would call early elections.Greece reacted to the result with the Foreign Ministry saying it remains committed to its June agreement with Skopje under which Athens would drop its objections to Macedonia joining the EU and NATO in return for a change of name.Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras expressed his support for his Macedonian counterpart in a telephone call in which he hailed the determination and courage of Zoran Zaev to complete the implementation of this agreement, a government source told AFP.A Muslim cleric casts his ballot at polling station during the referendum in Skopje, MacedoniaNATO head Jens Stoltenberg said on Twitter the result was a historic opportunity, adding: NATO\u0027s door is open.“The government has always said that the referendum is consultative,” said Simonida Kacarska, the director of the European Policy Institute, a think tank in Skopje.“We will have to see what the vote is. But a low turnout could make it more difficult to get the deal through and to obtain the two-thirds majority of support in parliament that is needed to make changes to the constitution.”The country’s long-standing desire to be known as Macedonia has been blocked by Athens ever since the Balkan country declared independence from the wreckage of the former Yugoslavia in 1991.The Greeks are fiercely protective of their own region of Macedonia and resent what they regard as the Macedonians’ appropriation of Hellenistic culture and historical figures such as Alexander the Great.There had been protests against the vote in Macedonia name change referendumBut in an accord signed in June, Athens agreed to lift its veto on the tiny Balkan nation joining NATO and the EU if it changes its name to North Macedonia.The referendum was a chance to ditch the long-winded and inelegant name that Macedonians have been saddled with for the last 27 years – the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, or FYROM for short.“There are no jobs for young people here. My son has no prospects. We have big economic problems. So I think joining the EU and Nato will offer us a better future,” said Tiho, a 56-year-old taxi driver in the capital, who said he had voted yes.But others deeply resent having to add a geographical qualifier to their country’s name, saying that the title North Macedonia is a humiliation and diminishes the country’s stature.“It’s emotional. This is a country whose language and identity have been contested by its neighbours.“Part of the population is concerned that the change of name will change certain identity markers, even though our nationality and language will be recognised as Macedonian,” said Prof Kacarska, who gained her PhD at Leeds University.The question that was put to voters in the referendum was: Are you in favour of membership in the European Union and NATO by accepting the deal between (the) Republic of Macedonia and Republic of Greece?Both Zoran Zaev, the Macedonian prime minister, and his Greek counterpart, Alexis Tsipras, have stuck their necks out politically and face trenchant opposition from domestic critics.Greek protesters chant slogans against the name change deal during a rally in the Greek city of Thessaloniki, as Macedonians went to the pollsNikola Dimitrov, the foreign minister and one of the architects of the deal, voted in the centre of the capital, describing the referendum as a “historic cross-roads” and the potential start of a new chapter for the country.“This is a big, big day for Macedonia and for our friendship with Greece. I’m excited. It’s also my birthday, so I hope there is an omen in that too,” he said.But hours later, opposition groups who had called for a boycott of the vote declared the referendum a failure.Outside parliament, a few hundred anti-referendum campaigners in exuberant mood gathered in front of a stage, celebrating to rock music, draping Macedonian flags over their shoulders and holding banners that read “Macedonia Forever” and “This Was, Is and Will Remain Only Macedonia.” “Macedonian people do not want to join NATO.

Or is youth simply a time of life when people feel isolation most keenly?,” Hammond asked.“To help them to connect with others, young people today have social media. They are more connected than ever before. But this can bring its own problems. If you’re feeling lonely, looking at pictures of other people appearing to have endless fun isn’t going to help with those feelings of isolation.”However, Professor Pam Qualter from the University of Manchester, which helped compile the research, said the fact that young people were reporting more intense feelings of loneliness could indicate that the issue is in fact one of learning to cope.“You might not know at that age that you’re going to overcome this,” she said. Throughout the life course, you begin to realise loneliness is a feeling that doesn’t last forever. Younger people experience loneliness more intensely because it might be the first time they’ve experienced it at all.”Professor Christina Victor, from Brunel University London, which was also involved in the survey, supported this view, saying the phenomenon of youth loneliness could simply have gone unreported until now.“For all we know, the loneliness of the young could be a continuation of a pattern dating back to the 1950s. It’s just we never bothered to ask,” she said. The survey - developed by academics at the University of Manchester, Brunel University London, and the University of Exeter, and supported by a grant from Wellcome - asked people to answer a range of online questions on their mental wellbeing.Professor Louise Arseneault from Kings College London, which has long studied loneliness, said she was not surprised by its findings.“I trust this data. It seems we have overlooked some issues in teenage years or young adulthood that could be responsible for feelings of isolation. We tend to think of those years as being about partying and making relationships but, actually, they’re not that easy. Historically, we’ve tended to ignore that,” she said. The programme, recorded in front of a live audience at Wellcome Collection, will be broadcast on Monday at 8pm.Photographer at centre of Nobel row given two year jail term for rapeConservative Party conference day two live: Philip Hammond mocks Boris Johnson and claims he would be ill-suited to leading Brexit talksAirbnb and Uber urged to act on teenage drug mules Restrict benefits for new EU migrants to stem flood of unskilled workers, says Iain Duncan Smith reportEU diplomats hit back at Jeremy Hunt over Soviet Union comparisonMore than one in four weekend GP appointments left unused, investigation finds Prime suspects in IRA Birmingham pub bombings to be named by ITVUS Midterm elections 2018: Why this year\u0026#39s congressional elections matterUS midterm elections 2018 poll tracker: Who will win the Congress?What the House of Representatives means in US politics - and how it could change at the midtermsTheresa May’s is the most ided Tory government of the post-war era Iran strikes \u0026#39terrorist\u0026#39 targets in Syria in retaliation for Revolutionary Guards attackAcid victim posts online appeal from hospital bed after \u0026#39random\u0026#39 attackJapanese politician kicked out of meeting for sucking cough dropsStrictly Come Dancing 2018 first results show, live: Susannah Constantine is first out, meaning partner Anton Du Beke\u0026#39s earliest exitWhy North Koreans are now more willing to stay than defect to the SouthFighting for an English-speaking homeland - meet the Anglophone separatists waging war in CameroonComment: The Tory party needs some wind in its sails, but Theresa May has refused to even leave portThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendIndonesia tsunami: Appeal for international help as mass grave dug for 1,300 victimsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/25/TELEMMGLPICT000133229415_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq-LJS7LKjeK9Zr8QxHnNHG4itpGhsZrUs3owZAjQ2uWw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"one four weekend gp appointments left unused investigation finds","story":"37 per cent of Sunday GP appointments are being left unfilledMore than one in four GP appointments are left unused at weekends, amid a “shocking” failure of policies to improve access to family doctors, an investigation has found.Ministers have repeatedly promised to expand opening hours of GP surgeries, so that working people are able to get appointments during evenings and weekends.But the research from areas offering such access shows 37 per cent of Sunday appointments are being left unfilled, along with 24 per cent of Saturday slots, and 23 per cent of those on weekday evenings.This means around half a million appointment slots have been left empty since April.Meanwhile, waiting times to see a GP are rising, with one in four patients now facing a wait of at least a week .Family doctors said the findings showed that the policy, at a time of growing GP shortages, was a “ridiculous luxury” which was making it harder for patients to get an appointment during the week.In 2014, then Prime Minister David Cameron said every patient should be be able to get an GP appointment in their local area between 8am and 8pm, seven days a week, later making it an manifesto pledge.In 2014, then Prime Minister David Cameron said every patient should be be able to get a GP appointment in their local area between 8am and 8pm, seven days a weekBut the policy - which is due to be rolled out nationally today - has sparked a backlash from many family doctors, who say it is costing vast sums and leaving them spread too thinly.There is also concern that GP practices are failing to tell patients that they could have appointments at evenings and weekends.The new investigation by Pulse, comes from Freedom of Information disclosures from 80 of 210 NHS clinical commissioning groups, which are responsible for GP services.The  lowest take up was in NHS Thanet CCG, in Kent, with just three per cent of available appointments taken up on Sundays, since April.In Greenwich, South London, less than 20 per cent of slots were taken on Sundays, with 21 per cent taken in Blackpool, 25 per cent in Isle of Wight and 26 per cent in Morecambe Bay.  By 202021, more than £500m a year is due to have been spent on schemes to expand access.Dr Richard Vautrey, BMA GP Committee chairman, said: “Because it has become a political must-do, everybody is jumping. We understand there is huge pressure from the centre on CCGs to demonstrate they are providing a full seven-day service.“Sensible CCGs that want to use their resources in a better way are under pressure to maintain a service that really isn’t good value for money.“That is ridiculous so I think we really do need to see much more common sense and pragmatic flexibility… if we had the luxury of resource and workforce then we could look at extending the service but until then we’ve got to focus on what is most important.”Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said the findings were of great concern.“GPs want to give patients access to services they need but this will differ depending on local demographics. At a time when general practice is struggling for resources and patients are waiting longer for routine appointments, to find out so many evening and weekend appointments have been unfilled due to lack of demand is shocking.”The latest GP survey shows almost one in four patients wait at least a week for an appointment, almost twice as many as when similar questions were posed six years ago.And 29.7 per cent of those who had attempted to make appointments had struggled to get through on the phones - a rise from 18.6 per cent in 2012.Thanet CCG, which had 26 per cent take up of Saturday slots, along with 3 per cent take up on Sundays said it nonetheless planned to increase the number of weekend appointments on offer.A spokesman said: “We are working with our team to ensure there is a publicity campaign across East Kent prior to the national 1 October go-live date. Our expectation is that uptake will improve once awareness increases and will build with time.”He said the plans would mean around 200 extra appointments would be made available at evenings and weekends.“We have no reason to believe we’ll have an issue fillingthe available slots,” he said.  An NHS England spokesman said: “Even though six out of 10 CCGs didn’t respond to this small survey, the more representative results of the annual GP survey and the patient response to new digital-first GP providers is clear: patients want quicker access to a trusted GP both during the working week and outside traditional surgery hours, and are increasingly prepared to vote with their feet to get it.”Conservative Party conference day two live: Philip Hammond mocks Boris Johnson and claims he would be ill-suited to leading Brexit talksAirbnb and Uber urged to act on teenage drug mules Restrict benefits for new EU migrants to stem flood of unskilled workers, says Iain Duncan Smith reportEU diplomats hit back at Jeremy Hunt over Soviet Union comparisonPrime suspects in IRA Birmingham pub bombings to be named by ITVUS Midterm elections 2018: Why this year\u0026#39s congressional elections matterUS midterm elections 2018 poll tracker: Who will win the Congress?What the House of Representatives means in US politics - and how it could change at the midtermsTheresa May’s is the most ided Tory government of the post-war era Iran strikes \u0026#39terrorist\u0026#39 targets in Syria in retaliation for Revolutionary Guards attackAcid victim posts online appeal from hospital bed after \u0026#39random\u0026#39 attackJapanese politician kicked out of meeting for sucking cough dropsStrictly Come Dancing 2018 first results show, live: Susannah Constantine is first out, meaning partner Anton Du Beke\u0026#39s earliest exitLoneliness is felt most intensely by young people, study finds (and turning to Facebook doesn\u0026#39t help)Why North Koreans are now more willing to stay than defect to the SouthFighting for an English-speaking homeland - meet the Anglophone separatists waging war in CameroonComment: The Tory party needs some wind in its sails, but Theresa May has refused to even leave portThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendIndonesia tsunami: Appeal for international help as mass grave dug for 1,300 victimsUS and Canada agree \u0026#39modernised\u0026#39 trade deal to replace Nafta We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/09/30/TELEMMGLPICT000004029089_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bql_-dn_bkBoeGShbklIuDGiATUoVmv_XQtM6PFyzMefw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"prime suspects ira birmingham pub bombings named itv","story":"Devastation at the Mulberry Bush pub in 1974An ITV documentary will claim tonight to have identified two suspects in the IRA Birmingham pub bombings.The suspects will be named as a former labourer who was a teenager at the time of the atrocity, and an ex-British soldier turned IRA terrorist. The ex-soldier James Francis Gavin, who is now dead, has been identified before in connection with the Birmingham bombings. The second man, who now lives in Belfast and is in his 60s, has never previously been named in public.The new suspect strenuously denies any involvement in the attack when the allegations were put to him by ITV Exposure, which is being broadcast on Monday.The bomb attacks on two pubs in Birmingham on November 21 1974, left 21 people killed and 220 injured. The so-called Birmingham Six were found guilty of the murders a year later but the convictions were overturned in one of Britain’s worst miscarriages of justice.The scene outside the Tavern in the Town pubThe documentary claims that the Crown Prosecution Service has previously examined the case against the suspect and concluded there is insufficient evidence to charge him.The programme - called The Hunt for the Birmingham Bombers - will allege that the men, both part of an IRA cell in Birmingham, are suspects who may have planted the bombs in the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs.The younger, alleged bomber was convicted of terrorism offences in 1976 and sentenced to ten years in jail for a bombing campaign in the West Midlands in 1974, separate from the Birmingham pub attacks. In those attacks nobody was killed. When confronted by John Ware, the veteran documentary maker behind the ITV Exposure programme, the suspect said: “I’ve got nothing to say… Well, you can ask what you want, but I’m not going to answer… You’re wasting your time.”ITV Exposure says the suspect’s ‘charge sheet’ is similar to a description of the suspect spoken to by Chris Mullin, a journalist and former Labour minister, who had campaigned for the release of the Birmingham Six. Mr Mullin declined to say if the suspect identified by ITV Exposure is the same man he spoke to. He told the programme: “I’m not naming that inidual, whoever was the young planter.”The Birmingham Six with Chris Mullin (centre) celebrate the quashing of their convictionsCourt documents obtained by ITV Exposure show that during the police investigation into the ‘young planter’ for the other offences, He was questioned about his links to the pub attacks. The suspect admitted that he knew there were going to be attacks on the night of the pub bombings.In his interview with West Midlands Police Detective Chief Inspector, Tom Banks, the suspect said: “To tell you the truth, I was told there was something going to happen but I didn’t know there was going to be people killed.”Julie Hambleton and campaigners outside the High CourtThe decision by ITV to identify the two suspects will further anger victims’ families, distraught that fresh inquests to be held into the Birmingham bombings will not name suspects. The Court of Appeal ruled last week that a coroner was right to exclude investigations into responsibility for the attacks.Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine was murdered in the Birmingham pub bombings and who now runs the campaign group Justice4the21, said: “If these men are going to be named on television it is absurd they cannot be named in the inquests. It makes a mockery of our justice system. We don’t know if these men are responsible but we would like that to be examined and the inquest should be doing that.”The suspect’s lawyer told ITV: “Our client denies all the allegations … and does not intend to respond any further to the unfounded allegations you have made.”The Hunt For The Birmingham Bombers is due to be broadcast on ITV at 10.40pm on Monday Oct 1Conservative Party conference day two live: Philip Hammond mocks Boris Johnson and claims he would be ill-suited to leading Brexit talksAirbnb and Uber urged to act on teenage drug mules Restrict benefits for new EU migrants to stem flood of unskilled workers, says Iain Duncan Smith reportEU diplomats hit back at Jeremy Hunt over Soviet Union comparisonMore than one in four weekend GP appointments left unused, investigation finds US Midterm elections 2018: Why this year\u0026#39s congressional elections matterUS midterm elections 2018 poll tracker: Who will win the Congress?What the House of Representatives means in US politics - and how it could change at the midtermsTheresa May’s is the most ided Tory government of the post-war era Iran strikes \u0026#39terrorist\u0026#39 targets in Syria in retaliation for Revolutionary Guards attackAcid victim posts online appeal from hospital bed after \u0026#39random\u0026#39 attackJapanese politician kicked out of meeting for sucking cough dropsStrictly Come Dancing 2018 first results show, live: Susannah Constantine is first out, meaning partner Anton Du Beke\u0026#39s earliest exitLoneliness is felt most intensely by young people, study finds (and turning to Facebook doesn\u0026#39t help)Why North Koreans are now more willing to stay than defect to the SouthFighting for an English-speaking homeland - meet the Anglophone separatists waging war in CameroonComment: The Tory party needs some wind in its sails, but Theresa May has refused to even leave portThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendIndonesia tsunami: Appeal for international help as mass grave dug for 1,300 victimsUS and Canada agree \u0026#39modernised\u0026#39 trade deal to replace Nafta We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/10/01/08/aldi.jpg","title":"aldi sales uk discount new stores latest","story":"Created with Sketch.Join us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeJoin us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 14 daysSee the optionsDiscount supermarket says expansion will create 5,000 new UK jobs over next two yearsClick to followThe IndependentThe supermarket added more than 1 million new customers last yearAldi sales for the UK and Ireland passed the £10bn point in 2017, and the discounter has announced plans to open 120 new stores in the next two years.

When private equity firm Investindustrial bought a 37.5 per cent stake in 2012, Aston Martin was valued about £400m.Car manufacturers are expected to be among the hardest hit by Brexit, because they rely on hundreds of parts sourced from across the Continent. Industry figures have warned that any delays at the border or other additional administrative burdens could prove disastrous.But chief executive Andy Palmer said last month that Aston is “well insulated” from problems that could result from the UK crashing out of the EU without a trade deal.“We can demonstrate that Brexit is not a major effect for us,” he said.“If there is a tariff into Europe, it’s countered by a tariff into the UK for our competitors so you might lose a little bit of market share in the EU but you pick it up in the UK.”Aston Martin sells roughly 25 per cent of its cars to the EU and operates its only plant in Britain, with a second one due to begin operations in 2019.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

One of the parents’ initiatives was an annual pantomime.At a script-writing session, held in someone’s kitchen, our host, then a senior BBC executive, said “why don’t we do this the BBC way?”That consisted of coming up with ideas, and every one we thought worth pursuing would be written on a Post-it and stuck on the wall. Fair enough.After three hours, we’d... covered the wall with Post-its. Our efforts to filter out the duff parts, lines and jokes had come to nothing. If anything we were left with an array of stickie labels, more baffling and complex than anything committed to an actual notebook.I was prompted to think on this, when I read a new study by my good friend, Christopher Saul. Once a top-of-the-tree lawyer, advising many top corporations, Chris went on to become senior partner at his City firm, Slaughter and May. The Slaughters rule is that at the end of their term the senior partner must leave entirely - to stop the successor having to worry about the former senior partner second guessing decisions.Today, Saul is no longer a solicitor but runs his own practice, Christopher Saul Associates, specialising in mediating in business disputes, helping sort out succession issues, and putting companies and organisations right about their governance structures and processes.It’s in that regard that he’s produced a report, The Governance Paradox, analysing the UK’s new Corporate Governance Code, published by the Financial Reporting Council.The first version of the UK Corporate Governance Code, or the Code, as it’s widely known, was published in 1992 by the Cadbury Committee. After a series of major scandals, it was the first serious stab at bringing companies, particularly publicly listed ones, into line, to making them comply with a set of principles, and their accompanying detailed provisions, covering the composition of boards and accounting.Since then the Code has been revised, updated and expanded, with the latest version appearing this summer for implementation in January next year. The new Code is intended to reflect more the age in which we live and in which companies operate, and also comes on the back of further corporate collapses and crises where shareholders, employees, creditors and other stakeholders were seen to suffer.Companies are being required to be seen to be upholding proper, decent values, to devote more attention to their purpose, to their management culture, to pursue ersity, to be more open and inclusive in how they conduct themselves, to pay heed to the interests of their stakeholders, and to focus on the sustainability of the business.The Code is intended to be “shorter and sharper”, according to the FRC. Now Saul is an urbane, thoughtful chap, not given to hyperbole - as you might expect from the ex-senior partner of such an eminent law firm. So, when he says he agrees with that view, but “it clearly increases to a material extent the governance burden on the boards of premium listed companies” - hence “the paradox” in his title - this should set off alarm bells.It’s true, that we want to tackle the decline in public trust in business, prompted to a large part by instances of perceived greed and fat cattery, but we have to be immensely careful. As Saul asks: “Will the higher hurdles and increased disclosures lead to better outcomes? Or will they lead to exactly the box-ticking and pro-forma compliance which the FRC is looking to avoid?”Let me ask another question: when did you last peruse a company annual report? The current crop, thanks to the existing myriad reporting requirements, are hideously long, complex affairs. The governance section alone of a report for one of the larger FTSE100 members is a document worthy of a PhD dissertation in itself. BP’s annual report, for instance, runs to 299 pages - 53 of which concern how the oil company is governed. Tesco‘s, by contrast, is a relatively slim 155 pages, but the retailer still takes 41 pages to explain who sits on its board, what they do, and how much they’re paid.These are giants that can well afford the attendant advisors that produce these vast tomes. Even a much smaller concern like fashion chain Ted Baker, for instance, is obliged to weigh in with an annual report of 122 pages, including 42 pages devoted to governance matters.The FRC is seeking higher quality reporting, but unfortunately the experience to date, in a City heavily populated by lawyers and accountants is to equate quality with quantity. As there’s been a push to raise standards, so have reports become ever bigger.This begs two questions. Will it see more public-owned companies decide they’ve had enough, and choose to go private - this, at a time, when the private equity houses are flush with cash and sniffing for purchases? And, at the very least, will it force non-executive directors to think again? Saul summarises these queries in another: “Have we arrived at governance overload?”By all means lift the bar where corporate behaviour is concerned - we’ve seen far too many examples of appalling executive disdain for others, examples that have done huge harm to how big business in Britain is regarded. But we also need to re-examine what we’re asking of our companies, to see if every item in the Code is necessary, and whether the workload it’s imposing, and the sheer detail (not to mention the pagination) cannot be reduced. We may think we’re moving towards better administration and management of our businesses, when in fact all we’re doing is creating yet more work for lawyers and accountants. As a former leading lawyer himself, Christopher Saul is well-placed to judge.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns and strategic communications advisory firm.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Sales rose 16 per cent to £10.2bn, while profit increased by 29 per cent to £417.3m. The supermarket also reported that customer numbers grew by more than 1.1 million to 15.8 million, giving Aldi a 7.6 per cent market share in the UK.

Savvy customers know they can swap and save with Aldi, thanks to great quality products at lower prices. This is happening on a massive scale, with more than 1.1m new customers shopping with us throughout 2017.“While other grocers introduced more complexity into their businesses in their struggle to win back customers, we stuck to our guns and focused on doing what Aldi does best – buying smart, staying lean, improving quality and keeping prices low.

That still puts the company at a higher price-to-earnings multiple than its only other listed rival Ferrari\u0026nbspwhich has a stronger history of making profits.Shareholders will be cashing out just five months before Brexit which could usher in damaging trade barriers for the UK car industry.Aston Martin moves ahead with stock market float as Volvo shelves IPODespite the price reduction, some existing shareholders will have seen a 10-fold increase in their investment in less than a decade. When private equity firm Investindustrial bought a 37.5 per cent stake in 2012, Aston Martin was valued about £400m.Car manufacturers are expected to be among the hardest hit by Brexit, because they rely on hundreds of parts sourced from across the Continent. Industry figures have warned that any delays at the border or other additional administrative burdens could prove disastrous.But chief executive Andy Palmer said last month that Aston is “well insulated” from problems that could result from the UK crashing out of the EU without a trade deal.“We can demonstrate that Brexit is not a major effect for us,” he said.“If there is a tariff into Europe, it’s countered by a tariff into the UK for our competitors so you might lose a little bit of market share in the EU but you pick it up in the UK.”Aston Martin sells roughly 25 per cent of its cars to the EU and operates its only plant in Britain, with a second one due to begin operations in 2019.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s hard to see growth in manufacturing output recovering until the risk of a no-deal Brexit has been extinguished.”Hit by Brexit uncertaintyThe Office for National Statistics estimated last week that manufacturing, which accounts for around 10 per cent of the UK economy, contracted by 0.7 per cent in the second quarter, following a 0.1 per cent shrinkage in the first three months of the year.This followed a strong performance in 2017, when it is estimated to have grown by 2.6\u0026nbspper cent.A survey of 1,000 companies by the UK Trade Policy Observatory last month found that Brexit had already hit them hard.Almost 30 per cent of those exporting firms who were able to provide data have already lost business directly as a consequence of the vote to leave the EU and a third have already experienced a Brexit-driven fall in investment.Decline in manufacturing output in second quarter of 2018Separately, the Bank of England reported\u0026nbspon Monday that consumer credit growth slowed to a three-year low in August.Borrowing was up 8.1 per cent year on year, the slowest rate since September 2015.However, mortgage approvals picked up to 66,440, slightly ahead of analysts’\u0026nbspexpectations.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

are being wasted because of a “lack of demand” despite near record waiting times in many parts of the country, an investigation has shown.GP leaders warned scarce staff time and millions in NHS funds are being spent manning\u0026nbspsurgeries\u0026nbspto fulfil a “political must-do”.A core health policy in the last two Conservative manifestos is that everyone in England would be able to routinely book GP appointments in the evenings and at weekends.NHS launches app allowing patients to book GP appointments Almost half of GP appointments now involve mental health, survey findsMillions finding it harder to get a GP appointment, new analysis showsThis is already in place in much of the country and the NHS set a deadline of 1 October for every local clinical commissioning group\u0026nbsp(CCGs).But a Freedom of Information Act investigation by the magazine for GPs, Pulse,\u0026nbspfound that between April 2017 and September 2018\u0026nbsphalf a million bookable appointments have gone unused – costing the NHS an estimated £15m.“At a time when general practice is struggling for resources and patients are waiting longer for routine appointments, to find out so many evening and weekend appointments have been unfilled due to lack of demand is shocking,” chair of the Royal College of\u0026nbspGPs, Professor Helen\u0026nbspStokes-Lampard\u0026nbspsaid.Demand was particularly low on Sundays, where 37 per of the appointments available across the country have been left unfilled, the data provided by 80 of the 195\u0026nbspCCGs in England shows.Election promises to make it easier to get GP appointments will beSunday uptake was as low as 3 per cent, in Thanet, Kent however a CCG spokesperson said they would run a publicity campaign to address this and were confident these would all be filled.NHS England said\u0026nbspthe fact that more than half of appointments were filled was a sign of success and said patients were willing to “vote with their feet” for the flexible service they wanted.However,\u0026nbspPulse’s findings from pilot regions that launched the scheme in 201415 show that they are still struggling to fill more than four out of five appointments.NHS\u0026nbspEngland pointed to examples of good uptake, such as in London, where 72 per cent of appointments are now being filled after the scheme\u0027s first 18 months, and Herefordshire,\u0026nbspone of the first to pilot the scheme, where 91 per cent of appointments were filled during one week in August.In 201718 £147m was given to CCGs to fund extended access schemes and this will rise to £500m a year by 202021.“Because it has become a political must-do, everybody is jumping,” said Dr Richard\u0026nbspVautrey, chair of the British Medical Association’s GP Committee.Created with Sketch.NHS at 70: demonstration and celebration march to mark anniversary Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, addresses demonstrators following the marchLabour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, addresses demonstrators following the march“We understand there is huge pressure from the centre on\u0026nbspCCGs\u0026nbspto demonstrate they are providing a full seven-day service,” he said, adding that a “pragmatic” approach was needed in light of current doctor shortages.However, the NHS Patient Survey has shown that millions more patients are reporting difficulty getting a GP appointment, and half of practices report one or more unfilled vacancies.One issue that may be hampering uptake for weekend and evening appointments, despite long waits during the week, is that extended access appointments are typically run from “hubs” serving all the practices in an area.While appointments are routinely bookable, it is less likely that patients will see their local GP and they may have to travel further for treatment.An NHS England spokesperson said: “Despite this small survey of a minority of the country, patients do actually want to be able to see a GP at convenient times, and that includes evenings and weekends.“To suggest that people should always be forced to take time off work if they need to see their GP would be backward step, and as the popularity of new types of online digital primary care shows, patients are increasingly prepared to vote with their feet to get convenient access.”Royal College of GPsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But NOA\u0027s pitch is that it\u0027s not a competition at all, and that audio can be about showing off some of the best traditional journalism in an entirely new setting.While audio is perhaps the oldest of all forms of media, the ways it is being delivered to people isn\u0027t at all. The advent of Amazon\u0027s Alexa, for instance, heralded an entirely new form of listening within the home, favouring on-demand cuts of information that can be requested by shouting while doing the washing up traditional radio still exists but it is increasingly being delivered over the internet when people ask, rather than as traditional broadcast.And the growth of ways to listen has come with an expansion of the listening public, too. With on-demand audio, people have come to see (or hear) that there are various times of the day that go largely unfilled, and it\u0027s apps like NOA – as well as other major audio companies like Audible – that are rushing into stop them being so silent.Amazon Alexa will now listen for strangers in your houseNOA works in a relatively simple way: its team take the best of their partners\u0027 written content, have a narrator record it, and push it out into the world. Its audience can then listen however and whenever they want, simply by opening up the app on their phone or asking Alexa to do it for them.The great thing about it is the time you have each day to consume visual content is limited, says Gareth Hickey, co-founder and CEO at NOA. You might take a quick look at a screen in the morning, and an hour or two in the evening. And that time can be filled up not just with news or other media like on demand television and Netflix, but also social media, emails and WhatsApp.Audio, however, doesn\u0027t have to compete: it can be done while driving, walking, exercising or doing something else entirely, and so can be a complement rather than distraction.About half of NOA\u0027s consumption comes between 7am and 9am. That gap in the day there just gets a lot of traffic – it\u0027s people that are usually commuting.There are of course many companies vying for that time too, many of them new. Everything from the shortest podcast to the longest of Audible\u0027s audiobook is intended to take on that market.But there is an awful lot of that time, too, and it is often spent doing a variety of different things. That means that companies like NOA seeing themselves as complementing podcasts rather than challenging them.That\u0027s useful become some companies like the New York Times have invested heavily in podcasts.They try much own that experience, and they\u0027re doing a great job with that. They\u0027re putting a huge amount of thought and time into getting that right.Instead, NOA focuses on the traditional articles that continue to do so well for those publishers. It is not about the kind of lengthier chats that often make up the meat of podcasts, but rather taking the quality content that news organisations are already producing it and recording it so people can listen to it another way.The style of content that we tend to lean more and more towards is the opinion, analysis, features, he says. The kind of articles that you might come across on a busy Monday afternoon and might not have the time to read.When people do come to those articles, they tend to spend a decent amount of time: about 85 per cent of people coming to an article will finish it, and they\u0027ll stay for an average of four-and-a-half minutes.NOA, of course, has some of the same struggles as every other news publisher. One of them is ensuring that people feel they can make their way through the vast amount of information that\u0027s out there in a way that\u0027s comprehensive and meaningful – without feeling completely overwhelming.One of the things we\u0027re moving towards has been an attempt to bring finish-ability to news topics, he says. It\u0027s all very well reading one piece about Brexit or business or whatever else, but with those huge issues it cane difficult to know where to start or where to end.One approach that NOA has been taking is to gather those topics up into playlists. One about electric cars, for instance, might include a more general overview on the industry, a e into the cobalt shortage that is threatening the batteries that power them, and a look at the latest scandal Tesla and Elon Musk have become embroiled in.It all helps to make people feel like it\u0027s possible to reach the end of the news, even if it\u0027s just to find that some more news has happened. When there is such an often overwhelming amount of stories – and stories about those stories – NOA like other more traditional publishers in seeking ways to cut through the noise.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They were sent back over a distance of around 180 million miles.They come after the space agency successfully landed two rovers on the asteroid, dropping them from a spacecraft floating just above the surface.The rovers dropped down onto the asteroid by the Hayabusa-2 spacecraft are the first mobile exploration robots ever to land on an asteroid\u0027s surface. The images they are sending back are the first time that anything has ever autonomously moved and taken pictures themselves on asteroid, too.One of the pictures includes the shadow of the antenna and pin of the rover itself.​ The pin – which is the long line that can be seen sticking out of the rover – helps increase friction when they engage in the hops that they use to jump around the surface, among other purposes.Jaxa, the Japanese space agency, says that both of the rovers are in good condition and are transmitting images and data. The pictures they are sending back have confirmed that they are moving themselves around the asteroid\u0027s surface.The rovers will spend their time exploring the planet\u0027s surface by being joined by yet another visitor,\u0026nbspcalled Mascot, built by scientists in Germany and France, that will further explore the surface.The new pictures are the second batch to be sent down by the\u0026nbspHayabusa-2 spacecraft. The first were taken as the two rovers tumbled to the surface, and show their whirling motion as they fall.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Absolutely.”The EU sees Brexit talks as Britain’s ‘managed capitulation’The comments are the strongest evidence yet that moderate Tories are flexing their muscles to prevent Theresa May carrying out her threat to allow the UK to crash out of the EU if necessary.Some senior cabinet ministers are also believed to be alarmed that the UK could end up facing a no-deal Brexit “by accident” and want the prime minister to adopt looser, Canada-style\u0026nbsptrade proposals as a fallback.Speaking on ITV’s Peston programme, Ms Rudd warned hardline anti-Brexit Tory MPs that continuing to obstruct Ms May’s efforts to reach an agreement in Brussels could backfire on them.\u0026nbsp“I don’t think no deal will happen,” she said, arguing a Norway-style EEA deal\u0026nbsp– effectively keeping the UK in the EU single market – remained a possibility.And she said: “It would be ironic indeed if we got a people’s vote because the more Brexity people in my party were unable to support the prime minister in her negotiated settlement and then they might not even get their Brexit.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march“So I think they have to think very carefully about the consequences of not supporting a negotiated settlement.”The Independent has launched its Final Say campaign, to give the British people the crucial decision on any Brexit deal.

It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving.\u0026nbsp“The lesson from history is clear: if you turn the EU club into a prison, the desire to get out won’t diminish, it will grow – and we won’t be the only prisoner that will want to escape.”Mr Hunt then invoked Margaret Thatcher’s famous battle cry against EU centralisation, saying: “We understand the EU wants to protect itself.“But if the only way to deal with the UK leaving is to try to force its break-up, as someone much more distinguished than me once said, the answer is ‘No No No’.”And he added: “Let me say one more thing about these talks.

alternative”.The prominent backbencher said that, with the Chequers proposals “dead” and the threat to jobs from crashing out of the EU without a deal, the decision had to be thrown back to the public.Ms Allen blamed Boris Johnson and other Tory right-wingers for killing off Theresa May’s Chequers plan, which now had no chance of approval at Westminster – even if it can be revived in Brussels.Clark insists ‘we need to have a Brexit deal’, contradicting May“They have behaved unacceptably through this and have completely tied her hands,” she said. “It is they who have made Chequers dead.”She then added: “That being the case, then I think that it is the end of the road, which is very disappointing and for me leaves us with no alternative.“Should we come to that and no deal ... then we need to go back to the public to decide what they want us to do next.”Crucially, Ms Allen said the option of staying in the EU under existing terms would have to be on the ballot paper.She told BBC Radio 4 that she would still support in principle an “11th hour” deal hammered out by the prime minister but that it was now clear many in her party would not.Her comments came as the Conservative faithful gather in Birmingham for the party’s annual conference and after Mr Johnson’s latest broadside against the prime minister’s negotiating stance.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s

After gaining its independence in 1990 it sought EU membership, finally joining in 2004 after an overwhelming referendum result.Hunt likens EU to Soviet Russia and vows to \u0027fight\u0027 for BrexitA string of senior British diplomats also condemned Mr Hunt’s comments. Lord Ricketts, a former head of the Foreign Office, said Mr Hunt’s claim was “rubbish unworthy of a British Foreign Secretary”.The peer’s successor as Britain’s chief diplomat, Simon Fraser, said he agreed with his predecessor and that the Foreign Secretary had displayed a “shocking failure of judgement”.Responding to a journalist reporting Mr Hunt’s words on social media, Latvian ambassador Mr Braže said: “Just for your information - Soviets killed, deported, exiled and imprisoned hundreds of thousands of Latvia\u0027s inhabitants after the illegal occupation in 1940, and ruined lives of three generations, while the EU has brought prosperity, equality, growth, respect.”Former Latvian president Andris K. Berzins also appeared troubled by the speech, re-posting a comment stating that Mr Hunt’s words were “repulsive and below him”.Just for your information - Soviets killed, deported, exiled and imprisoned hundreds of thousands of Latvia\u0027s inhabitants after the illegal occupation in 1940, and ruined lives of three generations, while the EU has brought prosperity, equality, growth, respect.The comments are likely to cause widespread anger across the EU at a time in talks when Britain desperately needs allies on the European Council. Donald Tusk, the president of the body, was active as an anti-Soviet student leader in Gdańsk under Poland’s communist government – at the time a client state of the USSR.Mr Tusk himself has said that the “tough and in fact uncompromising” stance struck by the British Government, in particular Theresa May, had pushed EU leaders into hardening their own position and rejecting outright her Chequers Brexit trade plan.Mr Hunt had told conference delegates: “What happened to the confidence and ideals of the European dream? The EU was set up to protect freedom. It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

It’s hard to see growth in manufacturing output recovering until the risk of a no-deal Brexit has been extinguished.”Hit by Brexit uncertaintyThe Office for National Statistics estimated last week that manufacturing, which accounts for around 10 per cent of the UK economy, contracted by 0.7 per cent in the second quarter, following a 0.1 per cent shrinkage in the first three months of the year.This followed a strong performance in 2017, when it is estimated to have grown by 2.6\u0026nbspper cent.A survey of 1,000 companies by the UK Trade Policy Observatory last month found that Brexit had already hit them hard.Almost 30 per cent of those exporting firms who were able to provide data have already lost business directly as a consequence of the vote to leave the EU and a third have already experienced a Brexit-driven fall in investment.Decline in manufacturing output in second quarter of 2018Separately, the Bank of England reported\u0026nbspon Monday that consumer credit growth slowed to a three-year low in August.Borrowing was up 8.1 per cent year on year, the slowest rate since September 2015.However, mortgage approvals picked up to 66,440, slightly ahead of analysts’\u0026nbspexpectations.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

A year on, with\u0026nbspimages of baton-wielding policemen charging at polling stations fading in memories, a long-lasting political solution has yet to take shape.(Weeks later, on 27 October, the Catalan parliament declared independence but was dissolved when Madrid\u0026nbspinvoked the article 155 of Spain’s constitution for the first time and imposed direct rule.)The arrival of new heads of government has allowed something of a thaw in political relations – with Socialist\u0026nbspPedro Sánchez\u0026nbsptaking over from the centre-right\u0026nbspMariano Rajoy\u0026nbspin Madrid, while\u0026nbspCatalonia’s\u0026nbspruling Nationalists have a new leader in\u0026nbsphardline\u0026nbspRepublican Quim Torra,But the underlying pessimism remains. According to a late-September poll by scopia,\u0026nbsp69 per cent of Spaniards consider\u0026nbspthe political situation in Catalonia to be worse than last year only 15 per cent believe\u0026nbspit has\u0026nbspimproved.Why does Catalonia want independence?“The Socialists’ willingness to hold meetings with the Nationalists and deal with some long-running budget questions and investments has definitely provided some oxygen in an atmosphere which, under the previous Partido Popular government, was simply asphyxiating,” says Germà Capdevila, a longstanding political analyst for L’Esguard magazine and online Catalan daily NacioDigital.“But the change of climate hasn’t produced a real change of positions.”“The Catalan government continues to demand a referendum or an advance towards a republic and the state government continues to say such questions cannot even be discussed, let alone negotiated.”Created with Sketch.Catalonia civil disobedience on 8 August – in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Demonstrators block a highway during a general strike in Borrassa, near Girona, CataloniaProtesters block a track in in Sant Cugat del Valles Catalan regional policemen (Mossos d\u0027Esquadra) drag a picketer blocking the street at the North Bus Station in Barcelona as part of a regionwide strike called by a pro-independence union Catalan regional policemen (Mossos d\u0027Esquadra) drag a picketer blocking the street at the North Bus Station in Barcelona Protesters block a road in BarcelonaA person paints the word Freedom on a wall as protesters blocked a ring road in Barcelona during a partial regional strike called by pro-independence parties and labour unionsPolice remove a protestor who was part of a group blocking a ring roadA driver argues with demonstrators blocking a highway during the general strike in BarcelonaPolice remove protestors blocking a ring road in BarcelonaDemonstrators get ready to block a highway during the general strike in BarcelonaDemonstrators block a highway during a general strike in Borrassa, near Girona, CataloniaProtesters block a track in in Sant Cugat del Valles Catalan regional policemen (Mossos d\u0027Esquadra) drag a picketer blocking the street at the North Bus Station in Barcelona as part of a regionwide strike called by a pro-independence union Catalan regional policemen (Mossos d\u0027Esquadra) drag a picketer blocking the street at the North Bus Station in Barcelona Protesters block a road in BarcelonaA person paints the word Freedom on a wall as protesters blocked a ring road in Barcelona during a partial regional strike called by pro-independence parties and labour unionsPolice remove a protestor who was part of a group blocking a ring roadA driver argues with demonstrators blocking a highway during the general strike in BarcelonaPolice remove protestors blocking a ring road in BarcelonaDemonstrators get ready to block a highway during the general strike in Barcelona“The problem has turned chronic because there is no real will for dialogue on either side,” believes Juan José López Burniol, lawyer and political columnist for La Vanguardia, Catalonia’s biggest newspaper.“Catalonia certainly does not have the strength for unilateral independence\u0026nbspbut it has a massive ability to destabilise the whole of Spain.”Polls in Catalonia confirm the ongoing stalemate, with no clear majority either in favour or against remaining in Spain.Yet while\u0026nbspnationalist parties squabble to the point where the regional parliament was suspended for 70 days this summer because of their infighting, the Republican movement has shown no sign of losing its power to mobilise its grassroots supporters.Hundreds of thousands to join Catalonia independence rallyAround a million pro-independence supporters gathered on 11 September for Catalonia’s most important national day, the Diada, roughly the same as last year.On\u0026nbspSunday evening across Catalonia, demonstrations were being held to commemorate the referendum.The referendum marked a watershed in political life, says Xavier Diez, a teacher and writer on Catalan modern history, “because a large number of people, even those who were not ‘independentist’, saw what happened. If you are attacked for going to vote, that affects you.”A likely start date in January for the trials of those jailed for their role in the 1 October\u0026nbspreferendum will continue to maintain the pro-separatist parties’ momentum through the winter.“If the prisoners faced a normal series of charges for civil disobedience, rather than distorting it with charges of rebellion with violence, that would help defuse things”, believes Mr\u0026nbspCapdevila, “firstly because they would probably be released, and secondly because calling it rebellion with violence makes an agreement much more difficult.”Catalonia elects hardline separatist as new regional presidentCurrently, though, the question of how the agenda will be moved forward on either side is much harder to see. Direct rule from Madrid, hugely unpopular in Catalonia, was ended last winter, but Mr\u0026nbspSanchez has warned it will return if there are any attempts to move towards unilateral independence.“If I was a Spanish politician and I wanted to improve the situation in Catalonia, my career would probably be over,” adds Mr\u0026nbspDiez.As for the Nationalists, “their big error last year was believing that in the Europe of the 21st century, Spain would not be prepared to accept the damage to its international image in return for its continuing unity,” says Mr\u0026nbspCapdevila.Germany will not extradite Catalonia\u0027s Puigdemont on rebellion chargesCatalonia postpones vote for new headSpanish supreme court refuses to release jailed Catalan politicianThe consequences of such a longstanding, ongoing confrontation are deep isions, but even the nature of those isions are the subject of much debate.“The more urban part of Catalonia is more erse and the rural part more singularly Catalan,” says Mr Lopez, who argues that the split has been partly fostered by the separatist movement, but that “the actions of the central government, particularly the era when Mariano Rajoy led it, have caused the problem to stagnate.

It’s crashed and burned.WE hope the poll revealing voters in ­marginal seats deserting the Tories over sky-high rents is enough to stir the ­Government from its paralysis.The Tories are consumed by Brexit.But away from that they must wake up and present radical ideas to beat ­Corbyn’s, especially on housing.They have an advantage.Theirs are more likely to be sane.And vanishingly less likely to put hundreds of thousands on the dole.But Theresa May must realise that voters have more pressing problems than Brexit which could cost her power.Next week the Tories must have a new story to tell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris Johnson will draw a big crowd for his “Chuck Chequers” rally.But there is a bigger danger waiting in the wings for the Tories: They simply don’t have a domestic agenda big enough for the moment.Labour has, over the past few days, set out its vision for Britain. It is, in places, scary. But give Jeremy Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell this, it is undoubtedly clear and bold. As one Cabinet minister says, half admiringly:  “They’re hungry.”The Tories need to show  they have a better plan, one that will deal with people’s concerns— and they don’t have any time to waste. As one minister warns: “I’m just really terried. People don’t realise what a big deal this is.”The Tory Party’s problem is that it isn’t giving the country a vision of where it wants to take it. One former party leader has taken to lamenting that the Tories have “lost the narrative”.At conference last year, Theresa May declared that it was her mission to solve the housing crisis, to restore the British dream of home ownership for the many.But in the past 12 months, the Government has made far too little progress on this. Yes, some sensible steps have been taken. But the policies that will really solve this crisis, proper planning reform and a massive, Government-led housebuilding programme, haven’t happened.The result of all this: Jeremy Corbyn gets closer to power. As this newspaper revealed yesterday, Labour is now ahead in the seats that decide general elections thanks to its massive lead among renters.The likelihood of someone in their late twenties or early thirties on an average salary owning their own home has halved in the past 20 years.This is an electoral time bomb for the Tories. They can’t expect those without capital, or any prospect of getting it, to be capitalists.By the time of the next election, the Tories need to show people that their lives are getting better AND explain the damage  Corbyn would do to the country.One minister points the finger of blame at Number 10 for the Tory predicament. “A fish rots from the head down,” he tells me. But the Cabinet can’t escape its share of the blame, either.With a few exceptions, min­isters aren’t doing enough to take on Labour’s arguments. As one former Secretary of State fumed to me during Labour conference: “It’s outrageous. Where are the Cabinet?”If the Tories get Brexit wrong, it could cost them the next election. But even  they get a decent deal, it won’t guarantee them victory. For the public will vote on domestic issues — whether the housing crisis is solved, the state of the health service and what is going on with schools.Corbyn has simple answers to all these questions: They might be wrong, but they are answers. The Tories now need to show the country  they have answers too.AT last, some positivity and optimism about this country’s post-Brexit future from the Government.I can reveal  it is planning a major new festival celebrating the UK for 2022. The aim is for this festival to tell the world a story about Britain as we leave the EU and take charge of our own future. It is meant to coincide with the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee and the Commonwealth Games, which will be held in Birmingham that year.Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright,  who is pushing this idea in Whitehall, has told colleagues  it will be: “Future-facing, telling a story about the UK’s unique strengths, particularly as a place to invest, as we forge a new future outside the European Union.”If the Government gets it right, this festival could be a great statement about the open, dynamic country that Britain is going to be after Brexit. It should emphasise how this country is going out into the world after leaving the EU, not pulling up the drawbridge.The aim should be to put on something that stands comparison with the great post-war Festival of Britain in 1951 or even the Great Exhibition of 1851, which showcased Victorian Britain’s global reach and technological edge.One Secretary of State, who is backing the idea, tells me: “People just want something really positive.”But cynics might note that there is an advantage for the Tories in a feel-good festival in an election year.But I understand he will  have a harsh message for the Westminster politicians in attendance. He will  tell them to stop bickering and positioning and get on with delivering for the country.Mr Street will say that outside the Westminster bubble, the public just want politicians to get on with things, rather than constantly jostling for position.What makes his  speech so interesting is that he is a Downing Street favourite. Indeed, I understand  some of those close to Theresa May are pushing for a similar tone in her speech.They believe  her post-Salzburg speech went down so well with the public not just because she was standing up to the EU but because she was taking charge and being that “bloody dficult woman”. They think she should use her speech to tell members  they won’t get everything  they want from the Brexit talks, but that she will get the best deal for Britain.Others, though, are wary of this approach. One Cabinet minister cautions that after last year, May should play it safe as “you can’t have two bad years  in a row”.THE Government has rightly guaranteed that the three million EU citizens living in Britain will be able to stay in the event of no deal.This is sensible. These citizens contribute a lot to this country, and help keep our economy and our public services moving.But it is also right that the Government is now discussing what the rules will be for deporting EU citizens who commit crimes after Brexit in a no-deal scenario.The details have not yet been decided and, as one government source puts it: “No one wants people deported for getting a parking ticket.”But it is right that those who are convicted of a signicant offence are removed.• SPOT the leadership bid will be one of the games  the Tories play in Birmingham.Any Cabinet minister who starts talking about their childhood will be accused of planning a run for the top job.  This leaves ministers walking a tightrope as they prepare their speeches. Some are dealing with this challenge by handing their time  to others.Penny Mordaunt, the Aid Secretary, is simply introducing a series of “British heroes” who do development work.But one of those involved in conference planning suspects that even this is about leadership as Mordaunt “doesn’t want to spend 45 minutes defending the aid budget to a hall of Tory activists”.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And what is amazing to me is how often people try to wriggle out of things and deny a decision they made, in a bid to stay in the process. So when they sit in the boardroom saying, “I didn’t . . . ” we can say, “Oh yes you did . . . ”Some people ask me  certain scenes are staged, but the show is unique in that there are no retakes, there is no setting up of scenes and no trying to find the comedy moment — they just come naturally.All of Alan’s jokes come naturally, too. There is no script, no autocue, it happens as it happens.Luckily, we get on very well — Claude, Alan and I. So much so that we all went on holiday together this year.We’re all quite similar, we have all been married for a long time and we all share the same family values.It makes us a watertight team, although we each bring something dferent to the table.But, parking that for a moment, The Apprentice is also top-notch entertainment — this series more than ever. What’s great about the first episode is that the contestants, all of whom talk the talk about how fantastic they are, are thrown into the deep end with a task that’s designed to test their logic.They are sent on what is a bit like a treasure hunt, in Malta, armed only with a map and some euros.This task is all about logistics, negotiation and identying, and let’s say it doesn’t end well.It turns out that, unfortunately, logic is not something all the contestants are in possession of.During this series we will travel all over the country, including to Glasgow to sell emerging artists’ work to the unsuspecting public.When I say that task was more challenging than ever, I’m referring partly to the challenge of actually getting to Glasgow because it was during the storms. Remember them?Turbulence was an under-statement. On the flight there, I was gritting my teeth and grabbing on to Claude like there was no tomorrow.One thing I love about the show is that there are equal numbers of men and women, and they are on a level playing field.Let’s face it, the same cannot be said out there in the “real” world.One thing I’ve been reflecting on over the course of my time on The Apprentice is how much things have changed for women in business since I started out.When I was having my kids 22 years ago, the very notion of “work-le balance” didn’t exist. But I’m pleased to say that working women aren’t trying to Have It All any more, and the days are gone when women feel the need to keep quiet about having kids at work.Women are now more able to demand flexible working and feel entitled to have time off for, say, ante-natal classes.More “mumpreneurs” are starting their own businesses. Still, you rarely catch working mothers using childcare as a reason for being absent from work — while men, I’ve noticed, almost get points for doing so.And it is still the case that working mothers and women working flexibly are less likely to be promoted.So I don’t quite agree with Ann Widdecombe, the former Tory MP, who wrote this week that women today have “never had it so good” yet still “whinge” about inequality.Because while it might be true that things have changed for the better, most CEOs are still male.Women might never have had it so good but it’s still not good enough — and it’s not “whingeing” to point that out.HONESTLY, watching Jeremy Corbyn forgetting Labour’s six tests for a Brexit deal, when interviewed by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, was like watching a hapless buffoon.No wonder he got two Es at A-level.This is the leader of the party that makes it up as it goes along – buying votes, promising everyone everything . . . and delivering absoutely nothing.As Margaret Thatcher said, The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people’s money.HERE, The Apprentice star Karren picks out some highlights to look forward to during the show’s new season . . .Wyatt said: “Bill Cosby is doing great . . . Mr Cosby knows that God is watching over him . . . he knows that these are lies.“They persecuted Jesus and look what happened . . .  I’m not saying Mr Cosby is Jesus, but we know what this country has done to black men for centuries.”Just to be clear, Cosby’s conviction has nothing to do with race.The man is accused of rape and drug-facilitated sexual assault, by an astonishing 60 women . . . of all races and ages including some as young as 17.He has finally been put in prison and his victims have justice. He is a vile rapist, a violent sexual predator.His sentence is based on his crimes, not his colour.Unlike Cosby – a “disgusting sexual deviant” according to one of his victims – Jesus was innocent of the crimes laid against him.Cosby, meanwhile, has admitted to giving sedatives to young women in order to have sex with them.In short, Cosby admits his crimes, the jury find him guilty and the judge sentences him.Attempts to make this out as a racial issue are simply ridiculous.I KNOW it’s hard for men to face up to losing their hair, but someone needs to tell David Beckham that by far the best approach when it happens is . . . acceptance.But, judging from the photos of him looking a bit like a smiling Brillo pad this week that is not the route he is taking.David,  you are reading this, you are a handsome man and no one cares  you have a thick head of hair or not – please don’t turn into Shane Warne.I guess the reality star has yet to realise no one is forcing her to go out.She just needs to learn the power of saying no.In the past, I had a dreadful habit of saying yes to an engagement when I meant no, then spent days trying to think of ways to get out of it.I completely changed my le when I decided to simply things by saying yes to an invitation when I wanted to go – and no when I didn’t.IT’S hard to believe not only that West Midlands Police are allowing “thrill-seekers” to spend Halloween in a cell used by serial murderer Fred West – but that they are charging them £75 to do so.Offering this “spooky ghost hunt” at the notorious Steelhouse Lane cells in Birmingham is in very poor taste – so disrespectful of West’s victims, including his daughter who is a surviving casualty of his and is clearly still suffering every day.No doubt the relatives of those West murdered still suffer every day, too.So the fact that a stay in his old prison cell is being offered as Halloween entertainment is positively ghoulish.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The EU was set up to protect freedom. It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving.“The lesson from history is clear:  you turn the EU club into a prison, the desire to get out won’t diminish, it will grow - and we won’t be the only prisoner that will want to escape.“If you reject the hand of friendship offered by our Prime Minister you turn your back on the partnership that has given Europe more security, more freedom and more opportunities than ever in history.“And a setback for the EU will become a wholly avoidable tragedy for Europe.”Quoting Margaret Thatcher, he added: “We understand the EU wants to protect itself.

He believes in control.Tories need to be fair but also free, she stressed - and the party should make sure normal people have the economic freedom to control their own cash as much as possible. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The EU was set up to protect freedom.“It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving.Mr Hunt also issued a plea for warring Tory factions to come together and end their Brexit civil war.He added: “We can only unite the country  we are united ourselves. In Parliament. In the Government. And in the Cabinet”.Meanwhile hardline backbench Tory Brexiteers put on a concerted show of strength last night hinting they could oust the PM  she did not change her Chequers plan.Boris’s close ally Conor Burns took direct aim, warning: I say to the Prime Minister - we dont want to change you, we want you to change the policy of Chequers.And he urged her to please, please adopt a Canada style trade deal instead, suggesting the affection he held for the PM was at breaking point.And he was backed at the Brexit Central website rally by Jacob Rees Mogg, who said Chequers was “not only a dying duck in a thunderstorm, it’s the deadest dying duck in a thunderstorm.And he blasted campaigners for a so-called Peoples Vote, comparing them to Chinese communist and Libyan tyrant Gaddafi.He said: Once you put peoples in the title it is not true, it is about the elite, about those in charge and we should be very careful about that.A former Defence Minister also accused the PM of behaving like scheming Italian prince Machivelli and risked sending betrayed Tory voters into a political wilderness.Mark Francois - who served as Conservative frontbencher for 10 years - told The Sun the Chequers plan looks like “some Machiavellian process or series of backstairs deals” that has “sought to overturn their clearly expressed decision”.And he said the political weather meant those Brexit-loving Tory voters would be left homeless and may never vote again.A study yesterday revealed that Brexit is already costing the public purse £500m a week.The Centre for European Reform’s analysis found the UK economy is already 2.5% smaller than it would have been had Remain won the referendum.But in an attempt at a Brexit boost, ministers announced that the UK will host a nationwide Festival of Britain \u0026amp Northern Ireland in 2022.FORMER Labour Minister Digby Jones warned pro-business Tories must unite as “Jeremy Corbyn is to wealth creation what Diane Abbott is to mathematics”.SCOTS Tory MP Ross Thomson savaged the one word conference slogan “OPPORTUNITY”, raging: “I couldn’t help thinking of the other words ‘missed’, ‘lost’, ‘wasted’ and ‘squandered’.”TRANSPORT boss Chris Grayling’s own train to Birmingham was late — but he was spotted passing the time playing FarmVille on his phone rather than working.FORMER Remainer Jeremy Hunt delighted the Leave-backing party faithful by comparing the EU to the Soviet Union and then channelling Maggie Thatcher by telling Brussels “no, no, no”.TORY Peter Bone said ex-Ukip boss Nigel Farage should be made a Lord and put in charge of Brexit, adding: “If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody is hoping for voter-friendly treats.For a man in charge of our economic destiny at such a momentous time, this “stubby-pencilled accountant” has precious little to say. It seems he even remained mute at a recent Cabinet session to war-game a No-Deal Brexit — surely the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s special subject.Well-informed Spectator editor Fraser Nelson says other ministers piled in with upbeat projects but Hammond “seemed to have no ideas and kept quiet”. Spreadsheet Phil possesses either supreme self-confidence or total contempt for the 17.4million who voted for Brexit, or both.The man who a year ago faced political death has become the most powerful figure in Theresa May’s Cabinet — perhaps including herself.She remains the figurehead. But the minister she planned to axe until her botched General Election is running the Brexit show from his Treasury eyrie.Hammond’s sympathetic image as Eeyore, a woebegone soft toy, is misleading. This man combines thin-skinned arrogance with a rare combination of political disabilities — cloth-eared, ham-fisted and leaden-footed.The grey image of bungled Budgets and barren creativity stands in vivid contrast to his outrageous Project Fear scaremongering. Mrs May certainly deserves blame for her hapless EU negotiations and the mutant Chequers plan for a Hi-Ho  Brexit.THE Tories have made a decent start to their conference – but they need to set their ambitions higher.Last week the Labour Party promised easy answers on everything from housing to the economy. It was a radical,  utterly disastrous, vision for Britain.The Government changing tipping rules and increasing taxes on foreign property buyers is pretty small beer.Not least since the former was first announced three years ago and the latter is pretty much copied from last year’s Labour manesto.Philip Hammond — rarely mistaken for a ray of sunshine — needs to provide light at the end of the austerity tunnel.He must lay the groundwork for entrepreneurs to thrive in a newly liberated, unapologetically free market economy.And he should challenge business to work with him, too. The self-appointed “voices of British business”, iniably dominated by large corporate interests, push every day for more and more Brexit concessions.Yet as last week showed, Labour’s unreconstructed Marxism is a far more serious threat to future prosperity than any kind of Brexit.It’s time for big businesses to play their part in building a better Britain, rather than refighting a referendum which was as much a vote against them as the political establishment.Eeyore Hammond must encourage them to invest in Britain’s future.She survived last year’s election catastrophe only because Remainers feared a true Brexiteer such as Boris Johnson might replace her.Hammond has since deployed his Treasury reach to capitalise on her weakness and box us into BRINO — Brexit In Name Only. Mrs May is the willing captive of passionate Remainers in Downing Street, Whitehall, the Cabinet Office and, crucially, the all-powerful Treasury.Since the departure of close aide Nick Timothy, there is nobody within earshot who voted Brexit — including Mrs May. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, like his predecessor David Davis, has virtually no say in negotiations.Hammond now calls the shots, backed by panic-stirring Business Secretary Greg Clark and Europhile Cabinet Office minister David Lidington.Brexiteers fear this Unholy Trinity is ready for more concessions over issues including migration, EU benefits and Britain’s vital financial services industry.Never forget, it was Hammond who blocked all spending and therefore all serious preparation for No Deal, a prospect now apparently facing this nation. In fact there was never a chance of No Deal.We will end up with a form of Chequers, but one even more pro-Brussels than the proposal which saw David Davis and BoJo storm out. Remainers are back in full Project Fear mode.European car firms are happily pouring billions into Britain — despite Brexit. Yet Greg Clark triggered last week’s chorus of fake alarm from Toyota, claiming its “just-in-time” supply chain would grind to a halt.This ignores the whole point of “just-in-time”. It is designed specically to cope with delivery glitches and operates worldwide in all circumstances under global trade rules.It was also Clark who handed Brussels its biggest anti-Brexit card by promising those shroud-waving car giants the UK would remain under EU rules. That led directly to Mrs May’s surrender over the Northern Ireland border, which has plagued negotiations ever since.It is a tragic fact — but no surprise — that we are now heading remorselessly for a deal on EU terms at our expense.EU leaders were never going to see us thrive outside. They insisted we will not be better off after Brexit.Anyone who hoped we might be set free to compete on equal terms should read ex-Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis’ story of his own country’s punishment beating.It was Varoufakis who compared Brexit with the Eagles’ hit: “It’s like Hotel Calornia — you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.” And we can blame Phil Hammond for blocking the fire Brexits.But Ms Jourova, a Czech raised under Soviet rule, wants Corbyn-style “regulation” of the free Press.The apple never falls far from the tree.PS.

She died in hospital in Nice.At last week’s inquest coroner Sean Cummings slammed Pret for failing to alert customers to potentially fatal allergens.Pret was warned nine times about the dangers of sesame in its artisan baguettes in the year before Natasha died.Colquhoun, 34, who has a shellfish allergy, claimed that when he asked the company’s chief executive Clive Schlee to put labels on Pret’s food the boss told him he wouldn’t sanction adding labels because he didn’t want the outlets looking like stationery shops.Colquhoun says the Pret boss made the remarks to him in March 2012 after he says his throat closed up when he was eating at a Pret outlet in Cambridge and tucked into a wrap that claimed to be an “avocado salad wrap ”.But Colquhoun says it contained prawn.Even Pret a Manger is still using the loophole, with no warnings on packets. The law says that when food is prepared onsite, ingredient labelling is not necessary.It is designed to protect small, independent stores.At the busy shops we investigated – EAT, Pret, Wasabi and itsu at Canary Wharf Shopping Mall in East London – allergy information signs were in cabinets, urging customers to ask.But at Greggs in Chrisp Street Market no signs were visible — despite assurances from chiefs that allergy signs were there.Every shop we visited failed to feature any information on packaging for food made in-house.A spokeswoman for Pret responded to Mr Colquhouns claims: “We are very sorry for Chip’s experience, and will be contacting him to apologise.“We have made improvements to the way we provide allergen information, and we know there is much more to do.”Schlee issued a statement on Friday after the coroners ruling: “We are deeply sorry for Natasha’s death. We cannot begin to comprehend the pain her family have gone through and the grief they continue to feel.We have heard everything the Coroner and Natasha’s family have said this week. And we will learn from this.All of us at Pret want to see meaningful change come from this tragedy. We will make sure that it does.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000430401988.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"judge praises homeowner burglars ormskirk lancashire","story":"David Oldham, 63, was congratulated after he bravely attacked burglar Craig Ford, 25, and his accomplice after finding them on his property in Ormskirk, Lancs.Ford’s blood was left on Mr Oldham’s clothing - helping later identy him - following the incident on April 5 at the £400,000 detached house.Derek Jones, prosecuting, told Liverpool crown court that at the time of the burglary Ford was already on licence from a three year sentence imposed in 2016.He told the court that Mr Oldham was home when he heard noises and looking out he saw Ford who had his coat zipped up with his hood down and looking upwards.He said: “Mr Oldham, a man of some substance, bravely went out to the side of the property and was confronted by the defendant who moved towards him.Fearing for his safety he punched him once to the face which knocked him to the floor and also knocked a tooth out.”The other intruder then jumped down from the roof landing in front of Mr Oldham who instinctively punched him to the face causing him to stumble backwards.Ford then told his pal “Shoot him, he’s knocked my teeth out” before telling Mr Oldham they would flee  he let them go.Four months later Ford was bitten by a police dog as he resisted arrest.Jailing the burglar on Friday for three years and four months, Judge Clement Goldstone, QC, the Recorder of Liverpool, said: “You’ve learnt two lessons I hope.One is you do not mess with David Oldham and, two, you don’t mess with the police.“I’m delighted to say that for your pains in committing these offences you now have one tooth less than you had before and you got bitten by a dog.

Why couldnt they have sorted this sooner?Another added: My daughter is unhappy in herself due to not being able to mix with her friends in the yard at play time. Why are children in Llanfairfechan being treated like second class citizens?Now school governors and council officials are arguing over who should foot the repair bill.Conwy Council initially said the school had reserved funding it can use, before later pledging to pay whatever is left over.But school governors say its the councils responsibility as the bill would leave them struggling to pay staff.Sun Online has contacted the school and council to explain how the work should be funded.A letter that was sent home to parents about the playground yesterday states: The surface has steadily deteriorated over the past four years and related accidents increased to such an extent that the board governors and the headmaster made a joint decision, over the summer break, to close it until it can be resurfaced.The decision was not taken lightly but our duty of care to both pupils and staff has been our primary concern.The area will be resurfaced during October half term and the yard will be re-opened on  to school on November 5.The cost of the resurfacing is going to be substantial and we are currently in protracted negotiations with Conwy Council regarding how we are going to fund this work.We will also need to fund raise ourselves in order to pay for some of the work that needs to be done.A Conwy Council spokeswoman told the newspaper: In common with other local authorities in Wales, Conwy Council is suffering severe cuts in funding, which means it can’t do all that it would wish to do.Some schools, however, maintain high levels of reserves - at the end of the 2017/18 financial year Ysgol Pant y Rhedyn had reserves in excess of £70,000.This meant the school had not spent 13 per cent of its allocation. This is money that could and should be spent on the education of pupils and their learning environment. She added: We understand the school has now made arrangements for the yard to be resurfaced during October half term.

In his keynote speech to the Conservative conference in Birmingham, Mr Hunt accused Brussels of seeking to punish Britain for wanting to leave the EU and compared it to the Soviet Union trying to stop its citizens leaving.  The comment was denounced as unworthy of a British Foreign Secretary by the former head of Foreign Office civil servants Lord Ricketts, while his successor as Permanent Secretary Sir Simon Fraser described it as a shocking failure of judgment.  Meanwhile, Latvia\u0027s ambassador to the UK retorted that the EU had brought her country prosperity, equality, growth, respect after decades in which the Soviet Union ruined the lives of its people. In his speech on Sunday, the Foreign Secretary recalled a visit to Latvia, during which he observed how the Baltic state had developed into a modern democracy, part of both NATO and the EU after breaking free of the Soviet Union. And he asked: What happened to the confidence and ideals of the European dream? The EU was set up to protect freedom. It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving.  The lesson from history is clear:  you turn the EU club into a prison, the desire to get out won\u0027t diminish it will grow, and we won\u0027t be the only prisoner that will want to escape.   Lord Ricketts, who was the Foreign Office\u0027s most senior civil servant from 2006-10 before serving as National Security Adviser and ambassador to France, responded on Twitter: This rubbish is unworthy of a British Foreign Secretary.  The EU isn\u0027t a Soviet-style prison. Its legal order has brought peace and prosperity after a century of war. Our decision to leave was always going to leave us worse off. The only punishment is the self-inflicted iety. And Sir Simon Fraser, who led Britain\u0027s diplomats from 2010-15 and is now vice-chair of foreign affairs think-tank Chatham House, said: I agree with Lord Ricketts, my predecessor as Permanent Secretary. Whatever you think about Brexit, shocking failure of judgement for British Foreign Secretary to compare European Union with Soviet Union.  Latvian ambassador Baiba Braze said: Soviets killed, deported, exiled and imprisoned 100 thousands of Latvia\u0027s inhabitants after the illegal occupation in 1940, and ruined lives of 3 generations, while the EU has brought prosperity, equality, growth, respect. Ms Braze later appeared to play down any rt with Mr Hunt, sending a second tweet thanking him for his warm words and memories about his visit to Latvia and UK\u0027s contribution to our freedom in his speech.

Insulting other people is not the way I want my country represented and the public see it for what it is, petty politics.” He went on to declare Theresa May’s Chequers deal “the deadest of dead ducks in thunderstorms.” Speaking at a rally organised by pro-Brexit website Brexit Central, Mr Rees-Mogg said: “I went to Chequers once. “I went to Chequers when Ted Heath was Prime Minister.

The University of Brighton allowed the Sex Workers\u0027 Outreach Project  to run a stall at its Freshers\u0027 Fair on Tuesday and Thursday.  It offered students advice on how to become a sex worker, and gave out free condoms and lube.  The stand also invited students to play on the \u0027wheel of sexual wellbeing\u0027 - and prizes included underwear. SWOP describes itself as a \u0027discreet and confidential trans inclusive service for women working in the sex industry who live or work in Sussex.  It also put out a series of tweets, including: If you\u0027re topping up your fees with sex work, or struggling to balance work and studies, or want to talk and don\u0027t know where to go... We\u0027re here for you. We respect your autonomy, privacy and confidentiality. The group publishes leaflets and tips on how to be a prostitute, reassuring those who are considering it. It says: You cannot be prosecuted for just selling sex... it is not illegal to work as an escort or to sell sexual services.  Among critics of the idea was feminist campaigner and writer Julie Bindel, the co-founder of the law reform group Justice for Women. She said: This is beyond disgraceful. It makes me so angry that the sex trade\u0027s become normalised and pimped to women as though it is a harmless and respectable way to earn a living. There should be an enquiry by the university into this. Others took to twitter to express their disgust. One wrote: What the ****? Are you seriously encouraging young people to sell their bodies to fund university? Sex work? Do you mention this to prospective parents and their parents at open days.  But the university\u0027s union says people have got the wrong end of the stick.

Chris Lewis, from the Rhondda in Wales - who\u0027s known as Curly because of his corkscrew locks - has been running the hugely popular Curlys Dinners for the past 14 years. Claiming to be the first Sunday dinner delivery service in the Rhondda, the company specialises in takeaway roasts, served in a polystyrene tray. Costing between \u0026pound4.50 for children and \u0026pound6.50 for adults, each portion comes with a choice of meat, vegetables, roast potatoes, stuffing, Yorkshire pudding and a pot of Curly\u0027s popular homemade gravy. There\u0027s also a choice of homemade desserts, like jam roly-poly and custard or chocolate fudge cake and cream, which start from around \u0026pound1.50. Facebook reviews rate the dinners as 4.8 out of 5, with many reviewers describing the food as beautul, fantastic, good value for money and the best Sunday dinner I\u0027ve ever tasted.  Despite only opening the shop on a Sunday, preparation work starts as early as Friday for Chris and his team, as they get ready for the weekend ahead. We prep all week - Friday we have our deliveries, Saturday we prepare the food, Sunday we\u0027re flat out all day, 43-year-old Chris, a former pub chef, told Wales Online . Starting at an eye-wateringly early 5am, Chris then works constantly until around 4pm on a Sunday. He estimates that his team - which is made up of around eight staff members - prepare, cook and sell between 350 and 380 roast dinners, as well as a number of desserts, every week. This means the company could potentially be making upwards of around \u0026pound28,000 a year JUST by opening on a Sunday. I can manage enough on a Sunday to be closed the rest of the week, Chris said. We sell out mostly every week. We try to keep the prices as low and as reasonable as we can, with plenty of food. I was brought up in the valleys, so I\u0027m used to nice, big plates.  Chris describes his service as a production line and from prepping the veg to pouring the gravy and cooking the meat, everyone on his team has their own inidual jobs. My team is awesome - we\u0027re like a well-oiled machine and they\u0027ve been with me for a long time, Chris said. Everyone has got their own inidual job. Someone is on the phone, someone is on the till, the girls put the veg on the plates and I cook the meat. After leaving school, Chris worked in a fish shop for two years before training to become a chef at his local pub. He spent more than 12 years cooking at the pub, and it was this experience that sparked the idea for his future business. We\u0027d do Sunday dinners at the pub every week and a lot of people would pop in and ask  they could take the dinners away, Chris said. Only around 10-15 people would come in and eat, but loads of people would take dinners away. I could see how popular it was, so when a shop became available I decided to go on my own. Around 14 years ago, Chris took the plunge and opened up his own business in the form of Curlys Dinners. Originally opening as a caf\u0026eacute/diner, the venue had a seating area and a salad/breakfast bar, as well as the takeaway roast dinner service on a Sunday.  We were open for around four years and then I had kids and it all got too busy, Chris said. We closed and I ended up working in a factory for a while. But it wasn\u0027t long before Curlys re-opened. When we first re-opened, we were still serving food throughout the week, he said. But after the local bank closed the amount of visitors we had to the caf\u0026eacute dropped. So, we decided to keep it to a Sunday, make it a takeaway service and pour all of our resources into that. We took on more delivery drivers, worked longer hours and it took off from there. Curlys now produces hundreds of roast dinners every month, and the company has established itself as a real player on the Valleys food scene, with queues out the door most weeks. But, there\u0027s one month in particular that gets really busy. Christmas is always really busy, Chris said. We\u0027re usually fully booked by December 1, and we get orders in as early as September. We\u0027ve had a hundred orders this year aleady. Christmas dinners at Curlys sell out every year, and costing just \u0026pound12 for dinner and dessert it\u0027s not hard to see why. Each festive dinner - which is prepared and picked up on Christmas eve - comes with a choice of meat, potatoes , vegetables, Yorkshire pudding, stuffing, gravy and, of course, pigs in blankets. There\u0027s also a vegetarian option and a choice of desserts, including Christmas pudding with brandy sauce. Because our building is so small, we can only do a certain amount of Christmas dinners - but they sell out every year, Chris said. The winter can be quite dficult, especially when it snows.

Tanya Cox, 38, from Hull, has been working in the industry since she was 27 but says she often thinks about getting a real job. She was scouted as a glamour model while working as a lap dancer and says her past experience enabled her to be comfortable in front of the camera. Despite loving her job, Tanya says she thought about giving up her career when jobs dried up after she turned 30. However, she\u0027s now finding success again as she breaks into the \u0027mature market\u0027. How did you get into modelling and was it something you always wanted to do? I never really thought about doing any modelling work but whilst I was working as a lap dancer, I got approached by an agency and was asked  I would consider doing any modelling work.     I was quite shocked as I thought you had to be tall and skinny to do any kind of modelling but they reassured me that was just the fashion industry and that I was perfect for glamour. How old were you and how long have you been doing it? I came into the industry at 27 and I’m now 38. What was it like at first and what kind of things you were doing? Having already worked as a lap dancer for three years, I was very comfortable with modelling straight away. I think its the taking your clothes off bit that worries most new glamour models but as I had already been doing that for three years, that was the easy part, it was learning to find the light and what angles suited me that took the time the learn. Was you aware of any challenges the industry faced at the beginning? No, when I first came into the industry, everything seemed great, people were much more reliable with higher standards always putting quality first back then. But now its more quantity over quality and trying to get as much as possible shot in the time frame are booked for. Was there ever a point where you regretted getting into modelling? When I first turned 30, my work really quietened off as some companies considered me too old for the young market but I still looked too young to break the mature market. It was a very low point in my le and feeling my career slip away made me so depressed at times that I wished I never started. What has been the best things about it? Are there any moments which stand out where you loved it? I think for me, it helped me to find my own inner strength. I was guilty of never sticking up for myself when I was younger but now I\u0027m the first to say when anyone is out of order, whether it\u0027s towards myself, a friend or even a stranger. Also through modelling and dancing, I have now met the best friends that I have ever had. I trust them completely and never doubt anymore that they all love me, as much as I love them. What has been some of the worst things about it? The worst thing about modelling is the high cancellation rates which has been getting worse and worse each year since 2010, but I don\u0027t think that is just an industry problem, I think society in general has forgotten its manners because I have noticed that more and more people cancel social meets with friends than ever before too.  Have you ever been judged based on your career? What do you think of that? Not in my personal le, but since my work started to quieten off and I have been trying to get a \u0027normal job\u0027, I do feel like employers are discriminating against me as I don\u0027t even seem to be able to get an interview these days, and when I was younger I always found it so easy to get work. When a place I worked at closed down, I had a new job within a week. How successful have you been? I felt pretty successful when I was younger but I do think I would of had a better career had I started when I was younger as it only lasted a few years before my peak ran out. I am now just starting to finally break the mature market, so fingers crossed I can make a success of that, but early days yet. Modelling must have changed since you started - have you seen that and in what way? It certainly has, all the technology keeps changing, I don\u0027t know how the photographers keep up. And unfortunately the budgets aren\u0027t as big anymore. I really miss the days of make-up artists and clothing departments on all shoots, but these days its only the very biggest companies that provide those now and for most shoots we just get a list of what types clothing to bring with us and have to do our own hair and make-up. Do you think it will change in the future and in what way? We are seeing dferent types of models coming through now We are and I love that we are now celebrating ersity with models now coming in dferent shapes, sizes, styles and ages. I met a new model on set recently who had just started doing topless modelling at 52. Social media has also come to the forefront and many models experience trolling - is that something you\u0027ve experienced? Yes, I have had a few negative comments but, for every bad comment I get, there is always at least 20 positive comments to counter-act it and the troll then usually ends up getting loads of grief for his/her comment anyway so it always back fires on them.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are also about to embark on a royal tour, visiting Australia and New Zealand later this month for their first overseas tour as husband and we.  The couple, who were married in May, were invited to visit these countries by their respective local governments, with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office requesting that they also visit Fiji and Tonga.  The 16-day visit will coincide with the 2018 Invictus Games, which kick off in Sydney on October 20. But who exactly is footing the bill for this rather exciting trip?  Kensington Palace told  that the costs of royal tours are typically covered by the host government, and that is true for this trip.  A spokesman said: In common with all Realm visits, the costs of the visit will be met by the host governments.   They added that any costs related to the Invictus Games part of the programme will be covered by the Invictus Games Foundation, which Prince Harry is patron of.  During the tour, all eyes will be on the Duchess of Sussex as she gets to grips with becoming one half of a royal tour double act.  The couple will be following in the footsteps of Harry\u0027s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, whose first official tour upon entering into married le was also to Australia and New Zealand.  During that trip, Charles and Diana travelled 23,601 miles and spent a total of 41 days overseas.   The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also visited the same places, being away for 18 days and covering 23,701 miles.  Meghan has revealed she\u0027s really looking forward to the upcoming tour. Speaking as part of ITV\u0027s new royal documentary Queen of the World, Meghan said she\u0027s feeling very excited and hinted that the pair plan on doing more travelling in the near future.

Researchers who carried out a detailed study found keeping the \u0027castle\u0027 in tip top condition demands 104 hours of decorating or DIY, 493 hours cleaning and \u0026pound1,081 on tradesmen coming round every year. It also emerged more than one third feel incredibly proud of their homes, with half admitting they regularly spending hours ensuring it is beautully presented. Furthermore across the average home’s lespan, owners will fork out an incredible \u0026pound505 a year on updating d\u0026eacutecor including furniture, soft furnishings and kitchenware.  In addition, \u0026pound203 will be spent each year on DIY, while a further \u0026pound144 a year goes on buying cleaning products. But despite the obvious pride, one in 10 owners have not invested in any sort of home security system, and 41 per cent only consider it when they’re away from the house. A spokesman for Yale, which carried out the study among 2,000 homeowners in conjunction with National Home Security Month, said: “It seems bizarre that homeowners are so focussed on creating a home which they want to show off to family and friends, and yet many have done little to protect that investment. “Two thirds of respondents haven’t installed any kind of house alarm or home security system. “And just 17 per cent have put a security camera up on their wall to keep an eye on who’s coming and going from their immaculate homes.” Outside the house, the average Brit will spend over 11 hours a month gardening, adding up to 132 hours over a year – the equivalent of five and a half full days. When we’re not working on our homes, we’re worrying about them – Brits will spend more than four hours each week fretting about how their castle needs a clean or some DIY doing.  And then there’s a further seven hours spend weekly devising exactly how best to make the changes – by updating with a lick of paint or moving a piece of furniture. More than six in 10 homeowners agree that An Englishman’s home is his castle. And a huge 86 per cent believe their home is their best investment, therefore it is wise to look after it. However, the OnePoll study also found a lack of security found in many British homes suggests this is far from the truth. And a fth of Brits admit they don’t feel their home is quite as secure as it could be when they aren’t there. And while 45 per cent of adults will ask a neighbour to check on their property while they’re away from the home for a long holiday, just 15 per cent are currently a member of the local neighbourhood watch scheme.

The landlord of the Grimsby property said the tenants left owing \u0026pound1,700 in rent as well as weeks worth of rent to clean and restore the flat.  After going to inspect the house when they left, he said he was disgusted at the state it had been left in, with cupboard doors ripped off, waste scattered over the floor and thick grime left on surfaces, reports Grimsby Live .  The landlord, known only as Gary, said they ruined the kitchen, which was completely covered in dirt and grime, with bags of rubbish and waste left scattered all over it. Many of the cupboard doors were broken off of their hinges. They also found that doors throughout the house had been broken, the carpets had been damaged beyond repair, electrical sockets had been knocked out of the walls and were left hanging loose and the bathroom had also been left in a state of disrepair.  The problems were not just found in the house however - there was a huge pile of rubbish bags in the back garden. He claimed they had also left the property owing more than \u0026pound1,700 in rent after experiencing problems with their benefits. His property manager Anne, said it has completely put them off renting to tenants who are on housing benefits, saying that they have had numerous problems with people on Universal Credit going into arrears. Despite the shocking state of the house, the landlord managed to completely refurbish the property in just a week, after Nottingham Council contacted them about housing a family in need.  Anne said: After we found the house in such an awful condition, we were steadfast against ever renting to people on housing benefits or renting through the local authority. But then Nottingham Council contacted us, explaining that they were in urgent need of some help to house a desperate family. At first we were apprehensive, but the council offered to provide us with three months rent in advance so we could make the necessary repairs. We ended up giving the house a complete make-over, with a new kitchen, carpets, paint, electrics and doors. If this never happened then we would still be struggling to have the house repaired, as the lack of rent and sheer amount of damage would have left us out severely out of pocket. This is not the only property that this landlord has had issues with in Grimsby, as another was ruined by squatters, after another tenant, who was on Universal Credit, was evicted after owing thousands in rent.  The squatters had started a fire in the kitchen of the property, took drugs and even kicked through the wall into a neighbour\u0027s house. Anne continued: Since the introduction of Universal Credit we have had constant problems with tenants falling into rental arrears, the whole system just doesn\u0027t seem fit for purpose. Many times when a tenant goes onto the benefit system, there is no communication with us as landlords, and for the first few months we often get no rent paid. To try and fix this we have sent documents to tenants and the Department of Work and Pensions, providing them with the correct forms so that rent is paid directly to us, but we have just hit brick wall after brick wall while doing this.

In a special documentary to be broadcast this evening, Michael Patrick Reilly and James Francis Gavin are identied as allegedly being involved in the attacks. Reilly has never before been publicly named as a suspect, while Gavin has been connected, but not as one of those suspected of planting devices. Reilly has denied any involvement. Evidence uncovered in the new probe implicates both as allegedly having key roles in the 1974 atrocity, when two bombs exploded in crowded pubs in the city centre. The blasts at the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern In the Town were among the deadliest of the Troubles.  Six men – known as the Birmingham Six – had their convictions quashed in 1991 after 16 years in prison.  They had always insisted they were beaten and signed false confessions. No one has since been brought to justice.  In tonight’s ITV Exposure programme, court documents reveal Reilly – a member of the Birmingham IRA cell – was questioned about the pub attacks in the 1970s. But it never emerged as Reilly was charged in connection with six unrelated bombings and conspiracy. He pleaded guilty to four of the seven charges and got ten years. The ITV team looked at material in the National Archives and interviewed officers from the original inquiry. Bill Squires, a former detective inspector for West Midlands Police anti-terror squad, originally arrested Reilly in 1975 as a suspected IRA member. “I thought he’d done something serious,” Squires told the programme. “And that he was happy to make admissions and accept a sentence because there was more serious matters in the locker.”  Confronted recently in Belfast by ITV’s John Ware, Reilly denied planting the bombs, or knowing the bombings were going to take place. He did not comment on being a member of the IRA or the allegation he was the unnamed man who previously admitted involvement to ITV’s World in Action. “I’ve got nothing to say,” he said. “Well, you can ask what you want, but I’m not going to answer. You’re wasting your time.” James Gavin died in 2002. In 1977, he murdered a suspected IRA informant and was sentenced to le. It comes as the Court of Appeal has ruled a new inquest into the attacks will not consider the identity of the bombers. But relatives are still desperate for answers.

Overnight, the lowest temperature recorded was -1.7C in Eskdalemuir, Scotland, while it was -1.7C at Kielder Castle, Northumberland.  A few places dipped to under 0C, the Met Office said, but conditions should improve amid sunshine today and over the course of the week.  And despite a chilly start to the week, by Wednesday and Thursday temperatures will even be slightly above average.  High pressure will be in charge for much of the rest of the week bringing balmy weather for large swathes of Britain, while staying cloudy most of the time, the Weather Channel says. The best of the warmth will be in the south-east where the mercury could reach 21C by midweek. There is a risk of some sharp showers in the north-west where low pressure and associated cold fronts brush the fringes of Scotland, forecasters say.  But generally for the rest of the UK, there will be some mild days with brightest weather in the north and spells of drizzle possible further south. Winds will be stronger in northern areas of Scotland with a chance of gale force gusts, but it should stay calmer in southern regions and the Midlands. A spokesperson for The Weather Channel said: “It will be mostly dry with a mixture of cloud and bright, or sunny, spells under higher pressure extending eastwards from the Atlantic. “Temperatures will be around normal and above normal in the south and nearing 20C although there could be some rain for the North Sea coasts.” "},{"url":null,"title":"as it happens dundee united v ross county","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCries of \u0026#8216Csaba out\u0026#8217 rang around Tannadice as United slumped to an embarrassing defeatShambolic, abject, and abysmal are all words that can be used to describe Dundee United\u0026#8217s performance as they were humiliated on their own patch by Ross County.The Terrors were hopeless at the back and pretty blunt going forward as the Staggies romped to all three points. It is hard to defend United manager Csaba Laszlo now and it would be no surprise  he is given his jotters after this most horric of days.It started when eventual hat-trick hero and former Tangerine Billy Mckay opened the scoring from close range on 11 minutes, knocking in a Josh Mullin cross.The only chink of light in the game came six minutes later as Pavol Safranko got on the end of Fraser Aird\u0026#8217s delivery to guide the ball past Scott Fox in the away net.From there United laboured and County took advantage. Scoring the most simple and avoidable goals \u0026#8211 often carbon copies of each other.The second came on 29 minutes after a Jamie Robson mistake played in Mullin to square for Mckay to knock in.On 41 minutes the same problems United had faced all game down their left-hand side were there for all to see as Sean Kelly inswinging free-kick went all the way through past Matej Rakovan in the home net. A horrible goal to concede with no communication evident and the defence at sixes and sevens.Soon after the restart the Staggies put the game to bed when Mullin and Mckay linked up again with the former this time tapping in from a yard out on 50 minutes.Mullin turned provider, once more, two minutes later laying Mckay\u0026#8217s hat-trick on a plate for him and the Northern Irishman gobbled it up from a matter of inches out.Csaba tried to change things for the Tangerines, but by this point the punters had seen enough and were leaving in their droves and calling for his head in the process, as he brought on Stewart Murdoch and Fraser Fyvie to try to change things on 56 minutes.And three minutes later Murdoch summed up the Terrors afternoon as he was shown a straight red for a stamp on Jamie Lindsay.It capped what was United\u0026#8217s worst performance in years as County saw out the rest of the game with little problem.

It read:Sandy Davie is back at Tannadice Park.Last night, team manager Jim McLean completed a transfer deal for the big goalkeeper, an ex-Scotland U/23 cap.It’s three-and-a-half years since Davie  left United for Luton Town for a transfer fee of £8,000.He then joined Southampton two years later.The circle was completed yesterday when Sandy ed for his second spell with United.There was no fee involved.After the transfer, Davie, now 27, said: “I can hardly believe this.“The move came right out of the blue.“I’ve been hoping to get away from Southampton for some time, simply because of the consistency of Eric Martin  gave me little chance of a first-team place.“In my term there, I played just four games for the league side.“But the transfer deadline came and passed, and so did the end of the season.“I thought my chances of an early transfer were slender.“Even at that, I never dreamed that Dundee United would come for me again.”Sandy is married with two young sons.He’ll sell his Southampton house and move north as soon as possible.He’ll be a very valuable member of the Tannadice pool. A point stressed by Jim McLean.Said the boss: “With Donald Mackay away, I need another experienced goalkeeper to join Hamish McAlpine. “Sandy Davie fits the bill.”When Davie left Tannadice, McAlpine was the No 3 keeper, just beginning to challenge Davie and Mackay.McLean also announced that Davie will go on tour with United to Nigeria next week — provided all formalities can be completed in time.Soon after signing, Davie was on the receiving end of ‘jags’ for the trip.It means that 17 Tannadice players will now be making the tour, and it’s an ideal opportunity for Davie to get into the swing of things.On leaving Tannadice for a second time a year later, he emigrated to New Zealand, and played for North Shore United, Mount Wellington and Napier City Rovers.Davie was also capped for New Zealand on 11 occasions.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5bae2d6329cb5-e1538141957941.jpg ","title":"blether this is when east fife previously scored six goals away from home","story":"\t\t\t\t\tEach week, BwB gives a sample from the Readers’ Queries file in the old Sporting Post.SP Query – On April 20, 1991, ‘Edinburgh East Fe Fan’ asked: Prior to the recent 6-3 win over Alloa, when was the last time East Fe scored six goals away?SP answer – You’ve had to wait over 27 years.

woeful start to the Premiership season, losing their opening six fixtures and scoring just twice.At the start of that run was also a 3-0 home defeat in the Betfred Cup to Ayr United, making it seven defeats on the trot.In none of those matches have Dundee managed to put themselves in front and their gaffer is desperate for the players to at least give themselves a chance of picking up a result.In order to do that, they’ll have to get the better of an Accies side high on confidence after a 3-0 thumping of St Mirren in match that has had a bit of extra spice over the past few years.And despite extra pressure on him to get the result, Neil still has faith in his side.He said: “It’s a huge game, they always have been against Hamilton.“The games against Livingston, Hamilton, Kilmarnock are going to be so important and then Hibs and Hearts.“We are still striving for that first win and we’ll keep trying to give everything to get ourselves that first goal that can at least put ourselves in a position to go and get that first win.“I still think that you could see in the first 45 minutes last Saturday, there is a team there.“I would just love to see them give themselves an easier ride by putting themselves in front.”The Dens gaffer is also hopeful of having some extra bodies back fit after a punishing injury-hit spell.Josh Meekings, Genseric Kusunga, Nathan Ralph and Sofien Moussa all missed the defeat to Hibs with injury while Kenny Miller was suspended.He’ll also miss Saturday’s trip to Hamilton while Kharl Madianga, Calvin Miller and Benjamin Kallman all added to the injury worries last weekend.The good news is winger Roarie Deacon is nearing a  after getting 45 minutes under his belt in a bounce game this week.Neil added: “We’ve not had an easy run of it and it’s been tough to get a settled side out.“We had Glen Kamara and Ryan Inniss back from injury lay-offs on Saturday but it’s been problematic in terms of that.“I have been happy with the squad,  I can get them all fit it would be welcome but we’ve not been able to get that.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5bae43e9ee079-846x564.jpg ","title":"something

the city’s new £80 million V\u0026ampA museum.An exclusive online poll by the Evening  has revealed more than 80% of our readers have either already paid a visit to the attraction or plan on doing so soon – about 40% each.Just 18% said they didn’t plan on visiting the V\u0026ampA at all.A total of 444 people responded to our survey featuring a series of questions about people’s early perceptions of the museum of design.Nearly two-thirds of those who took part in the poll said they were happy with the public money that had been used to build and run the attraction.Respondent Stan Riley defended the spending, insisting the benefits “will be reaped many times over” by future generations.Paul McFadyen, from Menzieshill, added: “The money for the project was invested over a decade. I would actually say the museum is good value for money  anything.”Just 7% were “not fussed” about the spend while 32% said they would like to have seen the cash invested elsewhere.Reader Mark Petrie said he felt it would be years before the city knows for certain whether it was worth the money while Alison Donald wrote: “Meantime, what is happening to the people of Dundee using foodbanks?”We asked people to rate the V\u0026ampA from one to 10, based on what they’d seen of the museum so far.A total of 179 people – 40% – gave it full marks, with another 11% giving it nine out of 10 and 10% rating it as eight out of 10.Tele reader Dave Alexander wrote: “I love it, for once we have something to be proud of in our city. Work in progress, I say.”Mike Swan added: “Heck of a lot better than what was there before. Don’t knock it, enjoy it.”Just 49 people, 11% of those who responded, said they’d give it one out of 10, with the other placings spread between 2%-6%.We asked readers to tell us what their favourite part of V\u0026ampA Dundee was. The most popular was the museum’s appearance from the outside, which was top of the list for 170 people – 38% of respondents. 100vw, 620px\" /Nearly 30% said the permanent exhibitions, including Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s iconic Oak Room, was their favourite part.A total of 58 people – 13% – voted for the temporary Ocean Liners exhibition while nine folk said the cafe or restaurant was their favourite. Just 79 people said they didn’t like any part.We also asked readers to identy the biggest benefit to Dundee of having the museum. More than 40% said they felt the indirect jobs the museum would bring to the city, through attracting investment from other companies, was the biggest pluspoint.Lisa Lawrence wrote: “It will give confidence to businesses looking to move to the city.“Growth has to start somewhere so why not with this investment in a great city?”A further 22% said they believed V\u0026ampA Dundee had improved the way the city looked, though just 5% felt the biggest benefit would be educating people in design and the arts.A further 6% felt the jobs created by the museum itself was the biggest thing to celebrate.Just 18% of people said they felt the V\u0026ampA would bring no benefits to Dundee.A sceptical Ian McGhee wrote: “In a couple of years one or two of those new hotels will be closed as there are too many of them, and the V\u0026ampA will be used for local kids as a school trip. There won’t be demand for hotels long-term.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5baca1ebda4b5-416x564.jpg ","title":"we are not manchester city csaba explains why he feels being dundee united boss is the hardest job in scottish football","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThere were some cursory glances around the Press room at the Falkirk Stadium after Dundee United’s 2-0 win on Saturday when boss Csaba Laszlo, almost out of nowhere, asserted the following.“The most dficult job in the Scottish Championship, or Scottish football at the moment, is to be the manager of Dundee United.”He qualied that statement by adding that it is also dficult for his players to pull on the black and tangerine but his remarks did pique the interests of those gathered.It wasn’t so much disagreement or astonishment that filled the room but more a sense of being taken aback by the brutal honesty of a man who has been under such pressure of late.He eased some of the weight on his shoulders with the result at Falkirk under what were strange circumstances – namely going up against predecessor Ray McKinnon in the opposite dugout for a side sitting bottom and pointless.And it was clear that, despite assertions by some that Csaba is daft or clueless, he was very aware of the ramications had he not got the right result.“We showed good team spirit under pressure, they handled it positively,” Csaba commented as he laid out his case to the gathered press.“Now we can close this chapter and look ahead to the next game which will be very dficult.“This is the third season where the fans have been disappointed to be in the second tier and we are talking about a very massive, strong and passionate club that wants to be in Premiership.“If something doesn’t go right immediately you have noise which is OK but we don’t want to hide behind anything.“We have this pressure and we have to accept.“We don’t want to spend one more year in the Championship – it’s not good.“The Dundee United fans don’t want to hear that from the board, the manager or anybody. They want to have the target of promotion and winning the league.“This is pressure, this is normal but you have to understand we have a budget that isn’t any higher than other teams in the main.“You have to bring a team together. We had 19 players leave and 16 players come in for the new season.“We can’t click our fingers and have the team work fantastically.“There are rules at the club about how many or which kind of players we can bring in within our budget.“It is not easy, we are not Manchester City with an owner behind you who can give you £20 million to go and spend.“We have to work with the budget we have to get the best for the club.“The Dundee United board have done a fantastic job. It is not easy to convince players from abroad to come to the Scottish Championship with everything else around.”It was quite a defence – but probably one that was coming after weeks of trying to keep a lid on it following poor results against Alloa and Morton.Yes, he has not had his troubles to seek with injury and scrutiny from all angles but it seems to be just the beginning for Csaba in his most tough of jobs.In the next four weeks they take on title rivals Ross County, Ayr United, Partick Thistle and Inverness. They kick off that run at home to County on Saturday.“I don’t just look at one game being more important than the other because you can’t afford to take any game lightly,” Csaba added. “You have to take every opponent seriously, whether they be at the top, middle or bottom of the league.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"                          POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"                          AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged \u0026pound490 million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-woman-who-brings-the-biggest-stars-to-glasgow","story":"                          OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the world\u0027s biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"take-that-fans-left-disappointed-after-glasgow-ticket-fiasco","story":"                          Take That fans have been left disappointed after failing to get their hands on tickets for their greatest hits show."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed-festive-old-firm-derby-date-confirmed","story":"                          THE final Rangers and Celtic clash of the year has been announced."},{"url":null,"title":"brendan-rodgers-tells-celtic-striker-leigh-griffiths-to-show-humility-with-his-celebrations","story":"                          Even as the goals start to come for Leigh Grfiths, there has still been a little rebuke from his manager."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-some-of-the-acts-coming-to-the-venue-over-the-next-year","story":"                          THE Eagles have announced they will  to the Hydro for their 2019 world tour."},{"url":null,"title":"jim-brogan-tears-as-friends-and-family-gather-in-glasgow-to-say-goodbye-to-celtic-legend","story":"                          THE funeral of Celtic legend Jim Brogan has taken place in Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"kilmarnock-3-motherwell-1-comeback-kings-strike-again-as-curtis-main-lets-kilmarnock-off-the-hook","story":"                          COMEBACK kings Kilmarnock roared back from behind for the second week in a row as Greg Stewart\u0027 virtuoso display helped them turn over Motherwell at Rugby Park."},{"url":null,"title":"major-search-for-young-coatbridge-woman-who-vanished-from-her-family-home-distressed","story":"                          A MAJOR search has been launched for a young Coatbridge woman who has been dealing with personal issues."},{"url":null,"title":"young-man-24-whose-disappearance-is-out-of-character-could-be-in-glasgow","story":"                          POLICE searching for a young man whose disappearance a week ago has been described as \u0027out of character\u0027 believe he could be in Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"major-retailer-signals-interest-in-new-retail-park-at-former-barrhead-nestle-site","story":"                          Developers of a former pet food factory in Barrhead have announced the first company who will set up shop as part of a \"state-of-the-art\" retail park."},{"url":null,"title":"this-morning-to-celebrate-30-years-with-birthday-party-live-in-glasgows-george-square","story":"                          DAYTIME favourite This Morning will celebrate 30 years on air with a birthday party in Glasgow\u0027s George Square."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-author-helen-fitzgerald-behind-new-bbc-drama-the-cry-explores-every-parents-worst-nightmare","story":"                          FORGET Bodyguard.

Recent figures showed the fund increased in value in 2016-17 by \u0026pound31.1 million. As of last weekend, it was valued at \u0026pound2,013,164,722.61.Addressing colleagues on the audit and scrutiny committee, Cllr MacLean called for a review of investment strategy. She acknowledged the need to secure the best .But she added: \u0026ldquoSome people are not happy with some of the investments and feel that perhaps  it\u0027 invested in tobacco or arms or things like that, it\u0027 not ethically responsible.She asked whether fund trustees had any say in the choice of investments.The council\u0027 investments change on a daily basis.Recent examples of contentious choices include British American Tobacco , liqueurs firm Pernod Ricard , pubs chain Mitchells and Butlers , Japan Tobacco  and China\u0027 second largest brewery, Tsingtao .The council\u0027 finance director Derek Yule explained that an investments sub-committee reports to a pension board which sets the strategy.\u0026ldquoIt is very dficult when some of the investment strategy seeks to invest in shares in companies not just in the UK but worldwide, he said.\u0026ldquoWhilst I totally understand some of the ethical debate, it is very dficult to draw a line sometimes.\u0026ldquoYou might take a view\u0026hellip would you invest in banks, for example? They might not be the best investment, anyway. But I use that as an example because banks will fund these companies.\u0026ldquoIt\u0027 a dficult balancing act but it\u0027 certainly within your rights  you wished the pension board to look at the investment strategy.\u0026ldquoFund managers are given guidelines to work to, so that would be quite legitimate for the council to do through the pension board.According to current policy, the fund \u0026ldquorecognises that social, environmental and ethical considerations are among factors investment managers will take into account, where relevant, when selecting investments for purchase, retention or sale.However, it stresses that \u0026ldquothe overriding consideration for pension committee members is their fiduciary duty to the scheme employers and scheme members.The Scheme Advisory Board, established up by the Scottish Government to regulate such public sector pension funds, recently obtained advice from legal counsel on the duty of pensions committees.The guidance concluded that: \u0026ldquoPensions committees in Scotland owe a fiduciary duty to the scheme employers and the scheme members in general and specically in relation to investment matters.\u0026ldquoThose duties should be exercised in the best interests of the beneficiaries and in relation to investment decisions, should aim to achieve the best financial position for the fund, balancing risk and  in the usual way.Monday 1 Oct 2018 10:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117654.jpg","title":"Response to Charlie tale stuns cat owner","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMarie MacIver, who lives in Hilton and relies on disability benefit, lives alone with her five-year-old cat Charlie.She got in touch with the Courier after it became apparent that Charlie\u0027 injured leg needed an X-ray, which she could not afford.She had already contacted animal welfare charities without success.After we printed the story last week, we were inundated with offers of help for little Charlie \u0026ndash and Mrs MacIver admitted she was moved to tears.\u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot know what I would have done without everyone who offered to help, she said.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove been in tears because people have been so nice.

over the defending Premiership champions having triumphed 1-0 at Parkhead in the final game of last season.The pressure was on Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers following the defending champions worst start to a league campaign in 20 years.However the Hoops grabbed the three points courtesy of an improvised back-heeled goal from substitute Scott Sinclair in the second half.Aberdeen made two changes to the side which edged past Hibs 6-5 on penalties in a draining League Cup quarter-final clash at Easter Road on Tuesday evening.Striker Stevie May ed to the starting line up with Sam Cosgrove dropping to the bench.Northern International winger Niall McGinn also ed ahead of loan Derby County left-back Max Lowe.Celtic created the first opportunity in the second minute following a swt passing move that culminated in a  Mikael Lustig cut back to James Forrest but the Scotland cap\u0026#8217ss curling 15 yard shot flashed wide.The Dons threatened on the quarter hour mark when a corner kick swung in from the left was cleared as far as Gary Mackay-Steven at the edge of the box but the winger sliced his shot well wide.It was a cautious start from both sides who were showing mutual respect.Mackay-Steven was becoming increasingly influential on the left flank and burst down the wing in the 19th minute before crossing towards the far edge of the penalty area.McGinn raced in to meet Mackay-Steven\u0026#8217s delivery but  drilled a powerful 20 yard drive just wide.Moments later McGinn crossed into the box and it just agonisingly alluded the unmarked James Wilson eight yards in front of goal.Celtic were denied by the woodwork in the 25th minute when a curling effort from Odsonne Edouard from 25 yards beat ing keeper Joe Lewis only to crack off the far post.Aberdeen came close with a superb attack when Mackay-Steven drove at goal and stepped past two challenges inside the penalty box to open up a shooting opportunity.Keeper Craig Gordon somehow pushed it behind.From the resultant corner Andy Considine, who netted in the 1-0 win in May, rose to power in a header that beat Gordon but Leigh Grfiths was on the line to kick clear.In the 48th minute Dons keeper Lewis pushed a low drive from Callum McGregor wide for a corner.On loan Manchester United striker James Wilson fired in a superb 25 yard curling effort from the right only to be denied by Gordon\u0026#8217s ing save in the 52nd minute.Wilson was to come off on the hour mark to be replaced by Sam Cosgrove.Celtic went ahead in the 63rd minute when a ball from James Forrest into the box took a deflection that sent it spinning up into the box.Substitute Scott SINCLAIR used real improvisation and awareness to back-heel the ball into the net from six yards.It came at a time when Celtic were becoming increasingly frustrated and Aberdeen influential.In the 73rd minute Grfiths\u0026#8217 shot a free-kick wide of the defensive wall but keeper Lewis got down to block.The Dons should have equalized in the 75th minute when Mackay-Steven whipped in an intelligent free-kick towards the onrushing Mikey Devlin but with the goal beckoning the defender volleyed it wide.Deep into injury time Grfiths broke upfield and clearly pulled on the jersey of Devlin to gain an advantage. The referee waved play on and Grfiths raced upfield only to miss when chipping over the advancing Lewis.Aberdeen: Lewis, Logan, Shinnie, Considine, McKenna, Wilson, McGinn, Mackay-Steven, May, Devlin, Ball.Subs: Cosgrove , Lowe , Anderson Subs not used: Cerny, Forrester, Gleeson, Campbell.Celtic: Gordon, Hendry, Brown, Grfiths, Boyata, Ntcham, Edouard, Lustig, McGregor, Forrest, Tierney.Subs: Sinclair , Rogic , Morgan .Subs not used: Bain,  Gamboa,  Christie,  Mulumbu.Referee: Bobby Madden\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sign our petition to change time of aberdeen semi final clash at hampden3","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDons fans have branded the decision to make Aberdeen’s League Cup semi-final against Rangers at Hampden a noon kick-off “an absolute disgrace”.Supporters’ groups, the club and Hearts have all hit out after it was revealed both semi-finals would be played at the national stadium in Glasgow on the same day.And now the Evening Express has launched a petition in an effort to make the SPFL reconsider the ridiculous scheduling of the Aberdeen v Rangers League Cup semi-final on Sunday October 28.The lunchtime kick-off is an outrageous time for fans from the north-east to get to Hampden – and scheduling the Hearts v Celtic semi on the same day at the same venue only compounds the problem.Sign this petition to send a message to the SPFL that’s loud and clear: This showpiece fixture MUST be changed to a new venue or time for the sake of the fans.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"wolves interested in dons defender mckenna reports","story":"\t\t\t\t\tEnglish Premier League side Wolverhampton Wanderers are reportedly interested in Aberdeen\u0026#8217s Scott McKenna.The Scotland international has played in the Dons\u0026#8217 last three matches after recovering from a hamstring injury suffered against Rangers on August 5.Scouts from the Molineux club are believed to have taken in the Reds\u0026#8217 1-0 win over Motherwell on Saturday week.If the Midlands outfit wish to sign McKenna, 21, in the January transfer window they will have to play top dollar as he is under contract until the summer of 2023.During the summer transfer window Aberdeen threw out bids from Celtic and Aston Villa for the stopper.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/09/5badc58be21fb-e1538151424553-710x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen girl abis boxing clever for achievements in sport","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAbi Allan has already shown success in her sport – despite being only 12 years old.The S2 Bridge of Don Academy pupil competes in kickboxing, and has been extremely successful.She is shortlisted for the physical achievement award, which is part of the Children and Young People’s Services Awards which aim to recognise the achievements of young people through sport.She was nominated by head teacher at Bridge of Don Academy Daphne McWilliam.Abi was selected to be part of the Team GB squad in the +47kg category, and placed third in the World Championships which were held in Budapest in May – facing stf competition from some of the top competitors in the world.She is the current British and Scottish WAKO champion in her weight category, and was crowned Open Weight champion in January 2018.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live le as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres.

This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC.

On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn\u0026#8217t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry\u0026#8217s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say 10,000. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don\u0026#8217t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormous  of coastline. Scotland\u0026#8217s coast is about 18,500 kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate \u0026#8211 an enormously expensive system both in money and CO2 emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant \u0026#8211 it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September 21 is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are 90,000 people with dementia in Scotland and 1,982 people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past 24 years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities. Alzheimer Scotland wants to make sure that people with dementia and their carers can work with local decision makers, helping to influence important decisions about how vital care and support is delivered in their area.We need your help to ensure people with dementia and carers get the best possible standard of care and support, anywhere in Scotland.

She explained her fascination with how each portrayed the concept in very dferent ways, from the peaceful portrayal of moonlit nature to expressions of personal  emotion, struggle and grief.The first work Anna played was Scriabin’s second Sonata, Sonata Fantasie. The ‘moonlit’ first movement was exquisite and the execution of the theme and pianissimo accompaniment at the end was stunning: the helter skelter finale was brilliant.Chopin’s Fantasie in F min, which followed, took us into the realms of personal struggle and, with Anna’s innate musicianship, she made cohesive sense of what can appear a somewhat fragmented work.To end the first part of the recital we heard a flawless rendition of Beethoven’s much-loved Moonlight Sonata, and despite the high octane speed of the finale one could hear every single note.After the interval came Mozart’s D min Fantasia. This deceptively easy-looking short piece, executed perfectly by Anna, demonstrated how dficult it is to play his music where every note and phrase requires minute attention.To conclude her recital, Anna chose Schumann’s great Fantasie in C. This work, while dedicated to Franz Liszt is, in the first movement at least, more an outpouring of his frustration at being denied the hand of his beloved Clara with all its sudden changes in mood. The very technically demanding second movement – a march – is more of a dedication to Liszt and was a thrilling listen. The final slow transcendental movement, which could well have been inspired by the opening movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, took us into a world of ethereal tranquility.After much applause Anna gave us Rachmaninov’s Prelude in G# min. Op.32 No.12 as a fitting encore.After this ‘fantasy’ journey one could only join with those who have been so impressed by the depth and power of Anna’s musicianship. Her ability to squeeze the last drop of emotion from every phrase was very special and a privilege to experience. Finally, to walk out into the clear night air and see the moonlight reflected off the sea like shards of silver seemed an apt end to an evening of fantasy.PIC:Pianist prodigy, Anna Feorova.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer?Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse/harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills 2,000 years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead \u0026#8211 now wasted \u0026#8211 would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year\u0026#8217s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall \u0026#8211 this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £700 at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers \u0026#8211 Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £915.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior/1st male \u0026#8211 Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: 1:10:40Female Senior/1st female –Lucy Fraser 1:15:05Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club 1:17:55Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club 1:10.19.42Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – 1:12:48Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club 1:23:34Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – 1:19:30Female Vintage  – Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club 1:38:22Male Super Vintage  – Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club 1:25:001st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend 1:19:441st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin 1:16:28The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of 1 hour 12 minutes and 56 seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage category  put in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage 70+ age group and won by over 20 minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the 12-mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage race  Alan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at 8 minutes and 9 seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the 40+ veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by 20 seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of 25 minutes 33 seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a 31 minute 7 second run being 10 seconds quicker then Phil Dye and 30 seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteran  female category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veteran  category saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of 1:16:28, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at 1:20:51 and Iain MacNicol in third place 1:23:56. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at 1:19:44, in second place was Sarah Grfin at 1:21:33 and Louise Gibson at 1:25:34 in third place.\u0026nbspTeam EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were 13 teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of 7 minutes 52 seconds, followed only 20 seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only 20 seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction 4.0, ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘40 Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.\u0026nbspThanks, and Feedback\u0026nbspMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

And it was all about being positive while living with autism.He makes a living touring the world talking about and spreading understanding of autism, but opened in Arrochar by making it clear that he does not claim to represent every autistic person.His attitude is: \u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m going to be autistic until my dying breath, so I\u0026#8217m going to be positive.\u0026#8217Dean went on: \u0026#8216We need to identy the challenges and put support in place, but that doesn\u0026#8217t mean we can\u0026#8217t celebrate the dferences \u0026#8211 the skills, the talents and personalities of our fabulous autistic people.\u0026#8217This year is the 20th anniversary of Dean\u0026#8217s diagnosis of autism and at the beginning, by his own admission, he did not take it well.\u0026#8216I thought friendships, a career, relationships were all out of reach for me because I was on the autistic spectrum.\u0026#8217There followed a gradual acceptance of his condition \u0026#8211 helped, he joked, by online dating  and a realisation that autism is something to be celebrated.Anxiety, though, is an ever-present for Dean. \u0026#8216Research tells us that anxiety is much more of an issue for autistics than the general population,\u0026#8217 he said.Offering some personal tips, he suggested \u0026#8216saying less, but with maximum meaning\u0026#8217 to an autistic person experiencing anxiety. And to stay calm.There are bonuses to being autistic, as Dean outlined. \u0026#8216Nobody experiences joy like an autistic. Most people will never get to that level of happiness and wellbeing.\u0026#8217He ended with a tale from his past. \u0026#8216At the age of seven, I was told that by the age of 30 I\u0026#8217d be in prison. I was suspended more times than you could count. I was made to feel I would need to work to overcome autism.\u0026#8216In the second half of my le, so far I have done lecturing, spoken all over the world, I\u0026#8217m a singer, I do a lot of things. And I came to realise that this was not despite being autistic \u0026#8211 it was because of it.\u0026#8217He concluded: \u0026#8216Autism is not about a list of deficits or deficiencies \u0026#8211 it\u0026#8217s a list of dferences, and dference is good.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"council lack of help blasted after lifeline phone peril","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/09/18, 5:52 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowStorm Ali may not have brought the devastation predicted in some quarters, but it did bring down some trees and branches around Mid Argyll.And it left one elderly Lochgilphead couple perilously close to having their leline telecare service cut off on the morning of Wednesday September 19.When a small tree fell from neighbouring land into the garden of Noreen Harvey, it was left resting on the phone line into her home \u0026#8211 which itself was supported by her washing line held up by a clothes pole.Afraid the line would break, 80-year-old Mrs Harvey called Argyll and Bute Council for help shortly after 9am the same day.It wasn\u0026#8217t until the next day , when she called the council again, that she says she was told someone had been out to have a look and it was deemed that the tree had been growing in a private garden, so was nothing to do with the council.Mrs Harvey was left angry at the treatment she received.\u0026#8216The phone line is very important for me and my husband, who is 84, and we rely on it,\u0026#8217 she said. \u0026#8216And the tree wasn\u0026#8217t in a private garden, it was growing in housing association land at the back of my house.

This was an oversight because of demands on the service on the day.\u0026#8217Mrs Harvey added: \u0026#8216The council needs to know that people won\u0026#8217t take this kind of poor service lying down.\u0026#8217The tree was cut from the base by ACHA the day after the storm and later removed by Mr and Mrs Harvey\u0026#8217s family.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayr dancing duo reach finals","story":"NewsAyr dancing duo reach finals of Strictly KidsJake Speirs and Olivia Ferguson from Ayr have made it through intense auditions to compete in the dance contest in aid of STV Children’s Appeal.Share\u0026nbspByAbi Smillie16:17, 27 SEP 2018NewsYoungsters Jake and Olivia will take on the Cha-Cha for charity \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pair of dancing stars have knocked out hundreds of movers to earn a slot in the finals of Strictly Kids. Jake Speirs and Olivia Ferguson from Ayr have made it through intense auditions to compete in the dance contest in aid of STV Children’s Appeal. The 10-year-olds ranked in the top 46 out of a whopping 600 youngsters across the country. And the dance duo had never met, let alone danced together, when they were paired up. Now the movers will take on the cha-cha – a dance neither of them have done before. Olivia, who attends Alloway Primary said: “My mum saw it on Facebook and said to me ‘Olivia do you want to go for this, it’ll be a good opportunity,’ so then I applied. “You sent a clip in of you dancing and  they liked it you got invited for an audition.  “Then we got an email saying ‘come to the second audition’ but it wasn’t a second audition, it was to tell us on camera that we had got into the finals. “We went to a master-class day with all the kids who got through to see what style you’re best at. So there was salsa, cha-cha and others – and then they partnered you with someone and told you at the end of the day what style you’d be doing. “So we had no idea about who we’d be dancing with or what style.” Olivia has been dancing since she was a tot, initially Highland but now specialising in lyrical. And P7 St John’s pupil Jake only started dancing two years ago but has now competed across the country in his freestyle dancing. Recalling being told they had got through to the finals, the pair said they couldn’t believe it. Olivia said: “I felt quite overwhelmed because I wasn’t expecting it.”  Jake added: “Everybody went all silent.” Wannabe dance teacher Jake said winning would mean “a lot”. He said: “Mum would be mega proud.” Olivia added: “It would be amazing.” Rehearsals are well underway for the grand final on November 25 when the duo will take to the floor at the Crowne Plaza in Glasgow in front of 500 people and a panel of guest judges. And the youngsters only have 15 seconds left to learn of their 90-second dance. The cha-cha couple will also be fundraising to raise more monies for the charity. Good luck Jake and Olivia – and keep dancing!

When a local authority starts “mandatory training” of its own councillors in bid to stop embarrassing leaks – you know right away that you’ve got a council with a lot to be embarrassed about! Yes, I know, it’s hard to believe that South Ayrshire Council could actually be embarrassed at all. After some of the strokes this lot have pulled, you couldn’t give them a red face with a blow torch. But it would be interesting to know how many other Scottish councils have called in professional legal tutors to train councillors on their own code of conduct. I don’t know the answer – but I’m guessing it’s another sensational ground-breaking first for go-ahead South Ayrshire! Just like turkeys don’t vote for Christmas, neither do councillors vote for anything that remotely resembles extra work. No, this one has come all the way from the very top where uncomfortable leaks insinuate a lack of total control. Of course, a lack of control can quickly lead to losing control. And “losing control” isn’t a phrase you want to use anywhere near South Ayshire’s chief executive, Eileen Howat.  Earlier this year, Ms Howat  reshuffled the SAC management pack – she discarded a few knaves and dealt herself all the aces.  Now, having sorted out the enemy within, she can focus on the only major threat to her imperious reign – that pesky Ayrshire Post and their constant supply of damaging leaks. The Post, as always, is independent and immovable. All that’s left for Ms Howat is to turn off the leaks at source – not just at any cost – but at all costs. And one of those costs will inevitably be the democratic process and the freedom of the press, or, in her own words: “the issue is information getting out before decisions are made by this council”. Hold on a second, I want to make sure I was reading that properly. “THE ISSUE IS INFORMATION GETTING OUR BEFORE DECISIONS ARE MADE BY THIS COUNCIL.” Call me old fashioned, Ms Howat, but information getting out before a decision is taken is what local government in meant to be all about. In fact, its what any democratic government is about! And  I want to live in a place where information is withheld until a decision is made – I’ll move to North Korea! I know some councillors are still a little unsure of the concept – but they were elected to represent the public. Inform – consult – listen ... and then vote. To help the really thick ones, they put a little reminder on the wall of the council chambers. It says “Ne’e r forget the people”. Perhaps Ms Howat should ask for it to be changed – maybe “Ne’er inform the people” would be more appropriate for the style of local government she has in mind. I don’t know what SAC hope to achieve with all this – but sending councillors to “even walls have ears” class isn’t going to work. The leaks will carry on leaking and the Ayrshire Post will carry on printing them. It was the Duke of Wellington who famously said “Publish and be Damned”. If you look out your window, Ms Howat, you can see the square they named after him.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilNorth KoreaAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"progress made ayr golfing academy","story":"NewsProgress made on Ayr golfing academyThe latest draft design of the facility following consultation shows just two holes being placed at the historic Old Racecourse public park.

The latest draft design of the facility following consultation shows just two holes being placed at the historic Old Racecourse public park. Three holes were originally proposed. So far the council has agreed in principle for it to be located at Belleisle and encroach on the Old Racecourse. The council is considering creating a pitch at Rozelle park to replace the lost playing field at the Old Racecourse. Another pitch would be made available at the new Queen Margaret’s Academy school. The development progress of the golf academy was presented to councillors at the South Ayrshire Council Leadership Panel this week . Depute council leader Brian McGinley, of Labour, said: “This is another step along the journey. “We support this because we realise golf is important for the people of South Ayrshire. We want to encourage young people to take up the sport of golf.” Claire Monaghan, council head of community services and facilities, told the Leadership Panel: “ A lot of working is going on to pull all the strands together.” The politicians agreed the Ayrshire Golf Trust, which is spearheading the venture, could go ahead and apply for funding. She said there is a risk funds may be unavailable  there is a delay in applying. So far the The Ayrshire Golf Trust has consulted with local golf clubs, the public and residents. The latest proposed plans are on display at Belleisle Golf Club.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"hosiery-takes-centre-stage-at-the-va","story":"HAWICK hosiery has secured a prime position in the country\u0026rsquos newest and largest design museums.\nHawick Museum, ran by charitable trust Live Borders, has loaned an outfit to the recently opened Victoria \u0026amp Albert Dundee museum.\nThe Pringle of Scotland ladies ski-pant ensemble, which date from the late 1960s-early 1970s, will be on display for visitors from all over the world at the new V\u0026ampA for the next three years.\nShona Sinclair, Curator Live Borders Museum, Gallery \u0026amp Archive Service, said: \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly honoured that the V\u0026ampA Dundee wanted to display one of our pieces.\n\u0026ldquoIt illustrates the impact and influence that Hawick-made knitwear has had on the design world.\nOriginally displayed in Fully Fashioned: The Pringle of Scotland Story at the National Museum of Scotland in 2015, the ensemble consists of a Cashmere polo neck intarsia sweater, with mauve and cream chevrons, and matching pink ski-pants with stirrup feet straps trimmed with white.\nThe ski-pants were made by Croydor of Switzerland from elasticated fabric for Lilywhites of Piccadilly Circus in London.\nTo extend their sports range it would appear that Pringle collaborated with other manufacturers to produce ensembles such as this one.\nThe outfit is part of the Mulherron Collection which was purchased from Dr Jamie Mulherron in July 2015 with the assistance of National Fund for Acquisitions.\nHawick Museum has a growing collection of garments made in the Borders and representing 100 years of high-quality hosiery and knitwear production, including one of,  not the best, collections of Pringle of Scotland garments, dating from the 1930s to present day.\nMs Lammie added: \u0026ldquoHawick Museum endeavours to work with all textile manufacturers and regularly collaborates with them through exhibits at Borders Textile Towerhouse which sets out to explore the past, present and future of Scottish Borders textile production.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"green-fingered-volunteers-get-gardening-gongs-in-melrose","story":"THE annual Melrose in Bloom awards have been presented.\nHeld at the Ormiston Institute last week, the group\u0026rsquos chairwoman Val Miller handed out a number of top gardening prizes to locals.\nPippa Coles, Abbotsford Gardens and estates development manger, adjudged the Station Hotel to have the \u0026lsquoBest Hotel Floral Display\u0026rsquo and Melrose caravan site to have created the \u0026lsquoBest Other Business Display\u0026rsquo.\nMeanwhile John and Ann Dick picked up the \u0026lsquoBest Private Garden\u0026rsquo accolade.

the roll out won\u0026rsquot be easy to deliver, but that is why this SNP Government has matched its ambition for broadband with \u0026pound600 million of investment \u0026ndash the biggest public investment ever made in a UK broadband project.\n\u0026ldquoI would highlight that the report also praises the Scottish Government for exceeding its target of 95 per cent fibre broadband coverage across Scotland by the end of 2017.\n\u0026ldquoAnd that, due to higher than expected take-up and lower than expected costs, the programme will in fact reach 60,300 more premises than planned \u0026ndash at no extra cost to the public sector.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos absolutely disgraceful that, despite being a reserved matter, the UK Government\u0026rsquos funding contribution to R100 is just three per cent of the total \u0026ndash perhaps Mr Lamont should focus on putting pressure on his colleagues in the Tory UK Government to step up to the plate and better support

August.\nCompanies reported higher sales to the likes of the US, Europe, Canada, Scandinavia, and Russia.\nEmployment also increased, with jobs growth at small and medium-sized businesses offsetting further cuts at large-scale firms.\nHowever, input costs rose at their quickest pace since June, due to higher price tag across\u0026nbspelectronic components, energy, food products, metals, paper, plastics, resins and timber.\nThe foreign exchange rate also played a part in higher costs, alongside supply shortages and global inflationary pressures.\nRob Dobson, director at IHS Markit which compiles the survey, said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoSeptember saw a mild improvement in the performance of the UK manufacturing sector.\n\u0026ldquoDomestic market demand strengthened, while increased orders from North America and Europe helped new export business stage a modest recovery from August\u0026rsquos contraction.\n\u0026ldquoBusiness confidence also rose to a three-month high.\nThe survey showed that more than 53% of companies expect production to increase over the next 12 months.\n\u0026ldquoDespite these causes for short-term optimism, conditions in manufacturing are still relatively lacklustre overall, Mr Dobson said.\n\u0026ldquoMany UK manufacturers also noted that the backdrop of Brexit and a volatile exchange rate were making any forecasting activity increasingly dficult, with uncertainty adding to reluctance to hire.\nHoward Archer, chief economic adviser at the EY Item Club, said there are \u0026ldquolimited grounds for optimism.\n\u0026ldquoWhile offering some encouragement, the manufacturing sector looks to be finding it hard to regain traction after a markedly weakened performance over the first half of the year.\n\u0026ldquoThe

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.  With the help of neighbours and friends he remained at home until April, when his growing frailty led to him being admitted to Midlothian Community Hospital.  Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.  She added: \u0026ldquoDonald handled the Gospel with truth and diligence. His sermons were always topical, he was knowledgeable, articulate and had the ability to keep his hearers engaged.  \u0026ldquoHis ministry was inclusive. He made everyone welcome whether they came regularly or very occasionally, he was always encouraging and approachable.  \u0026ldquoHe procured a beautul organ built by George Holdrich in the late 1800s for a church in Appleby in the Lake District which was due to be scrapped.  \u0026ldquoDonald had it restored and installed in Musselburgh Congregational Church, where it continues to rouse worshippers today.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.  She interviews the recruits, who, after initial training, get to \u0026lsquoshadow\u0026rsquo a general adviser before going it alone with support from the session supervisor.  Musselburgh resident Andrew Aitken decided to become a volunteer adviser a year and a half ago as, even although he works, he found he had some free time on his hands.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is interesting and is good  you can be of some use to people.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom at the CAB for half a day twice a week.

The runners \u0026ndash Jenner\u0026rsquos sister Susan Gibson, along with the late minister\u0026rsquos daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace, and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess, as well as Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry and Kara\u0026rsquos husband Duncan \u0026ndash have been raising funds throughout the summer in aid of Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre.  Jenner died on March 2, aged 63, having been minister of St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Only three more events remain, with the family\u0026rsquos initial target of \u0026pound1,000 smashed as nearly \u0026pound7,000 has been raised.  Susan, who takes on the Scottish 10k \u0026ndash which starts and finishes in Musselburgh on Sunday \u0026ndash alongside Duncan, said: \u0026ldquoWe are completely blown away by the generosity we have come across. It has been a really positive thing for us.  \u0026ldquoYou just think the whole thing was completely ghastly and  something good can come out of it then that has got to be good.  \u0026ldquoIt is what Jenner wanted and I think she would be chuffed to bits about the money we have raised.  Also this weekend, Barry takes on the Belfast City Half Marathon.  The challenge ends in Glasgow next Sunday  when Elaine and Susan line up for the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon.  Susan, 61, thought that Sunday\u0026rsquos East Lothian run, which stretches from Musselburgh to Cockenzie and back, would be memorable.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only one on Jenner\u0026rsquos turf.  \u0026ldquoI think that will be a wee bit special.  Already the family have completed three events, with Elaine, 33, running the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen in May. Then Elaine lined up alongside Clare, 32, Kara, 29, Duncan, 28, and Susan for the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, in July.  The youngest members of the squad did their bit at the parkrun in Portrush, Northern Ireland, with Susan joined by Laura, 37, eight-year-old Isla, 14-year-old Ciara and Elaine.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI think we have all found it emotional \u0026ndash just when you are standing on the start line waiting and we have had the odd laugh on the way round when something has happened.  \u0026ldquoIn Aberdeen we thought it was going to pour with rain and the forecast was dreadful. It rained a bit and then went off and we said it was Jenner sorting that out for us.  Now the runners are in the home straight and each of them has been overwhelmed by the generosity of members of the public.  Initially a fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 was set before that was increased to \u0026pound3,000, but both figures have been smashed.  Susan added: \u0026ldquoI think the challenge itself was original and caught people\u0026rsquos imagination but the total is not because of us.  \u0026ldquoIt is a reflection of what Jenner was to so many people.

One week John Gillan, the owner of the pub, asked  we could try and fill a night when the Amulrees were unavailable.  \"We had a practice, everything just clicked and Yard Of Ale was born. We played every Friday and Saturday at the Golf for three years and took our name from the yard glass which hung on the wall. We were encouraged by local comedian, Billy Nimmo , to try our hand in the club cabaret scene.\"  Yard Of Ale then had many successful years on the pub and club circuit, winning the TV Times \u0027Pub Entertainers of the Year\u0027 award. The band did well on ITV\u0027s \u0027New Faces\u0027 and appeared on many television and radio shows including STV\u0026rsquos \u0027Thingummyjig\u0027 and BBC Radio Scotland\u0026rsquos \u0027Scottish Radio Orchestra Roadshow.\u0027 During this time they also supported, amongst others, Matt McGinn, Hamish Imlach and Billy Connolly, and enjoyed an extended run in the Edinburgh Festival with the legendary Tim Hardin.  They then went their separate ways with Alistair involved in solo cabaret work, Colin playing with the North Sea Gas folk group and Iain, the original guitarist, leading a rock band.  In 1992 the group reformed for a charity show at the Brunton Theatre with good friends The Mimics, a successful Musselburgh comedy showband who had also broken up previously, to mark the passing of their mentor Billy Nimmo. The event was so successful that the band decided to give it another go.  Since then its popularity has continued to grow and it has been in great demand for concerts, folk festivals, corporate s, pub, hotel and club gigs all over Scotland and when on tour in Denmark and in Ireland.  Peter Gillan, nephew of the Golf\u0026rsquos John Gillan, then joined the band when Ian retired in 1998. Having spent many years playing solo as a singer and guitarist on the folk and country scenes, his experience added yet another dimension to the band.  Walter Mowat joined Yard Of Ale in 2015 when Colin retired. Over the years he has played in a number of folk and bluegrass bands and also plays violin in the Really Terrible Orchestra.  Ian and Colin still occasionally feature with the band as deputies or for larger concerts.  Alistair and Ian each have two sons who were brought up and educated in Musselburgh.  Alistair\u0026rsquos sons were both taught at the Burgh School by Susan Macintosh, Peter\u0026rsquos we.  Peter started his working le at Brunton\u0026rsquos Wiremill and still works for Brunton Aero products as it is now. He has also become a leading light in the Musselburgh Athletic FC\u0026rsquos 1934 Club.  Alistair was a director for 20 years of the now defunct Musselburgh Fair Day Association which ran the annual trotting at Musselburgh racecourse. He also ran a youth club for a number of years in Northesk Church and was chairman of the Musselburgh Domino League for a few years.  In August,Yard of Ale played a fundraiser for Musselburgh Athletic Football Club to help them achieve their transition to senior football.  The fundraising concert for the Hollies Day Centre has been organised by Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council. The sell-out event will take place on Friday at Loretto Church Hall.

The 21-year-old ran 100 kilometres to do her bit for the charity, which is close to her heart after her gran, Margaret Taylor, had dementia for about seven years.  Rhona said: \u0026ldquoI think as well as getting the donations throughout, it really did spur me on knowing I was doing something in memory of my gran.  \u0026ldquoSo many other people were doing the same challenge and being part of something bigger really helped.  \u0026ldquoThere were a lot of days where I did not want to go out for a run, especially in the heatwave.  \u0026ldquoIt was quite hard some days to keep going.  According to Alzheimer\u0026rsquos Research UK, more than 1,700 people across the county have been diagnosed with dementia, with that figure expected to double within the next 20 years.  University student Rhona previously told the Courier she was not a keen athlete but found she had come on leaps and bounds during the challenge, which she finished at the end of August.  She said: \u0026ldquoI really improved.  \u0026ldquoI think for the first month, the improvement was so slow and I was pretty worried but one of my last runs was an eight-kilometre run.  \u0026ldquoI could only run about a tenth of that in the beginning.  \u0026ldquoOnce I got over that hump, it was crazy \u0026ndash I was adding a kilometre every week to my personal best.  \u0026ldquoFor me, time did not really matter.  \u0026ldquoIt kind of came naturally and when I did shorter runs I was noticing I was getting a lot quicker but for me it was really about getting the distances since it seemed so unreachable for me in the beginning.  Rhona got involved with Dementia Friendly Haddington when she was still at Knox Academy.  She co-organised an event with fellow Knox pupil Kate Farmer at Haddington Day Centre, which saw an entire music class provide entertainment.  Since then, she has done her bit for dementia and Alzheimer-related charities, raising \u0026pound546 through the challenge, and has not ruled out lacing up her running shoes again in the future after finding it not only improved her fitness but her mental health too.  Speaking on Friday morning, the fourth year studying film at Edinburgh Napier University added: \u0026ldquoGenuinely, the reason I missed your call was I was about to go for a run.  \u0026ldquoThat would be my first since I finished the challenge.  \"I took a week off, I think I earned a week off but I am going to try to keep it up.  \u0026ldquoI expected to get fitter but did not really expect how much of an impact it would have on my mood.  \u0026ldquoJust genuinely you go for a run and there is no way you are going to feel bad afterwards.

This has enabled the charity to deliver more than 33,000 respite nights since setting up as an independent charity.  In 2017, Leuchie House supported people with more than 35 dferent conditions to benefit from short breaks with 24-hour care.  The North Berwick resident, who will be leaving in November, said: \u0026ldquoEveryone who knows me knows how passionate I am about Leuchie House and the very special service we provide.  \u0026ldquoIt was always going to be dficult to step down, but I know I can do so feeling proud of everything we\u0026rsquove achieved.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove been honoured to experience on a daily basis just how much of a dference Leuchie makes to all the hundreds of families we support every year.  \u0026ldquoI would like to say a huge thank you to my team \u0026ndash staff and volunteers \u0026ndash for all their support and commitment.

Reports that some of their friends had been seen near the town made the magistrates fear that they may try to help the prisoners escape.  But what was troubling them more was the \u0026ldquoburdensome cost and inconvenience of incarcerating so many people. A decision on their fate was needed quickly.  The town authorities had followed the law by putting them in prison. In fact, the law was clear that they should all be executed.  But since there were women and children among them the Haddington authorities had hesitated to carry this out.  They needed guidance and instruction from the Privy Council, and so a rider was dispatched with a letter asking for instructions, and the prisoners had to wait to hear of their fate. What had these people done to be under sentence of death?  It was nothing they had done. Their crime was who they were. They were gypsies just to be a gypsy was a capital offence.  It was Arthur of Whittinghehame who had apprehended the families. The scene of this raid is not recorded.  Was it a night raid, dragging women and children from their tents? Had they been families passing en route or camped nearby. Whole families were taken, but perhaps some escaped.  Those who fled were perhaps the ones later seen near Haddington, worried and concerned about the fate of those imprisoned. No resistance seems to have been offered, for  it had, the violence would have certainly been noted and used against them.  They were accused of no crime other than that of being gypsies. It was a Privy Council edict in 1603 which first declared the death penalty for being a gypsy in Scotland.  It was written into statue by an act in 1609.  The Act called on all \u0026ldquogood subjects to apprehend gypsies and for the local authorities to imprison them and \u0026ldquoexecute to death the said Egyptians, either men or women. .  And so these families were victims of a law that aimed to ethnically cleanse Scotland of gypsies. The Act was motivated by racist hatred and the only evidence needed to condemn someone to death was a Gypsy name, being known as a gypsy, or just associating with known gypsies.  When the reply from the Privy Council arrived it was brutally clear in its instructions.  It said there was a need to set an example to \u0026ldquothe rest of that infamous byke, thereby comparing gypsies to a nest of wasps or hornets.  It continued: \u0026ldquoThe lords of secret counsel ordains the sherf of Haddington or his deputes to pronounce doom and sentence of death upon the men, and the women without children \u0026ldquothe men to be hangit and the women to be drowned.  The women with children were to be spared death, but were to be \u0026ldquoscourgit threw the burgh of Haddington and burnt on the cheek.  They would then be banished from Scotland. The Provost and bailies of Haddington were ordered to speedily carry out this sentence as stated. We can only assume these instructions were adhered to with little delay. If so, the executions will have been in public, and must have been a scene of horror, possibly witnessed by the friends and relatives.  They were not the first gypsy families to suffer this persecution. In fact a number of gypsy families living in the Roslin area of Midlothian had previously been rounded up in 1624. They had committed no crimes and kept a low profile. The Privy Council even complained that they were living \u0026ldquoas  they were lawful subjects. Their crime however, was to be \u0026ldquopart of an outlawed race and they were taken to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Tolbooth. The men were hanged and the women and children were banished from Scotland forever under pain of death.  The aim of the persecution was to rid Scotland of Gypsies all together. So Gypsy families found themselves living like the wolf, hunted and in constant danger of capture. The Act of 1609 was only part of it. An even earlier edict had empowered the masters of salt pans and coal mines to capture and enslave gypsies and other \u0026ldquovagabonds for servitude in the mines and salt pans.  Many miners and salt panners at that time would have been enslaved gypsies. In many ways, their experience of state persecution and social discrimination mirrored that of the MacGregors, a Highland clan who were proscribed at much the same time.  And like the MacGregors many gypsy families changed their names to avoid being identied.  Others felt forced to changed their lestyle and hide their true identity, while some lived on the edge, with a constant risk of imprisonment or death. This was why there was a concentration of gypsy families close to the English border, as the laws were dferent in England.  The attempt to exterminate gypsies from Scotland failed, they survived despite the persecution.  But most of the misery and injustice caused remains unrecorded by history, although is not unforgotten by the gypsy community.  In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries gypsies often shared the road with other travellers, many from the Highlands or Ireland, creating a gypsy/traveller tradition with distinct cultural dferences between them, but a shared \u0026ldquonon-settled lestyle.  But even when the laws were no longer enforced, the social attitudes towards gypsies and then also travellers excluded them.  They were too dferent in the way they looked and dressed, and especially in the way they lived their lives. They had their own language and didn\u0026rsquot fit in. So I was told when I was wee.  I grew up with derogatory comments in the playground about \u0026lsquoTinks\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoGypos\u0026rsquo. Such attitudes had been passed down by adults. Without knowing it I absorbed the idea that they were a people not to be trusted or liked. It was all self evident to me at the time because so many people were saying it.  The truth is, of course, no community is all good or all bad, and choosing to select something bad to justy a blanket prejudice of a people is racism and intolerance of dference. I was angry later that I had been taught to demonise a people I knew nothing about. I discovered their history, not just their persecution, but their cultural and economic contribution to our country. Gypsies and travellers are rightly proud of their traditions, and I believe they are not \u0026ldquoother, but an important part of Scottish le and culture.  It is sad that so many gypsy and traveller families, even today, hide their identity because of the discrimination they may face. And that discrimination still remains entrenched I think. I overheard a very loud \u0026ldquodiscussion about gypsies on a bus last week in which derogatory terms were used to describe them.  It reminded me of things I was told when I was younger, and which I once believed to be true. It echoed the language used in the 1609 Act and made my spine shiver.  I didn\u0026rsquot challenge these comments, but I think I should have, constructively and politely. But to be honest I was afraid to.  I\u0026rsquom ashamed about that \u0026ndash silence is the ground on which intolerance and hatred can grow."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-brewing-for-coffee-shop-and-drive-through-takeaway","story":"  The Motor Fuel Group has applied to East Lothian Council for planning consent for the outlet on land to the west of the existing Shell petrol filling station on Edinburgh Road.

Mrs Farana-Sherlock, who has lived in Haddington for more than three years and been involved in radio for more than a decade, added: \u0026ldquoIt is a great way of promoting ersity and gives a chance to introduce Polish culture and also a fantastic opportunity for people who might struggle with the language barrier to become aware of what is happening in their local communities.  \u0026ldquoThey are then aware of things that might affect their daily lives.

It follows a successful bid to attract volunteers to join the community project which is expected to take two years to complete.  Andrew Crummy, the artist behind the Great Tapestry of Scotland and Battle of Prestonpans Tapestry, spoke at a recent event in the Old Town Hall as did Melissa Viguier from the School of Ancient Crafts.  The Battle of Pinkie Cleugh, which took place between Wallyford, Musselburgh and Dalkeith on September 10, 1547, has been described as the largest and bloodiest conflict ever fought on Scottish soil.  It began after the English king Henry VIII\u0026rsquos attempts to secure an alliance with Scotland through the marriage of his young son Edward to the infant Mary, Queen of Scots, failed.  Part of a conflict known as the Rough Wooing, it is considered to be the first modern battle in the British Isles and a catastrophic defeat for Scotland.  Now the Pinkie Cleugh Battlefield Group is working with Mr Crummy to make sure the last pitched battle between Scottish and English armies, in which 10,000 were killed, is not forgotten.  The tapestry will be loosely based on the Marian Hangings stitched by Mary, Queen of Scots. Ms Viguier and a team of Edinburgh stitchers crafted a complete replica of the Marian hangings which can be seen at Edinburgh Castle.  The Battle of Pinkie Cleugh tapestry will take the form of a series of embroideries hung on velvet which, it is hoped, will find a permanent home at The Brunton in Musselburgh.  The Pinkie Cleugh Battlefield Group has already secured \u0026pound10,000 from the Musselburgh Common Good Fund, which will pay for the first phase of the tapestry. Chief stitcher Liz Neilson and her team will lead the work.  Volunteer stitchers are welcome to attend future workshops at the Old Town Hall from 10am to 1pm on October 13 and 27, November 10 and December 8.  Alister Hadden, treasurer of the Pinkie Cleugh Battlefield Group, said: \"We were delighted with how well attended the launch event was. It is really good to see so much work being done and we are sure the tapestry will be a huge success, and highlight this important battle.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/7898185.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"manufacturing-sees-mild-improvement-but-brexit-uncertainty-weighs-on-forecasts","story":"  The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing purchasing managers\u0026rsquo index  showed a reading of 53.8 last month, lower than the 53.0 in August \u0026ndash which itself was revised up from an original reading of 52.8.  Economists were expecting a reading of 52.5 for September.  A figure above 50 indicates growth.  Manufacturing PMI has now been above the neutral mark for 26 months.  The survey indicated that expansion was logged across all the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sub-sectors, with output growth\u0026nbsp linked to new business, rebuilding inventories and efforts to clear work backlogs,  It helped the PMI reading rise at its fastest pace in four months.  The survey showed new orders from both the domestic and foreign markets improved, with overseas demand having recovered from a \u0026ldquosolid contraction in August.  Companies reported higher sales to the likes of the US, Europe, Canada, Scandinavia, and Russia.  Employment also increased, with jobs growth at small and medium-sized businesses offsetting further cuts at large-scale firms.  However, input costs rose at their quickest pace since June, due to higher price tag across\u0026nbspelectronic components, energy, food products, metals, paper, plastics, resins and timber.  The foreign exchange rate also played a part in higher costs, alongside supply shortages and global inflationary pressures.  Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit which compiles the survey, said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoSeptember saw a mild improvement in the performance of the UK manufacturing sector.  \u0026ldquoDomestic market demand strengthened, while increased orders from North America and Europe helped new export business stage a modest recovery from August\u0026rsquos contraction.  \u0026ldquoBusiness confidence also rose to a three-month high.  The survey showed that more than 53% of companies expect production to increase over the next 12 months.  \u0026ldquoDespite these causes for short-term optimism, conditions in manufacturing are still relatively lacklustre overall, Mr Dobson said.  \u0026ldquoMany UK manufacturers also noted that the backdrop of Brexit and a volatile exchange rate were making any forecasting activity increasingly dficult, with uncertainty adding to reluctance to hire.  Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at the EY Item Club, said there are \u0026ldquolimited grounds for optimism.  \u0026ldquoWhile offering some encouragement, the manufacturing sector looks to be finding it hard to regain traction after a markedly weakened performance over the first half of the year.  \u0026ldquoThe manufacturing\u0026rsquos performance so far in 2018 has largely been in stark contrast to the robust performance seen through the second half of 2017."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8755847.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"american-pair-ski-down-from-everests-sister-peak-mount-lhotse","story":"  James Morrison and Hilaree Nelson scaled Mount Lhotse\u0026rsquos 8,516-metre  summit on Sunday with two other climbers and three Nepalese Sherpa guides, Pemba Sherpa of the Xtreme Climbers and Expeditions organisation said.

Shaped on the island. Crafted with love.  Essence of Harris is a family run candle and home fragrance business located in the heart of the Outer Hebrides in Scotland, created by couple Jamie McGowan, who is originally from Glasgow, and his partner Deenie MacLeod, a Hearach .    Co-founders of Essence of Harris, Jamie and Deenie started their journey into candle and home fragrance by pouring around 12 candles a day on their kitchen table for a small following of island locals. Since the beginning, they have followed the ethos of keeping the brand natural, local and affordable using their beautul island home as inspiration for their products.  They have grown their beloved craft into a bustling candle business, boosting employment within the fragile island economy on the Isle of Harris. Candles were one thing that they both immensely enjoyed having in their home yet there wasn\u0027t anyone creating the products in the Hebrides.  Inspired by the elements of the island, particularly the beaches, they started experimenting with dferent scents and candle making at home. However as the company grew, In its very first year they gained their very own production unit, allowing them to employ a great close-knit team, and supplying to a number of Scottish stockists including the departure lounge of Inverness Airport.  Indeed, with five luxurious scents each named after the stunning west Harris beaches, the \u0027Essence of Harris\u0027 brand is now stocked in over 40 retailers across Scotland with sales abroad also on the increase via sales reps.  There\u0027s a real interest in the candles and home fragrance among tourists who are blown away by the scenery on Harris and want to take a part of Harris home!  \u0026ldquoThe rugged natural beauty of the island inspires everything we do. The product packaging is striking and elemental to reflect the romance, charm and authenticity of the beautul Isle of Harris.

The name should be the first warning human rights reputational risk management. This is not about assessing human rights, it\u0026rsquos about assessing the potential damage to the funder\u0026rsquos reputation by association with those whose human rights records are abysmal.  That being said, even  the aim is not so noble, new guidance could still have a positive effect.  This isn\u0026rsquot really new guidance or a Scottish Government production either though. It is mostly links to work by other bodies \u0026ndash the United Nations, the Institute for Human Rights and Business, the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark Initiative and others.  Make no mistake, these are certainly useful resources, but by doing little more than signposting to external initiatives it is not clear what exactly the government is asking of its agencies providing these handouts. It\u0026rsquos impossible to avoid a feeling of this being no more than lip-service to dampen the bad press they\u0026rsquove received weekly as a result of our work.  Along with its reliance on links to other bodies, the wording of the guidance itself indicates that it is not compulsory. In its few pages, it only sets out recommendations and describes its own content as advice.  The language itself is not definitive. It suggests what kind of assessments should be conducted, but also states that the detail of what is checked is ultimately a matter of judgement by whomever has initiated the relationship. Due regard for human rights seems to rely more on agencies deciding themselves to follow the external links provided than on any clear instructions from the Scottish Government.  I\u0026rsquove asked the government to explain exactly what status this guidance has and provide copies of any human rights assessments recently carried out, to give us a clearer picture of what\u0026rsquos going on. Given the lack of transparency we\u0026rsquove faced so far, going as far as an Information Commissioner ruling that they breached Freedom of Information law, I expect this will take months yet again.  In the meantime, more children will die at the hands of arms dealers funded by the Scottish Government with public money. And the government will bury its head further into the sand."},{"url":null,"title":"unite-boss-kez-should-have-used-70k-jungle-fee-for-legal-costs","story":"  Pat Rafferty, the regional secretary of Unite, said the former Scottish Labour leader should have donated some of the \u0026pound70,000 she earned for appearing on a celebrity TV show rather than relying on Labour funds.  He also described her criticism of Labour\u0026rsquos decision to stop paying her legal bills as \u0026ldquoincredible and \u0026ldquoirresponsible.  Dugdale, who led the party for two years, is being sued for defamation by Stuart Campbell, who runs the Wings Over Scotland blog.  Labour at a UK level had originally agreed to pay her legal fees, but Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos solicitor was informed recently that the party had changed its mind.  The decision caused widespread anger as Scottish Labour members believed Ms Dugdale has been abandoned half-way through the case.  In an interview last week, Ms Dugdale said: \u0026ldquoThe Labour Party made a promise and it\u0026rsquos not a good look for any political party to fail to keep its promise.  \u0026ldquoThis is what it\u0026rsquos doing to one of its own, so how can people trust that party in any other aspect of le,  this is what\u0026rsquos happening?  But Mr Rafferty, who is the most senior figure in Unite north of the border, said the Lothians MSP could have contributed to the pot with her own cash.  Ms Dugdale, who earns over \u0026pound60,000 as an MSP, angered her colleagues last year after skipping her parliamentary duties to appear on \u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! in the jungle in Australia.  She topped up her MSP salary with a pre-tax fee of \u0026pound70,000, some of which she gave to charity.  Mr Rafferty said: \u0026ldquoSome of the comments she has been making are irresponsible, basically saying \u0026lsquoI am not getting the backing in this legal case, and so the party itself cannot be trusted\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoSome party members will be wondering whether this is the same Kezia Dugdale who was in the Australian jungle not that long ago and got \u0026pound70,000 for it. So why is it that party members should be picking up her legal fees?\"  He added: \u0026ldquoI think she should have made a contribution to the legal fees.  Mr Rafferty also said: \u0026ldquoI just think the way that Kezia has attacked the Labour party, her own party, is incredible.

However, a Freedom of Information request made by this paper has revealed that only a handful of councils immediately complied with the legislation while a number are still not complying and have no intention of doing so.  Argyll \u0026amp Bute Council, which has so far paid out a total of \u0026pound4.8m to settle claims, has not included pensions in any of its pay outs and does not plan to factor them in when dealing with the 120 outstanding claims against it. Similarly, East Ayrshire, which has paid out \u0026pound862,000 in settlements since April 2015, and East Renfrewshire, which has paid out \u0026pound511,000 in that time, have also failed to rerate the pensions of the affected women.  Fe Council, on the other hand, which paid out \u0026pound11.3m in non-pensionable settlements immediately after the legislation was updated, has included pensions in the \u0026pound36.2m it has paid out since. Fe will also factor in pensions as part of settling the 1,100 outstanding claims against it.  East Dunbartonshire, Falkirk, Highland, West Dunbartonshire and West Lothian have also included pensions in recent settlements and will do so for future ones.  The overall result of the dferent approaches is that some women face being discriminated against for the rest of their lives because of the part of the country they lived and worked in, yet no public body will claim responsibility for ensuring the law is enforced.  The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, for example, said that while inidual councils are aware of the pension regulations, \u0026ldquoit is for each employer to consider the appropriate method of settlement and agree the same with the claimants and their representatives.  Audit Scotland, meanwhile, which audits the SPPA, all 32 local authorities and the 11 pension funds that make up the Local Government Pension Scheme, admitted that it did not consider pensions as part of its 2017 report Equal Pay in Scottish Councils. It has also not included the pensions issue in any of the reports it has issued following the annual audit of each inidual authority.  Noting that there are \u0026ldquohighly complex issues around the implementation of equal pay, a spokesman for the body said it is up to local authorities to \u0026ldquoagree the pensionable elements with claimants as part of any settlement.  Even the SPPA, which forced North Lanarkshire Council to include pensions in its settlements after being asked to intervene in 2016, said it has \u0026ldquono powers under pensions legislation to ensure compliance.  \u0026ldquoCouncils are independent bodies of the Scottish Government so negotiations entered into to settle equal-pay claims are a matter for them, an SPPA spokeswoman said. \u0026ldquoIf dferent agreements have been reached it\u0026rsquos for the councils to have ensured they are appropriate and compliant.  Stefan Cross QC of Action4Equality Scotland, who led the case against North Lanarkshire, said this shows that public bodies are \u0026ldquopassing the buck on the issue and failing to uphold the rights of the women the pensions legislation is designed to protect.  \u0026ldquoThe women are left dangling because none of the authorities will take responsibility for upholding the law, he said.  Peter Hunter of the trade union Unison agreed and said that as some women have been receiving the incorrect pension for over a decade, while others have died without ever receiving what they were entitled to, the Scottish Government should intervene.  \u0026ldquoPay is pensionable and therefore equal-pay settlements are pensionable. All this is crystal clear in the law, rulings and guidance on pensions so non-payment of pension contributions for low-paid women is yet another example,  one were needed, of the fact that public bodies need to wake up, he said.  \u0026ldquoMany councils still don\u0026rsquot pay equally, pension fund administrators are inactive in the face of missing millions and auditors still can\u0026rsquot grasp the cost and risk of systemic inequality.  \u0026ldquoThis is a complete system failure. Government has the power to act and the time for action is long overdue.  Despite this, a Scottish Government spokesman, who did not answer questions relating specically to pensions, reiterated the SPPA\u0026rsquos viewpoint that local as opposed to central government should deal with anything related to equal pay.  \u0026ldquoWe have made clear we believe pay discrimination is unacceptable and that equal pay claims should be settled as quickly as possible, he said.  \u0026ldquoAs such as we would urge councils, in line with their legal obligations as employers, to resolve any outstanding claims.  Equal pay and pensions: The history  THE Equal Pay Act 1970 made it illegal for employers to offer men and women dferent employment terms, but it wasn\u0026rsquot until 1997 that a UK-wide agreement was put in place to ensure all local authorities complied with the legislation.  It then took until 2010 for all Scottish councils to implement the so-called single status agreement, with most paying compensation to female workers who had been discriminated against up to that point.  Despite this, all councils went on to receive further equal-pay claims in relation to single status itself. The issues raised included the fact that bonuses that only male staff had been entitled to were protected under the new scheme while the job evaluation element of single status deemed some roles done mainly by women to be less valuable than those done mostly by men.\u0026nbsp  In both rounds of claims most councils treated their settlements as compensation, meaning they were neither taxable nor pensionable. In 2014 HMRC ordered that practice to stop, stressing that all equal-pay settlements must be treated as arrears of pay, with tax and pension contributions becoming due as a result. The rules of the Scottish Local Government Pension Scheme were updated to clary the point in the same year.  Not all councils complied, however. In North Lanarkshire, affected women took legal action against their local authority in a bid to have their pensions - which are calculated based on salary - increased to the level they would have been at had they not been underpaid.  In 2016 the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Scottish Public Pensions Agency ordered the council to abide by the law. The effect was to increase the amount the affected women had been paid in the years they were making claims for and, as a result, their pension entitlement too.  The SPPA wrote to all public bodies in the wake of the North Lanarkshire case to \u0026ldquoclary the policy intent that a payment of arrears of pay, made in respect of an equal-pay claim, should be treated as pensionable.  Equal pay and pensions: The impact  LIZ Melrose, who is enjoying a late summer holiday in Tenere, is looking forward to retiring at the end of this year after putting in a 25-year sht at North Lanarkshire Council.  Yet while the thought of entering the next phase of her le is an enticing one, Mrs Melrose admits that money will be tight to begin with because she is taking early retirement and so won\u0026rsquot receive the state pension for another two years.  Despite this, thanks to a fight put up by her and fellow North Lanarkshire staff, the home support worker will be almost \u0026pound1,500 a year better off than she expected to be because the equal-pay settlement she received from the council in 2015 has finally been reflected in her pension.  As a result, Mrs Melrose\u0026rsquos retirement income will rise from \u0026pound5,695 to \u0026pound7,133 a year when she clocks off for the final time in December. While the numbers are not huge, when her state entitlement is factored in in two years\u0026rsquo time it will make the dference, Mrs Melrose says, between being able to continue to take holidays in retirement and not.  \u0026ldquoThat \u0026pound1,500 a year is a substantial increase, she says.  A retired care home warden is in a similar position. Having stopped work 11 years ago after 30 years of service, also with North Lanarkshire Council, the 71-year old had been receiving the incorrect pension every month in the intervening period until, three months ago, it was bumped up by 30 per cent.  It has, she says, \u0026ldquomade quite a big dference to her and her husband\u0026rsquos lives. Her husband agrees, noting that the couple no longer has to be quite so \u0026ldquoguarded about what we\u0026rsquore spending and what we\u0026rsquore not spending.  Yet the outcome is bittersweet, with the woman\u0026rsquos husband noting that due to ill health his we is no longer able to fully enjoy the extra money.  \u0026ldquoThis would have made a big dference to us, a substantial dference, but my we\u0026rsquos heath has deteriorated and deteriorated and she can\u0026rsquot go abroad now because she can\u0026rsquot get insurance, he says.  \u0026ldquoWe both worked all our days and were in the habit of going on a Continental holiday every year until her ill health prevented that. [If the correct pension had been paid from the start] we might have been able to have a winter holiday and a summer holiday.  \u0026ldquoWhen you get to our age you are on the downward slope as regards time."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-denies-knowing-about-alex-salmond-allegation-five-years-ago","story":"  It was reported yesterday that Mr Salmond, who is facing claims of sexual harassment, apologised to a woman for a \u0026ldquomisunderstanding in 2013 and that \u0026ldquono action was taken by the Government.  A Government spokesperson said Ms Sturgeon, who was Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos deputy at the time, had not been aware of concerns raised by the woman.  In January, two women accused Mr Salmond of sexual misconduct when he was First Minister, allegations that were investigated by civil servants.  The probe led to the Government handing over the findings last month to Police Scotland, which has since launched its own investigation.  As revealed by the Herald on Sunday, the police probe is examining a twenty-month period spanning March 2013 to November 2014 - the last month of Salmond\u0026rsquos time in office.  Mr Salmond angrily denounced the internal Government probe, describing the procedure and unlawful and unfair. He denies any sexual harassment and is challenging the civil service process by way of a judicial review.  It was claimed yesterday that one of the women who came forward this year had also made the complaint five years ago.  According to the account, the complaint was resolved after the woman accepted Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos apology for the \u0026ldquomisunderstanding, which took place at Bute House in Edinburgh.  The claims were said to raise questions about why civil servants ordered another investigation this year when the issue had been apparently been dealt with.  Scottish Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said:  \"It now appears a complaint was made against Alex Salmond in 2013. If that is true, it contradicts what the public has previously been told about when issues around Mr Salmond\u0027s conduct were first raised, and who dealt with them. It is essential the public is now given a clear timeline of events that have lead to this point, including who knew what - and when.\"  In response to the story, a Scottish Government spokesperson said:  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government received two complaints in January in relation to Alex Salmond. These could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.  \u0026ldquoNo complaints were raised with the then Deputy First Minister about Alex Salmond under the previous process and, as we have said, the first the First Minister became aware of the fact of an investigation was from Alex Salmond in April 2018.  Asked whether Ms Sturgeon had been aware that a female staffer had complained about Mr Salmond\u0027s behaviour in 2013, the spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoNo.  On whether the First Minister was aware that the woman had raised concerns about Mr Salmond\u0027s behaviour, the spokesperson gave the same response.  A spokesperson for Mr Salmond said: \u0026ldquoWe have no comment to make because our Petition for Judicial Review against the Permanent Secretary is now before the Court of Session. We expect it to be called very shortly and we intend to do our talking in court. Our objective is to establish that Scottish Government\u0026rsquos complaints procedure used against Alex is unlawful."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-on-sunday-letters-brexit-flags-ferries-and-shouting-at-clouds","story":"  The dficulty, as I see it, which underlies everything we do with the EU, is that the political leadership of other 27 countries thinks that Europe is a GOOD thing whereas the political leadership of the UK does not.

Martin Redfern  Edinburgh  CHEQUERED PAST OF OUR OWN FLAG  Your story on PoliceScotland\u0027s list of prohibited flags News, September 23 raised some interest. The current saltire is connected to conflict and tension, the inspiration being the cloud formed St Andrew\u0027s cross the Pict army allegedly saw above the battlefields of Athlestaneford in 832. Today it is the civic symbol and also grasped by those pushing for fresh independence referenda.  Flags are not merely innocent fluttering fabric, as police lists attest. They are cementers of nationalism and carriers often purveyors of power and hate. Nationalism is oft formed by what \u0027we are not\u0027 as opposed to defining positively \u0027what we are.\u0027 The saltire, with its links to wars with English Angles, fits that construct.  Of course the blue and white saltire was not always our flag. A black and white, green and white, and red and white saltire have all been committed to cloth before our extant national symbol.  Flags can of course change. If we were to change, I would like to see purple in our saltire. Not only a salute to women suffragettes\u0027 campaign for democracy, but also a symbol of our heathered landscape and thistle. What better positive affirmation of the county than the glorious landscapes we are blessed to be born and/or live amidst.

You would think that Police Scotland had more to worry about than the waving of offensive flags. The flags are an outward expression of thoughts and beliefs, proscribing the display of potentially offensive flags does nothing the address the underlying statement.

An internal document obtained by the Herald on Sunday reveals there are now three merger options on the table, two of which would see officers working in Scotland still employed by British Transport Police Authority, with the Scottish Police Authority  given oversight. When the plan to devolve railway policing was first mooted, three options were suggested by BTP.  But Yousaf\u0026rsquos predecessor Michael Matheson, who is now transport minister, rejected the first two options and spent three years trying to force a takeover of the work of BTP in Scotland. Matheson and Yousaf swapped jobs in First Minister Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos summer cabinet reshuffle.  A discussion paper marked \u0026ldquoOFFICIAL circulated to key stakeholders this week at a meeting chaired by Scottish Government civil servants shows that three options are now under consideration. Option one is a \u0026ldquonon-statutory governance arrangement involving BTP and the SPA, option two is described as a \u0026ldquostatutory route which would give the SPA \u0026ldquoenhanced accountability, and option three is \u0026ldquofull integration, a policy the Scottish Government pursued when Matheson was justice minister. Option three could take eight years to implement, according to the report.  Rail trade union the Transport Salaried Staffs\u0027 Association , which represents BTP staff in Scotland, said the Scottish Government had performed a \u0026ldquoU-turn and called on Sturgeon to sack Matheson for \u0026ldquoincompetence.  Scottish Liberal Democrat justice spokesman Liam McArthur said millions of pounds had been spent on an \u0026ldquounworkable merger and Yousaf should now \u0026ldquojunk the original plan altogether.  The s of BTP in Scotland were due to be absorbed into the national force in April next year but Matheson announced in February that the merger had been postponed, amid concerns about IT and pensions arrangements.  The move followed a scathing report from Scotland\u0027s police watchdog which said no authoritative business case was made for the integration. HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland, Derek Penman, said a detailed study of the risks should be undertaken.  Penman praised BTP officers and staff for their professionalism amid uncertainty about their position. BTP has 213 officers, 38 police staff and 26 special officers in Scotland, who are charged with looking after 358 stations and 1700 miles of track.  After Yousaf took over the justice department, he announced he would \u0026ldquore-examine all options for the devolution of railway policing, which was originally recommended by the cross-party Smith Commission in 2014.  A Joint Programme Board  was set up in 2017 to integrate BTP in Scotland into Police Scotland. It is chaired by the Scottish Government and UK government\u0026rsquos Department for Transport , and includes representatives from BTP, the SPA and Police Scotland.  A JPB paper circulated this week set out the three options and said each of them \u0026ldquowill be tested on merit as a standalone solution to deliver devolved accountability and responsibility or as part of a phased approach which may progress to full integration to achieve the desired aim.  The report said the SPA does not currently have the s to deliver railway policing. This echoes an SPA report presented to the body\u0026rsquos finance committee last month which said some services may have to be outsourced, resulting in \u0026ldquosignicant dferences to the actual cost base for Police Scotland in integrating BTP-Scotland.  The JPB report, obtained by the Herald on Sunday, states: \u0026ldquoThe options appraisal will provide an evidence-based comparison, considering strategic fit with recommendations from the Smith Commission benefits case risks/impact to the safe and effective management and operational delivery of railway policing in Scotland and the UK and costs \u0026ndash including value for money and affordability.  The document said the timeframe to \u0026ldquogenerate, capture and test the three options will be just over two months, and the justice minister will update the cabinet in early December, with an update provided to MSPs who sit on the Scottish Parliament\u0026rsquos justice committee by the end of the year.  TSSA leader Manuel Cortes said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s taken three long years for the Scottish Government to finally accept what our members have told it from the outset \u0026ndash that the breakup of BTP and its merger with Police Scotland was unnecessary and unfeasible.  \u0026ldquoIt continues to be unwanted by anyone connected with our railways in Scotland because it puts passengers and our members at peril. Let\u0027s face it, BTP and Police Scotland themselves never wanted it either.  \u0026ldquoThe U-turn is the right thing to do. It\u0027s just a crying shame it\u0027s taken them so long to make it. The paper circulated at the Joint Programme Board earlier this week represents a signicant change of heart away from the entrenched nationalism surrounding the earlier decision by former justice minister Michael Matheson.  Cortes praised Yousaf for \u0026ldquohaving the decency to review the merger and the \u0026ldquopolitical courage to force his party to accept that it made a mistake.  The union leader said BTP staff and officers deserve an apology and \u0026ldquorecompense for the unnecessary amount of stress and anxiety forced upon them by Matheson\u0027s idiotic policy for the last three years.  An impact report by the Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research  found that 83 per cent of staff and officers who took part in a survey were unsupportive of the merger. \u0026ldquoThe responses to the online survey demonstrated a deep strain of scepticism, cynicism and opposition towards the integration of BTP s into devolved policing structures, said the report.  Co-author of the SCCJR report Dr Kath Murray welcomed the decision to consider the original options. \u0026ldquoIt suggests a sht away from full integration as an end in its own right, towards an effective devolution arrangement, the criminal justice researcher told the Herald on Sunday. \u0026ldquoRetaining the single specialist service within a devolved accountability structure would allow railway policing in Scotland to be underpinned by principles set by the Scottish Government, build on the respective strengths of the BTP and Police Scotland, and crucially, remove the signicant challenges to date, including the risks to public safety and costs to the public purse.  The TSSA\u0026rsquos Cortes said reasoned arguments made to Matheson about the impact of the merger on staff and officers fell on \u0026ldquodeaf ears. \u0026ldquoHe never once got that safety and crime prevention on our railways is far too important to be treated like a political football, he said.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s why we now have deep reservations about his position as transport secretary. Put simply, nobody in our business trusts the man or has any confidence in him. Yousaf\u0027s decision to overturn the injustice done to transport police staff is an indication of Matheson\u0026rsquos lack of judgement. And frankly, Matheson should be made to resign for his incompetence. It\u0027s inconceivable that he can carry on in the transport brief.  Cortes added: \u0026ldquoWhilst I welcome the Joint Programme Board\u0027s latest thinking, make no mistake, this is also an embarrassing climbdown for the SNP. If they want us to believe they have integrity when it comes to security and transport policy then they don\u0027t just need to sink this dangerous and mindless merger proposal, they need to sack Matheson who has no right to expect trust to be vested in him again.  Scottish Liberal Democrat justice spokesman Liam McArthur said: \u0026ldquoWhen alternative, less risky options were put forward the Scottish Government dismissed them in a high-handed fashion, choosing instead to barrel ahead with the abolition of the BTP in Scotland without even bothering to develop a proper business case.  \u0026ldquoThat decision cost millions of pounds, shredded the confidence of staff and took us back to square one. It\u0026rsquos no wonder that officer\u0027s representatives have been so critical of ministers\u0027 handling .  \u0026ldquoFor BTP officers and staff the future remains uncertain. The new justice secretary needs to junk the original plan altogether, given two years of work has shown it to be unworkable, and squarely focus on the other viable options for the future of this service.  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \u0026ldquoAs the Justice Secretary highlighted to the Justice Committee recently, there is a need to identy interim arrangements that could give effect quickly to the devolution of railway policing, as recommended by the Smith Commission.  \u0026ldquoIn August, the Justice Secretary committed to re-examining all options with Police Scotland, the Scottish Police Authority, the British Transport Police and other partners. This process is currently underway and is being discussed by the Joint Programme Board. An update on the next steps will be provided in due course.    TIMELINE OF AN ATTEMPTED MERGER  Smith Commission published its report on further devolution of powers to the Scottish Parliament and railway policing was one of those areas.  British Transport Police sets out three options for future devolution of transport policing in Scotland. The third option \u0026ndash breaking up BTP and amalgamating Scottish operations into Police Scotland \u0026ndash is described as the \u0026ldquomost complex. This option would have implications for employment and pension arrangements, as well as financial and legal liabilities.  Scotland Act 2016 is given royal assent, which passed the recommendations of the Smith Commission into law.  The Scottish Government launched a consultation on option three, the integration of railway policing.  Consultation responses are published, showing \u0026ldquomuch opposition to the policy. \u0026ldquoMany considered that a strong case for integration had not been made, said the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos executive summary.  A survey of TSSA members found a third would leave BTP in the event of a merger.  The Railway Policing  Act was passed and TSSA launched a petition opposing the merger, which attracted more than 11,000 supporters  The merger, which was due to be implemented in April 2019, was postponed by former justice minister Michael Matheson.  New justice minister Humza Yousaf announces a review which will explore further options.    THE 2015 AND 2018 OPTIONS    Option One  This option is the simplest route to achieve devolution \u0026ndash that is, through administrative means, rather than legislation.  Option Two  This option consists of a number of measures, both legislative and administrative, to devolve transport policing within Scotland.  Option Three  This is the most complex route to devolution and it would entail breaking up BTP and absorbing its Scottish operations into Police Scotland.    Option 1  Establish a governance arrangement  through BTPA and SPA .  Option 2  Establish a model for SPA enhanced accountability and responsibility in the delivery of railway policing in Scotland .  Option 3  Proceed to full integration, with date to be informed by Police Scotland ."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-government-backs-greater-human-rights-checks-on-firms-after-dodgy-10bn-china-deal","story":"  Public bodies will also have to undertake stricter due diligence on potential commercial partners in the wake of the Government\u0026rsquos botched \u0026pound10bn investment agreement with a Chinese consortium.  In 2016, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon signed a \u0026ldquomemorandum of understanding with SinoFortone and China Railway No. 3 Engineering Group  at Bute House.  At the time, SinoFortone said the partnership could lead to \"signicant investment\" in areas including clean energy, transport and affordable housing in Scotland.  Ms Sturgeon did not publicise the agreement when it was struck and details only came to light after reports surfaced in the Chinese press.  It then emerged that CR3 parent company, China Railway Group , had been blacklisted by Norway\u0026rsquos oil fund following corruption allegations.  The ethics council of the Norwegian pension fund warned in 2014 there was a \"high degree of probability\" the firm \"paid bribes to government officials for contracts regarding construction of railways and housing projects\" in China.  The negative publicity was followed by the companies withdrawing from the memorandum and the proposal collapsed.  It was then revealed last year that the London-registered SinoFortune had failed to carry out many of the projects it had been linked to.  The report stated that the firm had not registered any company accounts and the only deal it had finalised was the purchase of a Buckinghamshire pub - the Plough Inn at Cadsden.  Sir Richard Heygate, who was SinoFortune\u0026rsquos UK agent, later described the firm as \u0026ldquoall bollocks. He added: \u0026ldquoIt shows how careless the first minister was to put pen to paper on a deal with Chinese companies she knew absolutely nothing about.\"  In June, the Government released its \u0026ldquoengagement strategy with China, but it also published a \u0026ldquoguidance document on due diligence and human rights for public bodies.  According to the recommendations, the Government and its quangos should assess whether a company, including a parent firm or subsidiary, has been linked to human rights abuses anywhere in the world. The checks would apply to where \u0026ldquodirect financial support is provided through grants, loans, financial investments and equity shares.  Non-financial support, such as when the Government acts as a broker between \u0026ldquotwo or more private sector partners, would also be put under the microscope.  Ministers have insisted the \u0026ldquoinitial checking should take place ahead of any meetings and more \u0026ldquosubstantive due diligence should occur as the relationship \u0026ldquodevelops and deepens.  The document also notes: \u0026ldquoCan the organisation or investor provide assurance on financial viability? Does it have any past record of financial wrongdoing, for example bribery or corruption?  Two months after the guidance was published, it was revealed that jobs quango Scottish Enterprise had given arms manufacturer Raytheon nearly \u0026pound200,000 between 2014 and 2017.  Raytheon makes guidance systems for Paveway missiles, which have been used by Saudi Arabia for bombings in Yemen.  Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: \"It shouldn\u0027t taken 15 months to produce this guidance after Keith Brown had to apologise to Parliament for signing a dodgy deal with some shady companies. These new proposals need to be rigorously enforced on and we will be keeping a close eye on whether they\u0026rsquore up to the job.\"  A Scottish Government spokesperson said the guidance produced is sufficient."},{"url":null,"title":"young-man-24-whose-disappearance-is-out-of-character-may-be-in-glasgow","story":"  Justin Conroy, 24, was reported missing by his family.

The MP for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine said the party had become \u0026ldquocomplacent, quite lazy and possibly embarrassed to explain what we as Conservatives stand for and what we believe in.  He went on: \u0026ldquoWe have allowed others to define us and our beliefs \u0026ndash we saw that last week[at the Labour conference] in Liverpool \u0026ndash and to misrepresent us and our politics. We have become reactive and definitely not pro-active.  \u0026ldquoWe have ceded the word \u0026lsquohope\u0026rsquo to the Left. We have simply vacated the battlefield in this country and given Labour and the SNP a monopoly on what is called the hope of change. It may be down to the nature of Conservatism not for us the soaring rhetoric of Obama or the passion of Jeremy Corbyn. But we in this country and in this party are facing an existential crisis.  Mr Bowie, who is the parliamentary private secretary to the Culture Department, said there was a crisis of confidence in the capitalism itself, noting how a recent study found 51 per cent of millennials did not believe it was a force for good.  The 30-year-old politician pointed out that the UK party had its lowest proportion of 18 to 35-year-old votes ever and the number of young people aged under 30 who were Tory members stood at less than 10,000.  This, he pointed out was despite, evidence that trade had lted more people out of poverty than communism or socialism ever had, that capitalism had helped people to develop thoughts to become richer than ever before and the Tories had overseen a fall in youth unemployment by 40 per cent since 2010.  \u0026ldquoWe need to start communicating, declared Mr Bowie. \u0026ldquoWe need to get a bit more passionate about what Conservatism actually is\u0026hellipwhy we represent hope and change.  He stressed that liberal Conservatives needed to win the \u0026ldquonext battle of communication, that requires passion, excitement and belief by promoting the core Tory values of freedom, liberty, personal responsibility and equality of opportunity to \u0026ldquolight up the lives of a new generation.  The Scottish Conservative MP added: \u0026ldquoIf we, the leaders of Centre Right politics in this country, can\u0026rsquot get passionate about them and can\u0026rsquot communicate to a new generation, who don\u0026rsquot remember the Cold War or the great battle between the Right and Left in the 1970s and 1980s in this country, then we are truly lost.  Meanwhile, Baroness Mobarik, an MEP, who has taken a leave of absence from the House of Lords while she serves at the European Parliament, urged her party to put forward candidates who more reflected the ersity of Scottish society.  She told the same fringe event that she had spoken at the Scottish Conservatives\u0026rsquo annual meeting in Perth and the only non-white person in the audience was her husband.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos a problem. For all our continuing success, we cannot claim to be a party for all of Scotland  our membership doesn\u0026rsquot reflect the communities we serve, she declared.  Lady Mobarik also noted how, among elected Scottish Tories, she was the \u0026ldquoonly non-white in an elected position ever and, after March, we\u0026rsquoll be back to zero again.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove never had a Scottish Conservative MP or MSP elected from an ethnic minority background.

But with less than three weeks to go to the crunch October European Council, Mr Raab will use his keynote speech to the Conservative conference in Birmingham to rule out any deal which \"locks in\" Britain to the EU by membership of a customs union or the European Economic Area.  He will also reject the European Commission\u0027s proposal for a \"backstop\" solution to the Irish border issue under which Northern Ireland would remain part of the EU customs area.  The Secretary of State will say: \"We are leaving the European Union in fact not just in name. If we can\u0027t obtain a deal that secures that objective... an attempt is made to lock us in via the back door of the EEA and customs union...or  the only offer from the EU threatens the integrity of our Union, then we will be left with no choice but to leave without a deal.\"  Restating his backing for Mrs May\u0027s Chequers Plan, Mr Raab will say: \"My approach to Brexit is pragmatic, not dogmatic.

Mr Raab\u0026rsquos words follow remarks from Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, who hit out at the EU for \"taunting\" the UK since its rejection of the Chequers Plan at the Salzburg summit.  The first day of conference was dominated by the party\u0026rsquos Brexit psychodrama with Theresa May and her colleagues defending her compromise proposals against Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos attack in which he branded them \u0026ldquoderanged.  The Prime Minister insisted her beleaguered Chequers Plan was not dead as she refused to rule out making any more compromises to secure a deal.  She sought to reject Mr Johnson\u0026rsquos suggestion that, as a true believer in Brexit, his \u0026ldquosuper-Canada trade deal plan was better placed to succeed than her blueprint, by declaring: \u0026ldquoI believe in Brexit.  Mrs May also did not deny that a no-deal scenario would create a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, simply stating repeatedly that the UK Government was \"committed\" to ensuring that a hard border would not happen.  Ruth Davidson came to the PM\u0026rsquos defence, suggesting Mr Johnson\u0026rsquos harsh putdown of her Brexit compromise was \u0026ldquonot wise and called for Tory colleagues to observe a \u0026ldquoperiod of silence to give Mrs May the space to secure a deal.  Today in her address to conference, the Scottish Conservative leader will strike out again at the former Foreign Secretary and his fellow Brexiteers by extolling the Conservative virtues of pragmatism and practicality and decrying the \u0026ldquoivory-towered schemes of the ideological puritan.  She will tell conference: \u0026ldquoHere\u0026rsquos the truth: we can agree a Brexit deal under the Conservatives or we can risk handing the keys of Downing Street to Jeremy Corbyn. I know which one I believe is in the national interest. I stand by the Prime Minister.  Last night, Mrs May failed to turn up at the Scottish Conservative reception or indeed any other reception in a bid, said party sources, to \"save her voice\" and avoid a repeat of last year\u0026rsquos embarrassing episode when she lost it repeatedly during her end-of-conference speech. Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, filled in for the PM at the Scots event.  Earlier, the PM unveiled a plan for a Festival of Brexit Britain to celebrate our \u0026ldquoprecious Union planned for 2022.

These include traditional Scottish fayre and feature a whole host of soloists in particular the unmistakable skirl of the pipes.Gordon Michie, head of fundraising, said: “It is a privilege for Poppyscotland to be in partnership with such a talented group of musicians. “The tour is providing a great opportunity for music lovers across the country to experience the unmistakable and memorable sound of Scotland’s State Band.                                                                                                         “We urge the public to get their hands on tickets for the performance as soon as possible as they are already selling out fast.”As well as the tour itself, the band is undertaking another fundraising effort in the form of The 1918 Poppy Pledge. Not only is this a lasting tribute to those who fell in the First World War, but, importantly, will also allow the Poppyscotland to make a step change in the scale of support it is able to provide those in the Armed Forces community who rely on the charity’s support today.

His parents, Josiah and Margaret , had lost 11 children in infancy.Josiah had two spells as provost of Wick and succeeded Robert Innes of Thrumster as agent for the Commercial Bank.

He argued for the inclusion of a broch as an example of native architecture as part of the Great Exhibition and wrote a paper advocating the extension of treasure trove to objects other than precious materials.His failing health took him to warmer climes, where he studied and published extensively.He bequeathed a number of legacies to his native Wick, including the establishment of an institute \"for the industrial training of young women\" at Rhind House, and provided for two scholarships at Edinburgh University.Monday 1 Oct 2018 10:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Blackmail claims over mums to be","story":"A WHISTLEBLOWER at Raigmore Hospital has alleged that midwives were \u0026ldquoblackmailed into taking on patients from Elgin in order to prevent Caithness mums-to-be from travelling to Glasgow to give birth.The midwe, whose identity has been concealed on request as the person is contracted to NHS Highland, said that due to maternity services at Dr Gray\u0026rsquos Hospital in Elgin being downgraded, expectant mums in Moray had to travel to Inverness to give birth.A large percentage of women in Caithness also have to travel to Raigmore.The additional workload from Elgin has led to anger among midwery staff who are also aggrieved that pregnant Caithness women were allegedly used as a bargaining chip.The whistle-blower said: \u0026ldquoThe maternity services at Elgin were downgraded and that meant an influx of new patients on top of the ones we already have from Caithness.\u0026ldquoWe made it clear to management that we were overworked as it is and a new batch of expectant mums would increase that even further.\u0026ldquoWe asked  they could be erted to Aberdeen but we were told  we refused to take on Elgin patients then the Caithness ones would be removed from our workload.\u0026ldquoEssentially, that meant that women would have to travel all the way from Caithness to Glasgow in order to give birth.\u0026ldquoWe did not want that to happen and we reluctantly took on the extra workload.\u0026ldquoThis comes at a time of year when all the Christmas surprises come into the world.

We could fit all 73 London constituencies in my constituency, and have room left over around the sides.\u0026ldquoThe proposed changes are simply an example of the Boundary Commission running mad and it undermines democracy.\u0026ldquoWith the best will in the world, it is very hard to cover the communities within my constituency, even when driving hither and thither.\u0026ldquoThe point is that constituencies and communities have a right of access to their elected member.\u0026ldquoDespite doing what I hope is my best,  there is a shortfall in what I can do in terms of reaching out, why would I not suggest that there is a slight democratic deficit?\u0026ldquoWhen an idea is stark raving bonkers, like this one, it just has to be said loud and clear.\u0026ldquoI will, of course, contest the seat at the next election. I may not hold the seat, as I may be voted out, but whoever represents the seat will have a very dficult time representing those good people  the constituency gets any bigger.SNP MSP Gail Ross, who holds the Holyrood seat of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross, stated that the proposed changes were unacceptable even though they could in theory help her party to win Mr Stone\u0026rsquos seat.\u0026ldquoThat will be up to the electorate but I would rather we win a seat by having a good candidate and policies that appeal to voters than because the seat has been given extra territory, she said.\u0026ldquoI share Jamie\u0026rsquos concerns as my own ward for Holyrood is a massive challenge for me to get around it.\u0026ldquoDespite all the technology in place, such as Skype and WhatsApp, you need to visit all the parts of your constituency to see what is going on and to properly speak with constituents face to face.\u0026ldquoI have colleagues who hold seats in urban areas who are shocked by the amount of travelling I have to do to meet and listen to constituents.\u0026ldquoWe need more representation and smaller wards so that the electorate can be properly served by their MP and MSP.\u0026ldquoAs for the proposed name change of the Westminster seat to \u0026lsquoHighland North\u0026rsquo, that will see Caithness taken off the political map.\u0026ldquoIt will also be name that\u0026rsquos misleading as to how big the constituency is.

However, Ms Oag believes it is leading to a surge in the number of abandoned and ill-treated animals.\"It\u0027s not fair on them to be sold alongside kids\u0027 bikes and unused furniture,\" she said. \"Too many people are just not taking responsibility.

Because of the sharp turn from River Street up the Clf Road the lorries are required to reverse all the way up from Wick harbour after the blades are loaded on their trailers by crane. They then negotiate the turn up the Clf from River Street and can proceed as normal.All possible obstacles are temporarily repositioned and in the case of River Street this means folding over a hinged lamp-post so the blade tip doesn\u0027t hit it as the lorry turns.The three McFadyens trucks were monitored by the company\u0027s support vehicles and road policing officers.The Senvion MM92 turbine comes in eight pieces that the haulage company conveys to the site in convoys that never go beyond three lorries.Bad a\u0027 Cheo wind farm, which began construction in March 2017, will feature 13 of these 2.05MW turbines with a tip height of 112 metres.Monday 1 Oct 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September 30, 2018 at 12:00 pmAdvertorial: Specsavers\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However Scottish Water has been in regular contact with stakeholders and I will wait to hear the assurances given to the community next week.\"The event will run between 3.30pm and 7.30pm on Monday.Share your views on the proposals by emailing newsdesk@spp-group or writing to us at the address on our letters page.Monday 1 Oct 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

If you look around the Highlands we are blessed with the most beautul scenery, but much of it can be hilly.\"This would provide a 6km path with no steep climbs or gradients and that could be a unique feature \u0026ndash certainly unique for around here.\"Mr Macauley said \u0026pound500,000 in total\u0026nbsp would be needed to complete the project, which he hoped would be possible \"in a few years.\"Planning permission and landowner agreement have recently been granted for the next stage and an application for finance has been lodged with the Scottish Rural Development Fund .Mr Macauley said: \"It is an excellent project with a lot of potential to bring a lot of good to the community.

Two years ago we tackled the seven-mile course when he was only six, this time we walked from Aultbea to Poolewe and have again raised a fantastic amount thanks to our generous supporters,\" said Tom.\"Unlike some Huntington\u0026rsquos disease charities 100 per cent of the money raised for the SHA goes to supporting families living with the condition. They leave research funding to others which, is great for families like us who rely so much on the support they offer.\"Since my we Helen was diagnosed 15 years ago they have been invaluable to our family and our caseworker Gordon Bogan has been immense in helping us cope.\"SHA supports Huntington\u0026rsquos disease families through a national network of specialists, a world leading youth support team and its financial wellbeing service.Huntington\u0026rsquos disease is a complex condition with symptoms that typically begin to develop between the ages of 30 and 50. It causes three main groups of symptoms: changes to thinking processes \u0026ndash a type of early onset dementia loss of muscle control and involuntary movements which lead to loss of speech and swallow, along with mental illness.Those impacted by Huntington\u0026rsquos disease may lose the ability to walk, talk, eat, drink or make decisions and will eventually need 24-hour care. It is also hereditary with each child of those diagnosed at 50 per cent risk of developing the disease. There is currently no cure.It is estimated there are around 1100 people living with Huntington\u0026rsquos disease in Scotland and up to 6000 potentially at risk.\"Now that we have completed the middle distance I think Jacob will be keen on tackling the full 25 miles pretty soon, although I\u0026rsquom not sure  I\u0026rsquoll be joining him without some serious training,\" added Tom.Anyone interested in fundraising for the SHA should contact Linda Winters on 0141 848 0308 or email linda.winter@hdscotland.orgMonday 1 Oct 2018 10:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is thought the smaller site would close  the new store went ahead, although Co-op Food had not responded by the time the Ross-shire Journal went to print.The applicant, Northquest Ltd, has also earmarked two further building plots for possible future development within the proposed store\u0026rsquos grounds \u0026ndash another 6000 sq ft building and one covering 2500 sq ft.The store would be accessed via Ness Road and have parking for 79 cars and two motorbikes. The access road also features a bell-shaped junction at its far end, opening up the possibility that nearby land may also be developed in the future  the site went ahead.The Fortrose and Rosemarkie Community Council has unanimously opposed the proposals, citing concerns over its location within a designated buffer zone that is designed to keep Fortrose and Rosemarkie from merging into one.Chairman Tom Heath said the community council felt the application fell foul of two elements of the local development plan, the first of which was its location.He added: \u0026ldquoThe second is that we were concerned of the effects it would have on the rest of the High Street and the viability of the remainder of the businesses on High Street [ it relocated].Those reactions have been shared by some residents, who have been responding to a consultation launched by the community council.While many welcomed the prospect of a larger Co-op store and greater iety on its shelves, others raised fears that the existing High Street shop\u0026rsquos off-street car park could be lost in the move \u0026ndash forcing cars to park on the main road and putting greater pressure on this notorious traffic bottleneck.Others shared the community council\u0026rsquos argument that the development is on land zoned as off-limits in the local development plan.Fears had been raised that a decision last year by Highland councillors to approve a new \u0026pound4million care home within this buffer zone would set a precedent that opened up the wider area to development. It was passed despite the objection of planning officers.And this concern was shared by some of the public.Responding on Facebook to the community council\u0026rsquos call for comment, Gail Paterson said: \u0026ldquoIt will kill Fortrose High Street  allowed. The care home  has set a precedent so can\u0026rsquot see how this can be knocked back and from there on in the land will go to housing without the infrastructure being sorted out.Bridget Gerstner added: \u0026ldquoThe shop would be nice but not there. This is the foot in the door. Once we agree to this site, there will be no stopping building on the land between Fortrose and Rosemarkie.Mr Heath said the community council had taken fears over the care home\u0026rsquos impact on the buffer zone to council officers last year, and that they had been given assurances that its approval would not set a precedent.- Share your view.

A report to councillors explained how monitoring of public buildings fitted with solar panels was incomplete and that some \u0026ldquodata was calculated for two sites that had actually been deleted from the process the previous year.Worse still, despite previous agreed management action, \u0026ldquono record of eligible sites has been established, the report stated. It added: \u0026ldquoThere is no definitive site list. There is no robust system in place to capture meter readings for renewable energy from photovoltaic solar panels.Mr Black offered an apology for the audit\u0026rsquos revelations.Council leader Margaret Davidson told colleagues: \u0026ldquoOur carbon emissions are more than they should be and it\u0026rsquos costing us a lot of money. That can\u0026rsquot be changed unless we\u0026rsquove got accurate management and record keeping.She said she would request that officials review the processes, how decisions are made within the relevant department and the scrutiny of the work it does.Speaking afterwards, councillor Roddy Balfour, a colleague in the minority independent administration said it amounted to \u0026ldquogross incompetence.He said he hoped the audit and scrutiny committee, which is chaired by opposition SNP councillor Graham MacKenzie, would ensure that the issues would be urgently addressed and keep the council within national guidelines associated with climate change policies.Highlands and Islands Green MSP John Finnie, a former councillor, said: \u0026ldquoThe council\u0026rsquos latest bungle is seriously concerning. It\u0026rsquos failed to collect data which is necessary to assess its contribution to tackling climate change.

Also scheduled is a revamp of the heating system to make it more economic and efficient and modernisation of the toilets.Additional space for rental is also part of the plans. A spokeswoman for the group said: \u0026ldquoWe anticipate that these refurbishments should enable a much better experience for the many users of the village hall and also encourage greater use of the facility.A budget of around \u0026pound250,000 has been set aside for the work which has been primarily raised from three sources \u0026mdash the Highland Council, SSE\u0026rsquos energy efficiency fund and Fairburn wind farm fund and the Highland Cross.The spokeswoman added: \u0026ldquoThe Muir of Ord Hall and Facilities Company is very grateful for these contributions and some local donations, without which we would not have been able to proceed.The Muir of Ord Village Hall on Seaforth Road has been a community hub for the village since 1893.

As of last weekend, it was valued at \u0026pound2,013,164,722.61.Addressing colleagues on the audit and scrutiny committee, Cllr MacLean called for a review of investment strategy. She acknowledged the need to secure the best .But she added: \u0026ldquoSome people are not happy with some of the investments and feel that perhaps  it\u0026rsquos invested in tobacco or arms or things like that, it\u0026rsquos not ethically responsible.She asked whether fund trustees had any say in the choice of investments.The council\u0026rsquos investments change on a daily basis.Recent examples of contentious choices include British American Tobacco , liqueurs firm Pernod Ricard , pubs chain Mitchells and Butlers , Japan Tobacco  and China\u0026rsquos second largest brewery, Tsingtao .The council\u0026rsquos finance director Derek Yule explained that an investments sub-committee reports to a pension board which sets the strategy.\u0026ldquoIt is very dficult when some of the investment strategy seeks to invest in shares in companies not just in the UK but worldwide, he said.\u0026ldquoWhilst I totally understand some of the ethical debate, it is very dficult to draw a line sometimes.\u0026ldquoYou might take a view\u0026hellip would you invest in banks, for example? They might not be the best investment, anyway. But I use that as an example because banks will fund these companies.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a dficult balancing act but it\u0026rsquos certainly within your rights  you wished the pension board to look at the investment strategy.\u0026ldquoFund managers are given guidelines to work to, so that would be quite legitimate for the council to do through the pension board.According to current policy, the fund \u0026ldquorecognises that social, environmental and ethical considerations are among factors investment managers will take into account, where relevant, when selecting investments for purchase, retention or sale.However, it stresses that \u0026ldquothe overriding consideration for pension committee members is their fiduciary duty to the scheme employers and scheme members.The Scheme Advisory Board, established up by the Scottish Government to regulate such public sector pension funds, recently obtained advice from legal counsel on the duty of pensions committees.The guidance concluded that: \u0026ldquoPensions committees in Scotland owe a fiduciary duty to the scheme employers and the scheme members in general and specically in relation to investment matters.\u0026ldquoThose duties should be exercised in the best interests of the beneficiaries and in relation to investment decisions, should aim to achieve the best financial position for the fund, balancing risk and  in the usual way.Monday 1 Oct 2018 10:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"        A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.

Duke of Buccleuch may be legally within his rights but sale plans to clear land for forestry are morally flawed, writes Lesley Riddoch.                Is Scotland’s biggest landowner victimising the tenant farmer who accused him of clearing people to make way for trees?            Last week, the Duke of Buccleuch put a portfolio of land on the market called Evertown, which includes farms, productive farmland, commercial forestry and planting opportunities near Canonbie in Dumfries and Galloway. The 9,000 acres is composed of 18 lots on sale for £19.5 million – most hill ground is priced at three times its agricultural value and advertised as “suitable for forestry planting”.            : Video: Who are Scotland’s biggest landowners?It includes Alison and David Telfer’s tenanted farm near the Dumfriesshire village of Langholm, despite earlier promises that the duke would reflect on local anger about removing tenants to secure lucrative forestry planting grants. Local MSP Joan McAlpine has been working behind the scenes on this case and says: “The duke and his factors are unflinchingly cruel in the case of the Telfers. He could easily allow them to see out their working lives at the farm – instead he has split their farm into two lots for sale, removing part of it imminently. The Telfers believe they are being victimised by a powerful and vindictive organisation, and I am inclined to agree.”• : Duke of Buccleuch to sell off thousands of acres of land in BordersThe higher ground of the Telfer’s farm, Cleuchfoot, is being sold for planting under the locally unfamiliar name of “Tansy Hill” combined with a small block of forestry five miles distant. The farmhouse and lower ground are up for sale in a separate lot, though the Telfers have been allowed to stay till next November.            Ms McAlpine said: “Alison and David say breaking up the farm disguises the fact it’s their ground being cleared and sold for tree planting. Cleuchfoot is synonymous with their fight, Tansy Hill means nothing. They think this is deliberate and misleading.”The Telfers say the Buccleuch estate intends to value their sheep for sale on 10 October and will remove the animals soon after. It’s unclear whether Forestry Scotland has approved tree planting. Government ministers have said forestry grants shouldn’t be misused and the duke may know he will be refused permission for mass planting on tenanted farms because of the public outcry when news of terminated leases broke earlier this year.Joan McAlpine said: “Potential purchasers need to be made aware of the situation. The duke could easily allow Alison and David to retire in five years and then sell the land, as promised. It would not hurt His Grace at all. But being forced out is definitely hurting Alison and David.”Of course, the Buccleuch Estate contests this account.            A spokesman refuted the suggestion that the Telfers are being “cleared off their land” as “a complete distortion of the facts” and described Ms McAlpine’s comments as “ inaccurate and inflammatory.” The estate maintains this is not an eviction, but simply the ending of a lease. They say the Telfers have always known of the estate’s long-term plans and the idea they’re being removed for tree planting is “utterly wrong.” They say the Telfers have been given extensions beyond their removal date and the chance to buy the farmhouse and surrounding ground. But how would two people on a frugal income, approaching retirement with no assets find an asking price of £600k? Furthermore, the Telfers have been farming at Cleuchfoot for almost 20 years on a succession of insecure tenancy agreements. Why have these been the only option available? And  the estate has no plan to plant trees, why the urgent need to remove them? Of course Scotland’s Tenant Farming Commissioner, Bob McIntosh, did investigate earlier complaints of bullying and found the duke’s estate acted in compliance with the law.Buccleuch have said the current land sale will honour existing leasing agreements and tenant farmers with secure, long-term tenancies have the chance to buy their farms. It’s believed none have been completed yet though – in part because of restrictive sale conditions.Scottish Land Commission chair Andrew Thin says “We will review the actions Buccleuch now takes with care, and stand ready to offer advice where required.” But he welcomes the move to ersy land ownership. So do farming organisations. So do I.            I’d welcome it a lot more  local farmers were guaranteed a fair chance of becoming future owners. But the question remains.Is it morally acceptable for landowners to get Forestry Commission Scotland grants for planting trees on land where tenant farmers have been cleared and evicted? If not, then the law must change and removals must stop.The practice of shipping people off the land for fracking, tree-planting and wind farms is no more acceptable today than evicting tens of thousands for sheep farming and deer hunting in the Highlands or agricultural and industrial uses in the Lowlands. As Tom Devine’s new book The Scottish Clearances makes graphically clear, eviction and removal of insecure tenants by the landed classes has been a Scotland-wide way of le for centuries. Recent removals of tenant farmers Andrew Stoddart from Haddington and the Paterson family from Arran show that grim way of le continues. It shames Scotland.So who will protect the Telfers?Forestry Commission Scotland  say: “The current forestry grant scheme guidance states applicants must have control of the land and a legal right to plant trees.  We want to be confident that where control has recently changed, or land has come out of farming, any actions taken to end a tenancy or farming partnership by the previous or new owner have been entirely legal.”But these moves are always entirely legal. The question is – are they moral and is the law an ass?FCS may be shamed into declining grant applications from new and existing owners of contested, cleared land.  But that won’t help the Telfers, the campaign to reforest Scotland, the empowerment of local people on quasi-feudal sporting estates or public faith in our land lawsNo new land reform bill is planned for this parliament. Yet we desperately need a way to protect all tenant farmers and ersy large landholdings. Progress is painfully slow and public support for a land tax system is growing.None of this will be formally discussed at the SNP conference. But where does rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing stand? I’m sure the land reform supporting public and the Telfers would love to know.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4807555.1538375591!/image/image.jpg","title":"tories ready to walk away from brexit deal over eu demands","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The UK will walk away from Brexit talks  the EU pushes too hard for concessions on Theresa May\u0026#8217s plans, Dominic Raab is set to warn in the toughest rhetoric towards Brussels yet.                The Brexit Secretary will today tell the Conservative conference in Birmingham that “our willingness to compromise is not without limits”, and warns that “we will be left with no choice but to leave without a deal”  the EU’s position threatens the integrity of the Union.            Yesterday the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, also struck a defiant tone towards Brussels, claiming the UK will not be the only “prisoner” wanting to leave the EU  it is turned into a jail.            Mr Hunt warned EU negotiators to “never ever mistake British politeness for British weakness” and likened their desire to “punish” the UK to the Soviet Union.The tough talk comes after the first day of the Tory conference in Birmingham descended into fresh infighting over Brexit, with senior Conservatives hitting back at Boris Johnson for calling the Prime Minister’s strategy “deranged”. The former foreign secretary crashed through the first day of the Tory conference in Birmingham, saying the Chequers plan was “entirely preposterous” and suggesting that Theresa May wasn’t committed to delivering Brexit.• : Theresa May warned she faces ‘polite rebellion’ over BrexitIt brought a sharp response from Brexiteers and Remainers, with the former Brexit secretary David Davis mocking Mr Johnson’s plans for a bridge linking Britain and Ireland, and Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson calling for a “period of silence”.In an interview with the Sunday Times, Mr Johnson said: “Unlike the Prime Minister, I fought for this, I believe in it, I think it’s the right thing for our country and I think that what is happening now is, alas, not what people were promised in 2016.”            Last night at a pro-Brexit fringe meeting, Scottish Tory MP Ross Thomson called Chequers an “unmitigated disaster that has humiliated us at home and in the EU, and is breaking this party apart”. The isions will continue today with a fringe meeting attended by two former ministers calling for a second EU referendum on the terms of the UK’s Brexit deal.Mrs May insisted she was acting in “the national interest” by pushing ahead with a plan to keep the UK aligned with the EU in trade of goods, in a bid to maintain the status quo along the Irish border and limit the damage to the economy.The Prime Minister told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme: “I do believe in Brexit. Crucially, I believe in delivering Brexit in a way that respects the vote and delivers on the vote of the British people while also protecting our union, protecting jobs and ensuring we make a success of Brexit for the future.”She said the onus was on the EU to come forward with detailed explanations of its concerns, along with counter-proposals for discussion. “Chequers at the moment is the only plan on the table that delivers on the Brexit vote and also delivers for the people of Northern Ireland,” the Prime Minister told Marr.            “Where they have problems, let’s actually hear them and it’s only then that you can actually identy what the issue really is, where there are issues that lie behind this.“My mood is to listen to what the EU have to say about their concerns and to sit down and talk them through with them.”Ms Davidson questioned why the former foreign secretary was against a plan for the Irish border that was signed off by the full cabinet in December.“There’s been time over the last two years for debate,” she told the BBC’s Sunday Politics Scotland programme.“The former foreign secretary was in one of the great offices of state during the time that much of this plan was being constructed – and praised it as soon ago as last year.            “In terms of a period of silence, I would be very welcoming of one.”Addressing the conference today, Ms Davidson will appeal for unity and call for party members to “go back to our Conservative principles” and reject Brexit dogma.“We can agree a Brexit deal under the Conservatives, or we can risk handing the keys of Downing Street to Jeremy Corbyn,” Ms Davidson will say. “I know which one I believe is in the national interest. I stand by the Prime Minister.”In his speech in Birmingham, Mr Raab will describe his approach to Brexit as “pragmatic, not dogmatic”.“Our proposals would deliver a historic agreement that provides a roadmap out of the EU and a final deal that will be good for the whole country.“But our willingness to compromise is not without limits. We are leaving the European Union in fact, not just in name. If we can’t obtain a deal that secures that objective…  an attempt is made to lock us in via the back door of the EEA and customs union… or  the only offer from the EU threatens the integrity of our Union. Then we will be left with no choice but to leave without a deal.”Former Brexit secretary Mr Davis, who quit Mrs May’s Cabinet along with Mr Johnson in protest at the Chequers plan, was dismissive of a series of policy suggestions from the pretender to the Tory leadership. “I think one of the blights of British politics is politicians having fantastic ideas that cost a fortune and don’t do much good,” Mr Davis told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday.“Quite a lot of his ideas, I think, are good headlines but not necessarily good policies.”Mr Davis confirmed he would vote against Chequers  it came before the House of Commons in its current form, but rejected Labour suggestions that defeat for Mrs May at the hands of Tory rebels would collapse the Government.“I will vote against Chequers, full stop, and it won’t lead to a general election,” he said.“We are capable of managing this through.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do.

A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in 2018, having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.\nAfter a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on 29 minutes, and never looked back.\nEvan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from 20 yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.\nGreg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.\nNewtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.\nThe second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the 90 minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.\nSeconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.\nWhen Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.\nNewtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of 48, was his first final.\nMacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.\nHe said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.\n“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”\nLovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.\n“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up.

Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!\n“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”\nCherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.\nHaving battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”\nDespite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of Lucky2Bhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like Lucky2Bhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be here  it wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”\n\nThree days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday 12th June, 52-year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.\n“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took 40 to 50 minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”\nAfter being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.\nHaving served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”\nDuring his 13 years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”\n\n\nOn Wednesday 13th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, 76-year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.\n“John hadn’t been 100 per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was 75 — to take it easy, so we came home\u0026#8230 We went to bed about 11 o’clock.”\n“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”\nCarol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled 999 and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.\n“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about 10 years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”\nJohn was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.\n“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”\nCarol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.\n“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”\nDr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by Lucky2Bhere is “truly le-saving”.\n“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every 90 seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by 10 per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.\n\u0026#8220The approach taken by Lucky2Bhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”\nEstablished in 2007, Lucky2Bhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in 2006 but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.\nIn view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – Lucky2Bhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across the  and breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.\nLast year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all 24 primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently 115 public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than 50 across Skye.\nRoss Cowie said: “We always said at Lucky2Bhere that  we could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.\n“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills.

Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.\nIn stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before \u0026#8211 which saw him earn a red card \u0026#8211 Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.\n\nThe south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.\nKyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a platform to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.\n\nWith Mallaig having finished the season on 39 points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher\u0026#8217s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.\nWhat followed was a fine team performance by the 2017 winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson \u0026#8211 including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half.\n\n\n \u0026#8220I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.\u0026#8221\n\u0026#8220The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have only  one defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.\u0026#8221\nI don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig \u0026#8211 so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We\u0026#8217re still learning and hopefully improving.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people\u0026#8217s expectations of you.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.\u0026#8221\n \u0026#8220No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.\u0026#8221\n\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212-\n\n\nArticle by Adam Gordon\nAll images by Willie Urquhart.\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead Ennis\nThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday 11th, September. \nThousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. \n“Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. \n“The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.\nHer government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.\nShe had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.\nBut despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.\nInstead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.\nFaced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.\nIt also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls?\nAnd while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.\nThe aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time.

realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.\nThiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.\nTheopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €60. \nLike Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. \nIf the film ‘Black 47’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the 1790s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In 1861 the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘Kilkenny  Moderator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:\n“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” \nThe recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.\nStudents of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. \nThe book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of 1,000 rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties 1865-92’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. \nThis is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview \n Ruairí Doyle\n\n“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TD\nSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. \nHe also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. \nSpeaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.\nThe Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the 1980’s. \nThis informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, even  it were 40 or 50 years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.\nPearse, who has been a TD since 2010, talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. \nThe Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. \nHe said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,  I am in thatposition.”\nSinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.\nPearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. \nThis is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”\nHe continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €2.5 billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”\nAs Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.\nDeputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  \n“What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  \n“It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”\nTouching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the 26 Counties.\nPearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. \nHe continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  \n“And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”\nSinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. \nThis Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. \nTeachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athome  that’s what they wish.” \n\n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8650567.1538134353!/image/image.jpg","title":"happiest places in northern ireland revealed and the most miserable","story":"                \nScores were produced for council area by the Office of National Statistics  based on four measures of personal well-being - le satisfaction, feeling that the things done in le are worthwhile, happiness and anxiety.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHealth, employment and relationship status are key determinants of personal well-being according to previous research done by the ONS.

McWilliam Gallery \u0026amp Studio\u0027s 10th anniversary are  Millie Moore , Dr Riann Coulter  and Roger Wilson .\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“McWilliam’s work remains the key attraction within our artistic programme and we complement our outstanding collection of his work with at least four major modern and contemporary exhibitions every year.”\n\nOver a decade, the gallery has hosted hugely popular exhibitions from some of Europe’s most celebrated artists including William Scott, Basil Blackshaw, Rita Duffy, Margaret Clarke, Susan MacWilliam and, recently, Neil Shawcross. Local groups including Banbridge Camera Club, Banbridge Art Club and local schools and colleges have also had the opportunity to exhibit at the gallery, ensuring its popularity with local visitors and supporters.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThere also big plans ahead, with a major exhibition of Scottish art from the Fleming Wyfold Collection scheduled for summer 2019. An exciting collaboration with the British Museum is already under way too, in addition to plans for a unique exhibition of award-winning works from the internationally celebrated local contemporary painter Colin Davidson.\n\nLord Mayor of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Cllr Julie Flaherty, said: “With a stunning sculpture garden and an authentic recreation of McWilliam’s studio, we’re delighted and proud to celebrate a decade of work, commitment and success and look forward to the many more great things ahead. We’d like to thank everyone for their patronage and loyalty to the gallery and look forward to seeing faces old and new in this celebratory year.”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nPresent and past serving staff at the F.E. McWilliam Gallery \u0026amp Studio at the 10th anniversary celebrations.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nOne of the gallery’s closest collaborations has been with its cross-border partner, Highlanes Gallery, Drogheda. Jointly funded through East Border Region Interreg funding, the two galleries have both become established as leading visual arts venues and are currently working on a new, joint exhibition for November 2018 which features work by top international artists from the Arts Council Collection, London and National Museums Northern Ireland.\n\nF.E. McWilliam Gallery and Studio also incorporates an award-winning restaurant – Quails Café – which adds huge weight to its appeal as a major cultural and hospitality destination which can be shared with family, friends and colleagues.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTo celebrate its 10th year, the F.E. McWilliam Studio and Gallery is presenting two very special exhibitions, both of which run until November 10.\n\nLucienne Day: Living Design Celebrating the le and work of one of most influential designers of the post-war generation, Lucienne Day, and tells the story of her thrilling design career, unfolding in a sequence of photographs drawn from the archives of the Robin and Lucienne Day Foundation. Curated by Professor Emma Hunt, Arts University Bournemouth and Day’s daughter Paula Day, the critically-acclaimed exhibition has attracted thousands of visitors from across the UK, featuring in Elle Decoration and the  Magazine.\n\nOpen 18 Sculpture: Showcasing the stunning 30 outdoor sculptural works by acclaimed contemporary artists including Sandra Bell, Orla de Bri, Paddy Campbell, Drydan Wilson, Helen Hanse and Anthony Scott. The gallery’s award-winning sculpture garden provides the perfect setting for these stunning works in bronze, stone, steel and glass.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8650969.1538146408!/image/image.jpg","title":"hall hay lujah a new church is born in co down","story":"\nA spectacular structure made by a team of volunteers from a Co Down church has been attracting visitors far and wide.\n\n                \nThe church made of hay was constructed by First Rathfriland Presbyterian Church by way of an invitation to its upcoming harvest service ... though hay-fever sufferers can rest easy as the structure is for promotional purposes only.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nThe church made from hay to promote Rathfriland Presbyterian Church\u0027s Harvest service\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt was the church’s minister, Rev Trevor Boyd, who first introduced hay sculptures in conjunction with First Rathfriland’s annual harvest service: “We’ve been doing a harvest build for four years – we’ve had teddy bears, cows, this year we’ve went for a church.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Historically, and still currently, harvest is one of those occasions when people tend to go to church. People will go as a community to worship, they’ll move about each others churches. We thought this year we’d put the church back in the centre of it.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nOf the newly built church, he said: “It’s a bit of a step up from a teddy bear but we have a willing band of workers, so fair play to them for putting this together. \n\n“There was probably about a dozen people of all ages working on it. It took them a day and half to put it on site but they been working at it before that, preparing the windows and things like that.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nMinister of Rathfriland Presbyterian Church Rev Trevor Boyd\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“You’ve got people involved in the painting, there’s farmers involved with their telehandlers, supplying the straw and putting it into place.\n\n“It’s a relevant way to connect with people, to get their interest and to highlight to them that it’s harvest time and that there’s an opportunity to thank God for the harvest in First Rathfriland.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nOf the structure, which is located around half a mile from the church, Rev Boyd said: “There’s been quite a draw to it, as in other years. People come to it to have their photos taken. People look forward to seeing what’s going to be on the site.\n\n“This year with Storm Ali it was a wee bit later. People thought maybe nothing was going up this year, but we didn’t want to put it up and lose it in the storm, so we waited.”\n\nThe Harvest Thanksgiving services take place on Sunday, October 7 at 11.30am and 7pm.\n\nRev Boyd added: “Our church building will also be open from 3pm to 6pm for the whole community to look at the displays, listen to live music and enjoy some apple tart.”\n\n

Written by Stephen Large and directed by the multi-talented Martin Lynch, Three’s A Shroud examines the funny side of Belfast’s undertaking business and transforms the not so funny subject of death and religious rivalry into a barrel of laughs.\nFor years, veteran undertaker Gerry McSorley  has buried only Catholics. “They bury theirs, we bury ours,” he says simply.\nMcSorley’s assistant is Poleglass lad Simon Doherty . Simon is a wannabe rapper who’s in the wrong job, because quite simply he’s disgusted at the very thought of preparing dead bodies for a funeral. The relationship between the two is fascinating and hilarious at the same time.\nAs the battle for business intensies, Simon comes up with new and inventive ways of bringing Gerry’s business into the 21st century through the use of Facebook, an app to allow clients to track their loved ones from the morgue and live-streaming funeral services. His ideas and imagination are endless.\nFuneral traditions go out the window when young Protestant undertaker Basil Gray , who is more interested in courting widowed customers, comes along after taking over his late father’s business.\nA special mention to Shaun for his acting out of famous movie scenes from ‘The Godfather’ to ‘Scarface’ whilst preparing bodies – it’s genius, and perhaps worth a play in itself.\nBasil decides to break traditions, sparking a tit-for-tat rivalry between him and McSorley. It’s at this point Gerry turns to the Belfast  and News Letter for some Protestant customers.\nA hilarious mix-up of ‘Here Lies A Soldier’ and the ‘Soldier’s Song’ at McSorley’s first attempt at a Protestant funeral spells the end of that.\nThe undertaking war then takes an unexpected twist as the rivals are caught cold by the introduction of a half-price, new-age, interdenominational funeral service, managed by young Polish woman Irena Bukowski .\n“Typical,” says Gerry McSorley, “coming over here taking our dead bodies” in one of many unforgettable lines in the comedy.\nIrena’s new funeral service proves hugely popular in an age of austerity, forcing the Catholic and Protestant undertakers to put their rivalry aside to attempt to win back their customers,  abandoning the usuns against themuns’ policy.\nAfter a high profile republican and loyalist  are killed, the three rival undertakers are forced together as one in a desperate bid to avoid the paramilitaries and, yes, death. Disaster surely beckons, or can they work together and dodge a bullet? I will say no more.\nThree’s a Shroud is full of classic lewd, crude, rude and standard yet classic ‘Norn Iron’ humour that is expertly delivered by the impressive cast.\nThe play sees the actors skilfully play multiple roles, with a special mention for McGowan, who doubles up as Gerry’s cleaner, known for her hilariously foul-mouthed banter.\nSpike, the UVF’s ‘community donations collector,  and Gusty Stitt’s son are wonderfully played also.\nThree’s A Shroud reminds us of three things: we love to be offended, le is short and we are better united than ided.\nThe play is tribute to the rise of writer Stephen Large, who has shot to fame after creating the very funny Dundonald Liberation Army  page on Facebook, gaining 30,000 followers in no time.\nAs for GBL Productions and Martin Lynch, what more can you say in praise and admiration of one of the north’s most successful playwrights?\nI can’t recommend this hilarious comedy enough.\n\n\nThree’s A Shroud is at the Waterfront Hall until October 6. Tickets are available by calling 028 9033 4455, online at www.waterfront and at the Box Office at the Ulster Hall.\n\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"time for truth campaign travel to stormont","story":"\nTHE Time for Truth campaign travelled to Stormont yesterday and submitted 6000 responses to the NIO’s consultation, Addressing the Legacy of the Past in the North, during a meeting with NIO Deputy Director Chris Flatt.\n\nMr Flatt is overseeing the legacy consultation. The campaign also took the opportunity to highlight their campaign objectives: raising awareness of the Time for Truth advice clinics across Belfast on Saturday, September 29 and working to see  institutions for dealing with the past up and running.\n\nCampaign spokesman Ciarán MacAirt said: “We were very grateful for the time that the Deputy Director of the NIO took to listen to the families of the Time for Truth campaign. After handing over 6000 responses to the legacy consultation, we discussed how we supported the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement in full and the proper resourcing of the coronial inquest system and Office of Police Ombudsman.”\n\n“We also told Mr Flatt that we planned to gather even more responses before the close of the consultation on 5th of October, especially during the advice clinics we are running across Belfast on Saturday to support any citizens who wish to respond.\n\n“We were also keen to discuss how long after the consultation closes that our families will see the British state’s response to the consultation, its passing of appropriate legislation at Westminster, and the structures in place and working. Although we want to ensure that the work is done properly, unlike it was in the past, families have longer to wait for any prospect of truth and justice under the proposed mechanisms, so the proper resourcing of the legacy inquests and the Office of the Police Ombudsman could help begin the process now. Any other delay will see the families of the Time for Truth campaign take to the streets as we did in February of this year when 7000 victims and survivors, friends and supporters joined our March for Truth.” \n"},{"url":null,"title":"a long drive home for armagh familys","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

He\u0027s always tinkered and restored cars and I wanted to help him. I guess this was my apprenticeship,\" said the 26-year-old nurse from Middletown.\n\nMandy and her dad spent weekend after weekend lovingly restoring the car over the past four years.\n\n\"We just started it as a weekend project. We both work full-time, so it was a hobby for both of us,\" she said.\n\n\"My dad has always tinkered with cars but we took on quite a lot with this one. However, looking at it now, there\u0027s no way I\u0027d ever part with it. It has a lot of sentimental value.\"\n\nThe Cortina caused quite a stir as Mandy, husband Justin Gormley, Robert and mum Jessica made their way through the Continent on the 3,350-mile road trip. \n\nThe family spent a lot of their spare time posing for photographs. \n\nThe Cortina was even commandeered for a photoshoot by a model agency in Paris.\n\n\"The whole experience made us feel pretty cool,\" added Mandy.\n\n\"Once the Cortina got through the MoT in June we decided we\u0027d go for it. We turned it into our family holiday, though we had to load the boot up with a lot of spare parts just in case, as we weren\u0027t really sure  our work on the car would last the pace.\n\n\"We thought about driving straight to Cortina and back again, but it was too good an opportunity to waste, so we planned the trip to take in a lot of the sights all of us wanted to see around Europe. It all went so well and we might plan another one.\"\n\nApart from the UK, the car passed through the Republic, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Italy, Austria, Slovenia and Monaco.\n\n\"We\u0027ve been through the Black Forest, driven across the Millau Viaduct in southern France, the highest bridge in the world, and around the famous Stelvio Pass in the north of Italy with its 49 hairpin bends,\" said Mandy.\n\n\"When we arrived in Cortina D\u0027Ampezzo in Italy the locals were amazed to see the car. \n\n\"There are not that many of them still around, and even fewer managed to make it back to the town they were named after.\"\n\nBack in 1964 a new Ford Cortina would have completed around 32 miles to the gallon, but Mandy said she wanted to make the car as economical as possible.\n\n\"You could say I had a trip like this in the back of my mind when we put a diesel engine in it, and in the end we were getting up to 62mpg, so that was well worth it considering how far we\u0027ve managed to travel in it.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"government agrees to special vote over directly elected city mayors","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The crucial infrastructural issues in the capital relating to traffic, housing and planning need to be coordinated rather than fragmented.\n\n“It is clear that the Government has dropped the ball and fudged the issue by referring it to the Citizens’ Assembly next year.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"wait wait he screamed ryanair passenger tackled to ground making late dash across tarmac at dublin airport","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

recovered from a “solid contraction” in August.\n\nCompanies reported higher sales to the likes of the US, Europe, Canada, Scandinavia, and Russia.\n\nEmployment also increased, with jobs growth at small and medium-sized businesses offsetting further cuts at large-scale firms.\n\nHowever, input costs rose at their quickest pace since June, due to higher price tag across electronic components, energy, food products, metals, paper, plastics, resins and timber.\n\n\n\nMany UK manufacturers also noted that the backdrop of Brexit and a volatile exchange rate were making any forecasting activity increasingly dficult, with uncertainty adding to reluctance to hire.\nRob Dobson, IHS Markit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nThe foreign exchange rate also played a part in higher costs, alongside supply shortages and global inflationary pressures.\n\nRob Dobson, director at IHS Markit which compiles the survey, said: “September saw a mild improvement in the performance of the UK manufacturing sector.\n\n“Domestic market demand strengthened, while increased orders from North America and Europe helped new export business stage a modest recovery from August’s contraction.\n\n“Business confidence also rose to a three-month high.”\n\nThe survey showed that more than 53% of companies expect production to increase over the next 12 months.\n\n“Despite these causes for short-term optimism, conditions in manufacturing are still relatively lacklustre overall,” Mr Dobson said.\n\n“Many UK manufacturers also noted that the backdrop of Brexit and a volatile exchange rate were making any forecasting activity increasingly dficult, with uncertainty adding to reluctance to hire.”\n\nHoward Archer, chief economic adviser at the EY Item Club, said there are “limited grounds for optimism”.\n\n“While offering some encouragement, the manufacturing sector looks to be finding it hard to regain traction after a markedly weakened performance over the first half of the year.\n\n“The manufacturing’s performance so far in 2018 has largely been in stark contrast to the robust performance seen through the second half of 2017.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"9 of the

in the city after a woman who collapsed at a Derry cinema was forced to wait two hours for an ambulance to arrive.\n\nThe incident happened at the Brunswick Moviebowl in the Pennyburn Industrial Estate on Saturday, September 21.\n\nEamonn McLaughlin, Manager of the cinema at Brunswick Moviebowl in Pennyburn, said that an ambulance took a full two hours after a female customer became ill and collapsed before 4pm. \n\nIt was almost 6pm before an ambulance arrived.\n\nSpeaking to the Derry News, said that when they contacted the emergency services, the operator said they were ‘inundated’.\n\nIt was brought to our attention that a customer was feeling unwell.\n\n“We always have quite a few first aiders on site so the lady was assessed and we decided we needed to ring for an ambulance while the customer was left in a comfortable position with a blanket and pillow.\n“The ambulance was first called at 3.45pm and didn’t arrive until 5.45pm. \n\n“We rang again at about 4.20pm and we were told that they were inundated with calls and they couldn’t tell us how much longer it would take, but that  there were any further concerns to ring back.\n\n“At about 5pm we were quite concerned because she was getting very weak and we wanted to know  we should try to have her gently lted into a car to get her to hospital.”\n\nMr McLaughlin said that after contacting the operator again, they were told that the ambulance was coming from Strabane.\n\n“We wanted to know what the best thing to do was so we rang again at about 5pm and were told that an ambulance was on its way but that it was making its way from Strabane so was still quite a way off,” he added.\n\n“I had discussed it with the telephone operator and with the family and we decided to make the customer comfortable as we didn’t want to move her.”\n\nMr McLaughlin said that he understood that the serious delay was down to the fact the ambulance service was ‘inundated’ with calls and didn’t have the resources to cope.\n\nHowever, he said he was happy that the woman was recovering well and that it had not been more serious.\n“Thankfully, she is doing well,” he said.\n\n“But  it had been more serious, it could have been a very dferent story.”\n\n\nDeteriorating position \n\n\nA spokesperson Northern Ireland Ambulance Service  confirmed that they received a call at 3.46pm last Saturday and, based on the information given, ‘the call was determined to be Category C, neither serious, nor immediately le-threatening’.\n\nThe spokesperson said that the call was referred to the Clinical Support Desk  Paramedic based in the Emergency Control Room, which ed a call at around 4.15pm to establish further details and advice was given  the patient’s condition deteriorated to call 999 again.\n\n“An ambulance had already been despatched by 5.04pm when a further 999 call was made at 5.16pm relating the deterioration of the patient’s condition and the call was upgraded to Category A, potentially serious or le-threatening,” the spokesperson added.\n\n“The ambulance then arrived at the scene at 5.44pm and the patient was assessed, treated and discharged at the scene.”\n\n\n\n

years, there has been an increase in demand for ambulances with calls going up by almost 50 per cent.\n\n“NIAS would like to apologise for any discomfort and distress caused to the patient during her wait for the arrival of an ambulance,” the spokesperson added.\n\n“There has been an increase in ambulance response times over recent years and the main reason for this is the year on year increase in demand for our service.”\n\n“The number of calls to the Ambulance Service has increased from 150,093 in 2012/13, to 220,090 in 2017/18, an increase of 46 per cent.”\n\nThe NIAS spokesperson said that there has been a system in place to respond to the most serious cases first and urged the public to engage in a public consultation on the new model, was launched on Thursday.\n\n“In order to address this deteriorating position, NIAS has undertaken a detailed demand and capacity analysis which has established the level of additional capacity required to meet demand within the target timescales, and is developing proposals for a new clinical response model to provide the most urgent response to the most clinically urgent patients,” she said.\n\n“This proposed new model is based on similar models introduced elsewhere in the UK which have proved effective and indicate improved patient outcomes. \n\n“A public consultation on this proposed new model will be launched today and will be available on our website \nwww.nias.hscni.net\n. \n\n“NIAS would encourage all stakeholders to engage during the consultation process.”\n\n\nHeroes\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Foyle MLA and SDLP Health spokesperson Mark H Durkan, said that he had spoken to the Chair of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service with regard to shortages in the emergency service.\n\n“I recently met with the newly appointed Chair of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, Nicole Lappin, to highlight my concerns about the shortage and lack of cover in the North West area, which she accepted the merit of,” he said.\n\n“She outlined her desire to transform the service and make it fit for purpose. \n\n“The problems aren’t to do with the state of the fleet it is actually the shortage of human resources available.” \n\nHe added: “There are just not enough people in the job and I do not think the people doing the job have adequate support.\n\n“In fact, it is usually people who work on ambulances who share their concerns with me about the state of affairs that prevents them from doing their job and getting to people on time.\n\n“This is no reflection on the staff, they are absolute heroes but at times they are covering distances from Limavady to Omagh, leaving only one ambulance in this area.”\n\n\nPictured above: Brunswick Moviebowl where a woman who collapsed last Saturday had to wait two

In Downpatrick, 335 are on the waiting list, with 227 in urgent need.\n\nLast year, a total of 95 social homes were allocated in both towns, with the Executive confirming work is currently underway to build 30 new homes in Newcastle and 37 in Downpatrick as part of the first phase of the redevelopment of the former Downe Hospital site.\n\nThe waiting list figures were outlined at Monday night\u0026rsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, with politicians saying they are acutely aware of the pressure on housing officials to meet increasing need.\n\nThey say they are willing to do all they can to help and hope land can be secured to build more social homes to help reduce waiting list numbers.

Castlewellan councillor Mrs Ethel Smyth has labelled the behaviour of Lord Melchett as \u0026ldquodisgraceful and called for immediate action.\n\nThe furore centres around a five year-old girl whose father wants her to attend a state controlled school in Dundrum or Castlewellan. However, because she lives in the country outside Castlewellan she would need to have school minibus transport provided for her.\n\nAccording to Mrs Smyth, she has been told by the South Eastern Education and Library Board that the child will have to go to a maintained school in Annsborough which would exclude the need for transport arrangements.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe child\u0026rsquos father wants her to go to a controlled school and he is entitled to have her do so, Mrs Smyth said. \u0026ldquoI am thoroughly disgusted and I think that the Department of Education must be totally inefficient  they don\u0026rsquot answer within a month.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash There just seems to be no stopping the Downpatrick supergroup Rosetta Stone, who recently completed another dynamic tour of Japan and will be setting off on a trip to Thailand later this year.\n\nThe five members of the group \u0026mdash Damien, Terry and Colin McKee, Andy LeGear and Ian Mitchell \u0026mdash are just back from their second conquering trip to Japan where their latest hit, Sheila, is currently number one.\n\nIn the last year the band have been playing constantly across the globe and have built up a huge following in many countries, including Germany and Canada. But it has been in Japan that Rosetta Stone have really shot to stardom.\n\nThis was one of the first countries which the band visited after its formation and it became clear from the start that the young Irish lads obviously had something which appealed to Japanese girls.\n\nAt the end of their first Japanese tour each member of the group received a gold disc for mass sales of their LP, Rock Pictures, and their first two singles also thundering into the Japanese charts.\n\nNow they have gone and taken Japan by storm again where they are playing to crowds of between 11,000 and 15,000 twice a day.\n\nKILCLIEF \u0026mdash Strangford police have appealed to the public to help them trace keys which were stolen from a car on Saturday.\n\nThe car, a Chrysler Hillman Minx, had been parked in a field at Kilclief between 1.30 and 2pm while\u0026nbsp Mr John McMullan, of Drumroe Road, was working. When he arrived back at the vehicle an ignition key and a boot key had ben taken.\n\nPolice in Strangford have since been informed that a children\u0026rsquos sponsored walk was passing through the area at the time and they have appealed to parents to ask the children who took part  they know anything about the theft.\n\nNEWCASTLE \u0026mdash A burning interest in art has led Newcastle couple Margaret and Gerry Grant into an unusual project \u0026mdash the opening of a new art gallery in their own home.\n\nWith over 200 paintings and sculptures of their own they have opened the gallery in an extension to their Bryansford Road house.\n\nBut it isn\u0026rsquot only for the fun of it. The Grants will be buying and selling works and promoting exhibitions. Already they have lined up an autumn show with exhibits from a Spanish painter and an Italian sculptor.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are aiming at the professional rather than the amateur, Mrs Grant said. \u0026ldquoOur main aim is to share our interest in art, but we do see the commercial and promotional sides to it.\n\n\u0026ldquoReally there is a wide range of work on show. My husband and I have been interested in art for a long time.\n\nDUNDRUM \u0026mdash A phantom clothes line thief has struck again \u0026mdash this time in Dundrum. The thief, who has been confining his acts to the Newcastle and Dundrum area, struck during the night at a house on the Dromara Road.\n\nA considerable number of children\u0026rsquos clothes were taken from the line, making it a profitable night for the thief.\n\nPolice in Dundrum and Newcastle are anxious to catch the thief, who must have a considerable wardrobe stocked up by now. Anyone with information or who sees anyone acting suspiciously around houses at night should contact them immediately.\n\nKILLINCHY \u0026mdash Plans for a new primary school in Killinchy have brought a \u0026rsquono go\u0026rsquo sign from local residents. In a petition to the South Eastern Education and Library Board, the residents of Ardview Park have expressed serious concern about the plans.\n\nIt\u0026rsquos not the building of the school they object to, but rather the fact that access to the site will be off Ardview Park. They say they are concerned about traffic which will be using the road, both during the construction of the school and when it is opened.\n\nTheir petition was recently shown to members of the Board\u0026rsquos Finance Committee. Afterwards it was agreed to set up a special sub-committee to visit the school and report back on the plans.\n\nBALLYGOWAN \u0026mdash A Ballygowan housewe will be one of eight ladies who will be taking part in the national finals of the Cook of the Realm contest.

The top prize is valued at more than \u0026pound4,000.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash Ardglass boxer Ray Ross has been offered a wonderful chance to make an impact on the British lightweight scene.\n\nEvery since he lost a close decision to Charlie Nash for the Irish title two years ago, the 28 year-old slugger has shown indferent form. But now the Ardglass golf course greenskeeper has a chance to make the top before he runs out of fight time and interest.\n\nRoss has been matched with the experienced Jonnie Elliott, of Bournemouth, over eight rounds at Maysfield Leisure Centre in Belfast on October 11 and a win would hoist Ross up the lightweight ladder and on to bigger punch for paydays.\n\nRay is part of a big British title fight night involving Antrim southpaw Jim Montague against Clinton McKenzie for the vacant light welterweight title.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Kilclief in full flow as ‘Fin are bottled up  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA RESILIENT Kilclief outfit produced a rousing second half display to shatter Aughlisnafin\u0026rsquos championship dreams at St Colman\u0026rsquos Park, Drumaness, on Saturday.\n\nDespite going into the break only 0-6 to 0-4 down, Kilclief were staring down the barrel of an ignoble defeat after losing the influential Louis McMullan and James McGrath to early black cards.\n\nTo make matters even worse, they also lost the talismanic Ciaran Sloan to a hamstring injury and almost down to the bare bones, they looked vulnerable and there for the taking.\n\nHowever, led brilliantly by Aiden McCann and Eoin King they took the game to Aughlisnafin with a swagger and sparkle that Willie Megoran\u0026rsquos side were unable to contain.\n\nAughlisnafin were impressively out of the traps first.

The all-weather leboat under coxswain William Chambers launched within minutes into the middle of Storm Ali as it unleashed its devastating power.\n\nThe challenging weather conditions the crew was going to face en route to Newtownards were immediately apparent after launch, with the coxswain requesting the closure of main water tight doors as the vessel was battered by eight metre high waves.\n\nA Force 8 gale was blowing as the crew approached Strangford Lough some 90 minutes after the seas started to settle as the leboat was sheltered by the shore.\n\nOn arrival at the yacht club, the Coastguard was concerned that there may be a person on board the weather beaten vessel, but it was subsequently confirmed there wasn\u0026rsquot.\n\nThe leboat was then requested to go the aid of another yacht drting across the lough from Whiterock and Kircubbin. Unfortunately, by the time the leboat reached the vessel there was nothing the crew could do as it was on the rocks on an ebbing tide.\n\nAs the leboat made her  journey to Newcastle and was approaching Portaferry, the crew were alerted to another yacht in dficulty. The crew established a tow line and managed to free the vessel and towed it to the safety off a mooring in Strangford marina.\n\nThe  to Newcastle was another hazardous journey as the crew battled mountainous seas, forcing the vessel to stop at Ardglass marina for an hour to allow the storm force wind to ease and the waves to decrease. The leboat left the marina at 6pm, ing home one hour later.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis was a challenging day for our volunteers given that we launched into rough seas when Storm Ali was at its worst, said Coxswain William Chambers when safely back ashore. \u0026ldquoOur volunteers are highly skilled and trained for these situations and were delighted to be able to help.\n\nSome of the largest trees to fall victim to last weekend\u0026rsquos storm have been a prominent landmark in Castlewellan\u0026rsquos Lower Square for generations.\n\nSlieve Croob councillor Ro\u0026iacutes\u0026iacuten Howell believes the location of the fallen trees should be the future home of the town\u0026rsquos permanent Christmas tree.\n\n\u0026ldquoLike many other residents who have grown up in the area their whole le, I was saddened to see these two great trees blow down.

The local council was recently represented at the eighth international conference on UNESCO global geoparks in Italy.\u0026nbsp\n\nSenior UNESCO officials, scientists, policy makers, government representatives and local communities from across the globe gathered at the Adamello Brento geopark to discuss sustainable development and the activities of the global geopark network.\u0026nbsp\n\nDuring the event, Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland  presented an abstract on the proposed geopark in the Mournes area.\n\nLocal authority chairman, Mark Murnin, said the conference provided an excellent platform to share the story of the aspiring Two Oceans Geopark proposal for the local area to an international audience.\n\nIn addition, he said the event provided a chance to highlight the rich geology of the region as well as the benefits geopark status will provide to the area through geotourism.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis was an excellent occasion which allowed us to network and exchange innovative and best practice approaches with geoparks around the world, Cllr Murnin added.\n\nSince March last year, the local authority\u0026rsquos aspiring geopark project team, in partnership with GSNI, has undertaken delivery of an intensive communications plan to spell out the proposal, while over the coming months there will be a programme of educational activities held across the council area.\u0026nbsp\n\nGeoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.\n\nSecuring the prestigious designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos tourism strategy.\n\nThe current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the UNESCO designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.\n\nThe local authority is exploring the tourism potential associated with securing geopark status, with officials insisting there is a signicant financial benefit for securing it, with the benefits not just economic.\u0026nbsp\n\nOfficials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the area\u0026rsquos signicant geological and other heritage.\n\nThere are currently 127 geoparks found in 35 countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.\n\nHowever, the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.\u0026nbsp\n\nFurther information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/8724877.jpg","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"\n\n  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper \nStratton\n  \n    THE.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. It\u0026rsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.\u0026nbsp\n  If Translink brought back open  tickets, I\u0026rsquom sure we\u0026rsquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesn\u0026rsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

for a mistake made by a reporter while discussing an upcoming documentary about the civil rights movement.\n\n                \nDUP MP Gregory Campbell had written to the broadcaster on behalf of a constituent who had made a complaint regarding comments made by reporter Lynette Fay on the Good Morning Ulster Show in August. \n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nEast Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe remarks related to a documentary she was presenting about the 50th anniversary of the civil rights march in Dungannon in August 1968, as part of BBC Radio Ulster’s Stories in Sound series.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Campbell said: “During the interview, the reporter was asked about the impact of the march. She said it ‘provided a focus to provide better jobs, better housing and one man one vote – adding that these things didn’t exist back in 1968 for the nationalist community’. \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“The constituent complained that Ms Fay as a BBC reporter had inferred that nationalists didn’t have a vote, which was totally incorrect.” \n\nIn correspondence to the East Londonderry MP, the BBC’s head of corporate and community affairs, Mark Adair said it regretted the “omission”, adding: “We accept that actual franchise arrangements were not as described and that it would have been helpful for these to have been explained in terms of the rate-based voting system that was in place in 1968 and its effect on people from dferent community backgrounds. \n\n“We think that all of this was properly reflected within the documentary itself, but regret this omission and upset caused.”    \n\nMr Adair said the team involved “work hard to avoid mistakes and are committed to learning from them”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn response, Mr Campbell said: “The issue that arises from this admission is precisely that the BBC have NOT learnt from their numerous errors, misjudgments, bias and ‘mistakes’.  \n\n“It is important that listeners and viewers of BBC programmes make official complaints to the BBC no matter how numerous they may be. \n\n“As a public organisation the BBC needs to be independent, transparent and accountable to its licence payers.”\n\n

deal to the Government amid hopes of securing the green light in this month\u0026#8217s Budget.\n\n                \nThe city and surrounding council areas want Chancellor Philip Hammond to give the go-ahead for a bespoke investment deal similar to those secured by other urban centres around the UK.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBelfast and five other councils on the eastern side of Northern Ireland have joined forces with universities and higher education institutions to pitch for a city deal they believe can deliver 20,000 jobs through a 10-year investment strategy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe partner organisations hope that £1 billion of public funds can leverage a further £3 billion of investment from the private sector.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThey are asking Mr Hammond to stump up £450 million.\n\nThe terms of the proposed deal would see that sum match-funded from Stormont’s coffers – when elected ministers  – with the six councils contributing £100,000 and the universities poised to add further investment.\n\nThe six councils that have partnered together are Antrim and Newtownabbey Ards and North Down Belfast Lisburn and Castlereagh Mid and East Antrim and Newry, Mourne and Down.\n\nThe bid team hope Mr Hammond will sign off on the general outline of the deal in the October 29 Budget, locking in a firm Treasury funding pledge, paving the way for further work on the inidual elements of the strategy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe envisaged deal, which has now been submitted to Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley, focuses on four key investment pillars – digital and innovation infrastructure tourism-led regeneration and skills and employability.\n\nLondonderry is also currently working to secure a city deal that would help drive investment in the north west.\n\nBelfast Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey said negotiations with government would now be “ramped up”.\n\n“We’ve developed a genuine partnership and together we’re creating real momentum around the Belfast Region City Deal,” she said.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“We want to make the region a global investment destination and ensure that we make a positive dference to those living in our most deprived communities.”\n\nThe Belfast Regional City Deal envisages:\n\n• establishment of a Global Innovation Institute focusing on already successful sectors in the city, including cybersecurity, financial services, healthcare and agri-food.\n\n• creation of further centres of innovation focused on manufacturing, creative industries and le and health sciences.\n\n• investment in digital connectivity to enable businesses across the region to connect to new markets and opportunities.\n\n                            \n            \n

This will include a new landmark venue in Belfast to tell the story of the city development of facilities at Hillsborough and Carrickfergus castles an extension of the Gobbins coastal path the regeneration of Bangor seafront and a focus on bringing more visitors into the Mourne mountains and Ards Peninsula/Strangford Lough.\n\n• extension of Belfast’s Rapid Transit System to take in outlying districts.\n\n• delivery of an extensive employability and skills programme, incorporating apprenticeship schemes, with a specic focus on digital skills.\n            \n    \n    try   catch

entered into a “confidence-and-supply’ agreement with the Conservatives in June 2017 – meaning the government could be assured of the DUP’s ten votes on certain issues in  for a financial package to support key services in Northern Ireland.\n\nAhead of Tuesday afternoon’s DUP reception, Mrs Foster said the confidence-and-supply deal was “delivering” for the entire United Kingdom, and that she was looking forward to attending the conference.\n\n“It is an opportunity for us to engage with fellow unionists from throughout the UK and beyond,” she said.  \n\n“Whilst we will be hosting our own event at the conference, we will also be using the time to engage with many other delegates to ensure the needs of Northern Ireland are properly understood.”  \n\n                            \n

roads, schools and hospitals in Northern Ireland but also a better deal for the entire United Kingdom.\n\n“Our event marks the fact that we work together for the entire United Kingdom as unionists. It will also be an opportunity to explain why we need and want to leave the EU on the same basis as the rest of the UK.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n
