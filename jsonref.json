Essentially this case is going to take up the rest of this year and if it takes up the rest of this year, that\u0027s the whole of his mother\u0027s Platinum Jubilee.\u0027The only thing he could have done to stop this getting worse is to have pulled the case and stopped it in some way so there was no alternative news.

You want a jury trial? I want a jury trial. You want to bring these claims? Well, in that case, you have to prove everything that you\u0027re saying, because I\u0027m not going to admit to anything\u0027.\u0027He added the case could still settle out of court but added that \u0027nevertheless the prince is saying that he denies everything.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Kate Garraway shuts GMB cancel culture debate comic defends burkas letterbox remark","story":"Share this articleCancel culture is a grave threat to comedy - spiked"},{"url":null,"title":"Apple Music trolls Spotify proclaiming home Neil Young","story":"Share this articleShare this articleNeil Young Removes Music From Spotify in Protest of Joe Rogan Podcast - Variety"},{"url":null,"title":"A double double standards","story":"Share this article ‘No one today disputes the fact that slavery was abhorrent. But he was a man of his time,’ says one alumnus. ‘The way Jesus is treating him, you’d have thought he spent his life flogging plantation workers. In reality, he was a wealthy courtier in London who made business investments, probably because the King told him to. But because a tiny proportion of these involved slavery, his entire legacy is being shredded.‘If this stands, where does it lead? Will people in 100 years be combing through donors to cancel people whose pensions were invested in oil or tobacco firms?’Many alumni are understood to have cancelled monthly donations to the College in protest.Meanwhile, the Rustat Memorial Group has lodged a formal objection to the College’s proposals.In court next week, they are expected to argue, among other things, that Rustat’s investment in the slave trade was marginal in the context of his life, and that the College, which claimed on its website that he ‘derived great wealth’ from the Royal African Company, has misinterpreted the evidence.The group’s expert witnesses include Nigel Biggar, a distinguished Oxford professor who once upset the forces of political correctness by describing the British Empire as ‘morally mixed’.Also keeping a watchful eye on proceedings will be descendants of Rustat. One, former Chief Scientist at English Heritage Sebastian Payne — who is descended from Rustat’s brother, Robert — regards the removal of the monument as a sort of desecration of his ancestor’s grave, since it was his dying wish to be buried nearby.High-profile figures within Cambridge have also criticised the case.Prof David Abulafia, an emeritus professor of history at Cambridge, has described the shaming of Rustat as ‘virtue-signalling’. Dr Colin Kolbert, emeritus professor of law at Magdalene College, accuses Jesus of ‘entirely empty gestures’, telling me: ‘If the College really cared about having a clean conscience, they’d be giving back the money he gave them.’In response, Jesus says that returning cash would breach charity law, and argues: ‘The College is not seeking to cancel Rustat. It is applying to have his memorial moved from a place of worship to a more suitable — but still prominent — place in the College.’The fate of that ambition will soon rest in the hands of His Honour Judge David Hodge QC.While the outcome is hard to predict, the whole thing will be expensive. Bringing the case will cost Jesus around £55,000, while relocating the memorial in a listed building could cost £30,000.Even if Jesus wins, opponents are likely to appeal, pushing costs (which, since the college is a Charity, come from charitable funds) still higher.Luckily, the College has deep pockets: it’s worth around £350 million, thanks to benefactors such as the late Tobias Rustat — not to mention some deep-pocketed Chinese Communists, too."},{"url":null,"title":"Its Britains fertile land theres plan cover 2 800 acres solar panels","story":"Share this articleShare this article ‘It’s simple things like that which to a lot of people are vital for their mental health.

We\u0027re not moving women into more senior roles quickly enough – and I think it\u0027s my role as the Government\u0027s Women in Finance champion but also as a woman leading an organisation to make sure that we create the right environment for women to flourish and for women to be given the same opportunities as men. \u0027So we just need to make sure that in the way that we work, we don\u0027t jeopardise women\u0027s opportunities.\u0027Speaking about the return to work of Aviva employees, she added: \u0027My view is that we would like people to be in the office around three days a week.

In a press conference on Saturday, the electoral commission said: “All conditions have been met for the vote to take place in absolute safety.” Like many European countries, Portugal is experiencing record-setting infections, although widespread vaccination has kept deaths and hospitalisations lower than in earlier waves.

The timeline for the publication of the long-awaited report by the senior civil servant Sue Gray on alleged lockdown breaches at Downing Street and Whitehall was thrown into question this week when the politan police announced on Tuesday that a criminal investigation had been launched. Scotland Yard provoked outrage by demanding that references to matters it was examining be removed from the report. MPs labelled the force, which is investigating possible breaches punishable by fixed-penalty notices, “a broken organisation”. Miklos Kasler, the minister for human resources, blamed the Omicron variant for the rise, Reuters reports. In a Facebook video, he said the variant was causing less severe illness, but the third of Hungarians not vaccinated were at higher risk.  Just over 6 million of the country’s 10 million people have received at least two shots, and nearly 3.6 million have also received a booster, but the country’s vaccination rate lags western European levels.  Hungary is now offering shots to anyone, without people needing to register in advance, as well as booster shots to children aged 12-17.  The government announced in mid-January that a fourth Covid-19 booster shot was available should people want one, after they have had a consultation with a doctor.  Hungary has made booster shots mandatory for healthcare workers, and vaccinations mandatory for all teachers. Protective masks have been required in most indoor places since late November.Lord Morris of Aberavon was commenting on Scotland Yard’s intervention regarding the publication of Sue Gray’s inquiry report on “partygate” over concerns that its contents may affect a police investigation into possible lockdown breaches.  Morris told the PA news agency:  The Met has asked Gray, a senior civil servant, to make only “minimal reference” in her report to No 10 events that are subject to a criminal investigation, buying more time for Boris Johnson as he faces a threat to his leadership. The number has more than tripled from two weeks ago, according to the Kyodo News agency. The Osaka prefecture reported a record 10,383 casesand Tokyo 17,433, slightly down from Friday’s record of 17,631. “Now I haven’t been canvassing support so I don’t know if I’d be able to get the first group together – you’ve got to get a group first. But if you could, of course you should have a go.”The moves come as the Omicron variant leads to reduced hospital admissions despite high infection numbers. Austria will extend the maximum permitted opening hours of restaurants and shops until midnight from 5 February, and will increase the number of people able to participate in events from 25 to 50, Nehammer said. “The good thing in spite of everything in this difficult situation – the hospital numbers are at a good level, the intensive care beds, I think it’s fair to say, are at a very good level,” he said.A government Covid-19 portal registered 113,122 new cases over 24 hours, nearly double the number of daily infections just a week ago. The number of cases across Russia continues to rise sharply, with Omicron accounting for the majority. Since a brief, strict national lockdown at the beginning of the pandemic, Russia has held back on curbs, hoping instead to protect its struggling economy. But with four vaccines widely available for months, Russians remain reluctant to take them up. Just under half of the population is fully vaccinated. The Russian government has reported 330,111 deaths from Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic, the highest death toll in Europe. The figure is contradicted, however, by the statistics agency Rosstat, which counts Covid deaths under a broader definition and says the overall toll is close to double the official number."},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choiceThe Higher Education Access Route and Disability Access Route to Education schemes offer equitable access to higher education.Languages, health and engineering among areas likely to be needed by 2026Many arts graduates now entering marketing, advertising, journalism, technology and lawInstead of taking the traditional route, Denisa Zima chose an accounting apprenticeshipSubject area profiles: Law and Business"},{"url":null,"title":"leaving cert may end up as traditional exam as school profiling ruled out","story":"Officials are now understood to be examining whether it is possible to generate accredited grades in a different way that is fair and equitable.

It has already become dominant in Denmark and is likely to become dominant in the UK in the coming weeks.The UK Health Security Agency has declared the sub-lineage a “variant of investigation”, with early analysis suggesting it has a growth advantage when compared to BA.1.SeverityThere is currently no data on the severity of BA.2 compared to BA.1, and a preliminary assessment by UK officials did not find a difference in vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease between the two.In response to questions from The , Mr De Gascun said the UK risk assessment “doesn’t give too much cause for alarm at this stage”.The difference in mutations between the two subtypes allows officials to monitor the emergence of BA.1 through genome sequencing, he added.“So, while we’ve seen only small numbers of BA.2 cases in our sequencing to date, the SGTF proportion has declined from 97 per cent to 93 per cent over the last few days, so that could signal the start of something, which we will of course continue to monitor,” Mr de Gascun said.Genome sequencingAccording to figures from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), some 2,936 cases of Covid-19 in Ireland have been identified as the Omicron variant through genome sequencing between November 25th and January 17th.Of those, 2,926 were BA.1, nine were BA.2 and one was BA.3.The WHO has said that investigation into the characteristics of BA.2, including virulence, should be “prioritised independently (and comparatively) to BA.1”.Meanwhile, the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) reported an additional 5,109 PCR-confirmed cases of Covid-19 on Friday.In addition, 4,482 people registered a positive antigen test through the HSE portal on Thursday.As of 8am on Friday, 707 Covid-19 patients were hospitalised, of whom 69 were in ICU.The Department of Health said it will no longer report daily case numbers at the weekends. Covid cases reported on Mondays will take account of weekend figures, it added.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"a day of great happiness and emotion irish businessman richard o halloran reunited with family","story":"Richard O’Halloran reunited with his wife Tara and four children at Dublin Airport this morning. His wife tweeted: “Thank you everyone for all your support. We are so unbelievably happy to have him back…”Richard O’Halloran speaking to RTÉ’s Prime Time from China Irish businessman Richard O’Halloran said he is looking forward to “doing normal everyday family things” following his return home from China. Mr O’Halloran was reunited with his family in Dublin Airport this morning after he was permitted to leave China following an enforced stay of almost three years. Significant payments will continue to Chinese authorities for years following a deal struck to enable his return.Mr O’Halloran was permitted to leave China on Friday after becoming embroiled in a legal dispute involving the chairman and main shareholder of his Dublin-based company.He was reunited with his family in Dublin Airport this morning and travelled home on an Air France flight via Seoul and Paris Charles de Gaulle, arriving at Dublin Airport at 8.10am on Saturday, a spokesman confirmed. Mr O’Halloran’s wife Tara, who has helped run a high-profile campaign calling for his release over the past three years, tweeted a photo of the family all together shortly after 8am on Saturday. The family have four children - Ben (15), Amber (12), Bella (10) and Scarlett (8). Mr O’Halloran initially flew to China in 2019 during the fallout from a crowdsourcing deal for an aircraft owned by his employer, China International Aviation Leasing Service. However, despite giving evidence against the firm’s one-time chairman Min Jiedong , who was convicted of offences relating to the deal, Mr O’Halloran was prevented from leaving. At one stage, €30 million was demanded of Mr O’Halloran, while hundreds of thousands of euro were paid over to the Chinese authorities derived from income associated with the lease of the plane purchased under the original crowdsourcing deal.Happiness and emotionMr O’Halloran issued a statement this morning on his arrival back home. “This is a day of great happiness and emotion as I rejoin Tara, Ben, Amber, Isabella, and Scarlett after three years,” he said. “There was considerable input by a number of key iniduals who were central in helping to arrive at this positive outcome and it is also important that I take this opportunity to thank and to express my sincere appreciation and that of my family, for the incredible support we have received over the past three years. “Mr Simon Coveney, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, was a key figure in reaching a solution and he invested huge effort over a long period, but particularly in recent weeks, leading to a positive outcome. “My wider family and friends of the family have been so important in the support they provided both in a practical and emotional sense and with Tara I express our sincere gratitude. I would like in particular to thank my mother and father. Throughout the three-year period there have been so many people who have signed petitions, who were active on social media, who wrote letters to newspapers, and who made unsolicited generous contact with my family with offers of support and help. This generosity of spirit can never be repaid.“I would like to sincerely thank The President of Ireland, Mr. Michael D. Higgins who wrote to his counterpart in China. “A number of politicians at national and European level have been so supportive and I am sure I am missing some, but I have to sincerely express my gratitude to Deputies Charlie Flanagan TD, Peadar Tóibín TD, Eoin Ó Broin TD, Cathal Berry TD and Cormac Devlin TD Senator Michael McDowell, Senator Gerard Craughwell, Senator Barry Ward and in Europe, Barry Andrews MEP, Sean Kelly MEP, and Frances Fitzgerald MEP. Also, Councillor Hazel Chu in Dublin.“I would like to acknowledge the the kindness of the people in China who looked after me when I was unwell and also note the support of Consular officials Wendy Dorman-Smith and Alison Meagher. “I would like to sincerely thank the media in Ireland and overseas, for all the interest and support shown to Tara, my family and myself since 2019. The role of the media has been essential in maintaining awareness about the challenging situation I was in and I am very grateful for that. While I realise and understand the huge public interest, as reflected by the media, I hope in the coming period to spend time in private with my family and slowly return to normal living in Ireland.“A number of other people have been very instrumental in the background in assisting in arriving at a solution including Ulick McEvaddy my colleague in CALS Donal Martin Denis O’Brien and my brother David O’Halloran (who resides in the US). I know they are reluctant to take any credit, but I have to acknowledge their help.“Finally, and most importantly, my own family Ben, Amber, Isabella, Scarlett and especially my wife Tara. This has been an incredible challenge for them too and they endured many dark days. But they were always a beacon of light and hope for me and the hundreds of Messenger calls we had helped me to remain positive. Tara was an incredible tower of strength and kept the show on the road. I am home with them now and we are all looking forward to getting to know each other again and doing normal everyday family things.“Once again, my sincere heartfelt thanks to everybody.”Future commitmentsMr O’Halloran had to make two court appearances in Shanghai earlier this week to finalise and sign off on financial arrangements and future commitments to pave the way for the lifting of the exit ban.It is understood the financial commitments relate to future payments from the income on the aircraft that was purchased with money raised from Chinese investors and leased to a Finnish airline. The agreement is also understood to relate to the return of the aircraft to the Chinese authorities when the lease agreement ends in 2026. Monthly payments of more than $100,000 (€90,000) are currently being made to the Chinese authorities.The Chinese embassy in Dublin, confirming that Mr O’Halloran’s exit ban had been lifted, tweeted on Friday that “it is expected that he continues to fulfil his pledges and commitment and undertake his corresponding legal obligations”. The deal came at the culmination of a years-long diplomatic effort, centred on the Department of Foreign Affairs led by Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. “This has been a difficult time for Mr O’Halloran and his family,” Mr Coveney said on Friday. “The Government has been actively engaged on the matter throughout and is delighted it has reached a successful result.”Protracted processHis family were said to be delighted at the culmination of a protracted process, which saw them engage in high-profile lobbying for his release. It is understood that his wife, Tara O’Halloran, had been set to appear before the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs next week. Mr O’Halloran, a father of four, is expected back in Dublin on Saturday. However, there was criticism for the Government. Fianna Fáil MEP Barry Andrews, who lobbied for Mr O’Halloran’s release, said he was “puzzled” that Mr Coveney expressed gratitude to the Chinese authorities for their help when they were responsible for his detention.“It surprised me because it implies the Chinese authorities were blameless in the matter and clearly they weren’t,” he said.“This was a negotiation between the Irish and Chinese authorities. The implication of that is that the Chinese authorities were controlling the process and a process that had no basis in law.”Mr Andrews also criticised the Department of Foreign Affairs for not using the resources of the European Union’s delegation in Beijing to help in Mr O’Halloran’s case.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"post brexit checks for goods moving into north are not fit for purpose eu officials","story":"An anti-NI protocol sign near Larne port, one of the locations of post-Brexit agrifood checks. File photograph: Mark MarlowBloombergEU officials have said that the system for post-Brexit checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland is “not fit for purpose”.A draft report by EU officials, compiled following an audit carried out by the European Commission in June last year, is highly critical of the current system of agrifood checks and recommends a series of changes.Officials say the UK government has “failed to ensure that sufficient resources – human and structural – have been made available to the responsible competent authorities in Northern Ireland”.Since the UK left the EU, new trade arrangements have created economic barriers on the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland, with the aim being to avoid the creation of a hard Border on the island of Ireland.The latter has been achieved by effectively keeping Northern Ireland within the EU’s single market for goods, which has led to the checks on agrifood products crossing the Irish Sea into Northern Ireland from Britain.Staffing was cited as a major issue, with EU officials bemoaning an insufficient number of “suitably qualified staff so that official controls and other official activities can be performed efficiently and effectively”.‘Stunt’This week, Stormont’s DUP First Minister Paul Givan said his party colleague Edwin Poots will order a stop to the controversial checks, but the anticipated move by the North’s Minister for Agriculture has been branded a stunt by other parties in Northern Ireland.The other Executive parties insist Mr Poots does not have the authority to prevent checks required under the terms of the EU-UK Brexit withdrawal agreement, an international treaty.Unionists parties and loyalist groups have long been opposed to the post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland, arguing that they damage the union between the region and Britain.The UK and the EU remain in talks as both sides attempt to reach a deal on issues relating to the Northern Ireland protocol, the portion of the withdrawal agreement that has given rise to the trading arrangements.Among the recommendations contained in the report are calls to ensure that the authorities have access to a sufficient number of qualified staff, as well as pointing out the need for better facilities and improved information-sharing.“Undertakings given in the United Kingdom’s unilateral declarations have also not been delivered,” the report concludes.“The system in place for controlling the entry of animals and goods into the EU SPS area via Northern Ireland border control posts does not, and cannot in the current circumstances, function effectively.” – PA How is Brexit affecting you?

It takes seconds to post on social media but the fallout can last much longer. It’s important to think before you post, particularly when a matter is the subject of court proceedings or a Garda investigation. Being fair and accurate is crucial. The potentially serious consequences for overstepping the legal lines include a fine, and even jail, for contempt of court or damages for defamation. Here’s a guide to help stay on the right side of the law when you’re online. What’s the legal position when a person is arrested in connection with a criminal offence?The matter is deemed to be sub judice, meaning it’s before a court or judge, and there are clear limits on what can and cannot be said. From the time an inidual is arrestedcharged, the facts are for a court to decide. An inidual arrested and questioned in connection with a criminal offence should not be identified prior to being charged.Why can’t more details be given?Because we operate in a democracy governed by the rule of law. An accused is entitled to the presumption of innocence unless and until proven guilty. Public discussion of the case, which can sometimes be ill-informed, could prejudice a jury whose role is to decide the facts.So what can I say? It’s best to say nothing when a matter is subject of criminal proceedings. There are good reasons for this, including that information circulated about an accused or crime is sometimes inaccurate and whipping up public opinion against accused people has contributed in the past to people being convicted of offences they didn’t commit. What happens if an arrestedcharged person is identified? It depends on what is said. Anyone who publishes negative material about someone who is arrested leaves themselves open to contempt of court andor defamation proceedings. When material about a charged person, or details of the offence with which they are charged, is published, the consequences can be serious. Apart from exposing its publisher to defamation and contempt proceedings, such publication has potential to derail or even collapse a jury trial.What does defamation mean?Defamation is the publication to at least one other person of comment, inaccurate statements, false reporting or other material capable of causing damage to the reputation of a person, business or other organisation. The Defamation Act 2009 defines a “defamatory statement” as one “that tends to injure a person’s reputation in the eyes of reasonable members of society”. Anyone suing for defamation has to show there was “publication, by any means” of defamatory material concerning them to one, or more than one, person. The Act applies to ALL publications and there is a rising number of cases alleging defamation and contempt of court over online content, including social media posts. A couple received €30,000 damages against their neighbour in county Donegal who had put up a Facebook post making allegations including of an affair. Surely I can say what I like to my friends and family in my WhatsApp groups?There’s a risk in saying what you like, even on WhatsApp, if the content is defamatory. Online defamation is the publication of defamatory statements in e-mails, web postings, Facebook posts, tweets and mobile phone group messaging such as WhatsApp groups. A retweet or simple forwarding of a message can be akin to acting as the original publisher, particularly if further comment is added.What about the likes of Google, Facebook and Twitter? Can they be sued over what’s posted on their sites? E-commerce regulations mean intermediaries such as Google, Facebook and Twitter are excluded from liability under a “hosting defence” for material published on their systems where they are unaware of the defamatory, false or criminal content. If intermediaries are given notice of defamatory material, they are expected to take it down speedily if they want to benefit from the hosting defence and are not deemed to be a publisher. Orders may also be sought against internet service providers aimed at identifying posters of defamatory material. Anonymity online is not absolute due to protocols on device and internet addressing.

Once he found out where she lived he left notes for the teenager, including one saying she deserved love along with a bouquet of flowers.When he was confronted by Miss Raducanu\u0027s parents, he claimed he was delivering gifts to someone else.Magar went back to her home a few days later and delivered a map he had drawn, illustrating the 23-mile distance he had walked from his home in Edgware, north London.Two days later, he went to Miss Raducanu\u0027s home again and decorated a tree in her garden with Christmas lights. He even stole a trainer from the porch, believing it belonged to the star.However, the trainer belonged to her father, Ian, who recognised Magar had previously visited the property after seeing him in doorbell footage and followed him while informing police.In a statement, Mr Raducanu said: I received a notification on my phone from the Nest doorbell. It said someone was at the front of the house. I went outside and could see a male stood on the pavement. He began running away.When Magar was arrested he was found with the trainer in his bag, telling officers he wanted a souvenir.Magar was found guilty of stalking at Bromley magistrates\u0027 court on Friday and will be sentenced next month.In a statement read to the court, Miss Raducanu said she was worried about going out on her own.Speaking to officers from Melbourne last month while she prepared for the Australian Open, the 19-year-old said: Since all this has happened, I have felt creeped out. I feel very apprehensive if I go out, especially if I am on my own.I feel like my freedom has been taken away from me. I am constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel on edge and worried this could happen again. I don\u0027t feel safe in my own home, which is where I should feel safest.She added that it had left her wanting to move as she fears he might come back as he knows where my home is.Giving evidence on Friday, Magar said he was ashamed of his actions.District Judge Sushil Kumar said: His inability to explain how he did not think this was harassment is incapable of belief.More from NewsStorm Malik: Woman killed by falling tree as winds top 100mphTime ticks away for antique clocks as specialist repairers dwindlePrioritising Pen Farthing\u0026#39s animals over humans in the evacuation of Afghanistan was \u0026#39disgusting\u0026#39, former soldiers sayProblem gambling higher in serving RAF personnelPrincess Anne to miss Beijing Winter OlympicsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"paris no longer city culture city despair","story":"Things have come to a pretty pass when the chief Paris arts fair, FIAC, held in its present form for almost half a century, gets kicked out by the Swiss. Art Basel, now owned by a conglomerate, won a surprise tender offer from the French National Museum Authority, and will take up FIAC’s slots at the Grand Palais off the Champs Élysées for the next seven years. This stands on the very location where Manet held his 1863 “Salon des Refusés” for his daring Impressionist fellow-painters, including Pissarro and Courbet, then rejected from the grand annual Académie des Beaux-Arts Salon. Art Basel grew out of a well-regarded 1970 event launched by three gallery-owners in Switzerland’s third largest city, where the first art museum in history was created in 1661. It now gathers close to 300 galleries and representatives from 400 museums worldwide: the Swiss, untroubled by wars, revolutions, and economic crises in recent centuries, are noted collectors with taste and deep pockets. But experts fear the fair’s current iterations (they opened in Miami Beach and Hong Kong before setting their sights on Paris) have created a monster whose Paris post-victory press release, written in flawless PR-ese, featured buzzwords like “investment dynamic” and “market”. Some French gallery-owners, who are promised pride of place by the newcomers, are unhappy. “Paris, unlike, say, London, has a real, lively market, with a erse and original offer, from the very accessible to museum quality pieces. This will bring uniformisation, with a more business-like but standardised offer, highly financialised,” says one of them, the noted art adviser Cyrille de Gunzburg.To Parisians, this is but the latest instalment in a long saga of official neglect. When the fair moves back to the revamped Grand Palais, visitors and exhibitors will pass the symbol of the city’s careless acceptance of self-marketed art: Jeff Koons’s 41-ft tall, 27-ton “Tulips”, an ugly contraption of aluminium, bronze and epoxy paint where a realistic (some say “obscene”) massive pink hand holds the stems of a multi-coloured bouquet of oblong balloons. The sculpture was given to the city, supposedly to commemorate the 2015 terror attacks with the work’s €3.5 million actual construction and upkeep costs borne by unhappy Parisian taxpayers. Where noted architects once produced controversial but important works, like the Louvre’s glass pyramid entrance, cultural policy in Paris has become a mix of performative woke laziness and spendthrift subsidies. Take the beautiful 18th century Rotonde by the classical architect Claude-Nicolas Ledoux, now made into a rat-infested, graffitied “Hybrid Cultural Area” in City Hall’s newspeak, grandly called a “trattoria-lounge ouverte au clubbing et au design” (where is the Académie Française when you need it?) Or the concrete and plywood “sheep” penned by rusty railings at the Parc Monceau, once one of Paris’s most beautiful “Parcs à l’Anglaise”. Take the projected 180m-high Tour Triangle skyscraper, which even Unesco warns will change the Parisian skyline. Or the Art Déco Palais de Tokyo, overlooking the Seine: its modern art galleries have been reduced to make space for a compendium of contemporary “art” featuring skateboarding performance artists, concrete girders and “artistic interventions”, all supposedly providing, in Meghan-Markleish lingo, a “convivial and challenging, generous and cutting edge, inviting and radical, poetic and transgressive space to learn, to experience, to feel, and to live”.Meanwhile, monuments, from the 1547 Fontaine des Innocents to the unique, listed 1896 Pagoda, are first left to degrade, then replaced by modern horrors, or sold off, like the Italianate Hôtel Dieu hospital opposite Notre Dame, to become luxury hotels. The City of Light, once the world capital of culture, has become a battered old lady on her way to a dismal care home.More from NewsStorm Malik: Woman killed by falling tree as winds top 100mphTime ticks away for antique clocks as specialist repairers dwindlePrioritising Pen Farthing\u0026#39s animals over humans in the evacuation of Afghanistan was \u0026#39disgusting\u0026#39, former soldiers sayProblem gambling higher in serving RAF personnelPrincess Anne to miss Beijing Winter OlympicsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jacob rees mogg 5k bracelet","story":"Jacob Rees-Mogg got £k bracelet made from mane of Wellingtons horse for ChristmasThe posh Tory Commons leader denied being out of touch despite paying people to change his childrens nappies and owning a bracelet made from the hair of the charger Wellington rode at the Battle of Waterloo Image: AFP via Getty ImagesByMikey SmithWhitehall Correspondent:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan |commentsJacob Rees-Mogg has denied being aposout of touchapos, despite getting a bracelet made from the mane of Wellingtonaposs horse for Christmas.

Yet we’ve just seen the Chancellor write off £.billion stolen from taxpayers by criminals who abused the furlough schemes. Lesson: don’t be exploited on the minimum wage by amoral firms kids, set up your own one. We tell those who want to become a senior public servant, such as an MP, that they must swear an oath to the Queen vowing “true allegiance” to herself and all her “heirs and successors, according to law”.Yet one of them, her second son, is Prince Andrew. The very sight of whom, I’m guessing, makes most young people want to swear in a dferent way.  Then there’s Robert Halfon, chair of the Commons Education Select Committee, claiming thatschoolkids want to succeed they need to follow the example of James Dyson. That’s the vacuum cleaner tycoon who ­championed Vote Leave due to the economic opportunities it would bring British industry before moving his global head office to Singapore. In other words, kids, talk the talk, then screw your country, andanyone complains, tell them to suck it up. But what must really puzzle them now is why they need to be truthful. We teach them that honesty is the best policy and cheats never prosper, yet the man elected to the top job in the country is acknowledged by even his closest colleagues to be a liar and a cheat.

There would have been no need for a drawn-out Sue Gray report or the drip-drip of leaks about illegal drinks in Nothe people who made the rules we were all ordered to follow had owned up to breaking them and faced the consequences. And as Johnson looks to ride out whatever damning conclusions are in that report and carry on as though nothing happened, what does that tell young people on the cusp of adult le  Especially one who has a Tory MP, who, rather than call Johnson out for what he is, cheered him on as he brazened out his shame in the Commons. Or a Tory MP who waits to see how the report’s conclusions play with their constituents before calculating the best course for themselves. Then there’s the country’s top cop, whose skin has been repeatedly saved by the PM, refusing to investigate criminal allegations against him until a report about them is set to be released, then stepping in to effectively censor it. Our revised advice to kids should be that cheats do prosper and honesty’s not the best policy. Looking after No  is. But the next time you give a young person a lecture about decency don’t be surprised , like the people running the country, they laugh in your face.

It should have investigated the partying in Downing Street as soon as it was revealed by this paper. Now, after eventually deciding there was sufficient evidence to launch a criminal inquiry, The Met has demanded Sue Gray delays releasing parts of her report. Whether by accident or design, it has been a helpful ally of Boris Johnson who is playing for time in the hope the scandal will blow over. It may be in his interests to prolong matters but it is certainly not in the country’s. For as long as Partygate remains unresolved the Government is effectively paralysed. The quickest way out of this unsatisfactory situation would have been for him to resign. We don’t need an investigation to know he attended at least one party during lockdown or that his initial denials misled Parliament. A Prime Minister who is honourable and decent would have quit by now. But that is not Boris Johnson, who instead limps on as a discredited and diminished figure. What a choice Nobody should have to decide to heat or eat. But that is the choice facing an increasing number as living costs bite. Not everyone is struggling. The oil giants Shell and BP are set to record bumper profits. Shell rakes in more per hour than an average nurse earns in a year. While they laugh all the way to the bank, millions turn to foodbanks. Labour’s plan for a windfall tax on these firms would raise £.billion – enough to cut VAT on fuel and increase the warm homes discount. It speaks volumes that the Tories have rejected the proposal.  Green vision A battery plant is being built on the site of Blyth’s old coal-fired power station. The place that powered the industrial revolution is now powering the green revolution.

It comes as the Prime Minister could finally get sight of the highly anticipated partygate inquiry report from senior civil servant Sue Gray as early as this weekend, after police insisted they had not delayed its publication. No  had still not received a copy of the report into possible lockdown breaches in Downing Street and Whitehall on Saturday morning.It is widely believed that either Chancellor Rishi Sunak or Foreign Secretary Liz Truss are frontrunners to win the top jobthe Prime Minister is ousted.But the Daily Mail reported on Friday that centrist Tories are backing Mr Tugendhat, an ex-soldier. The newspaper said some Conservative MPs believe the Foreign Affairs Committeechairman represents the best chance for a fresh start. The MP for Tonbridge and Malling told Times Radio on Saturday: I think Iaposm making it pretty clear that I think that itaposs up to all of us to put ourselves forward. And itaposs up to the electorate, in the first case parliamentary colleagues, and in the second case the party, to choose. I think itaposs a position of absolute integrity to say that of course you should offer yourself to the electorateyou think you can do it. Of course you should talk to colleagues and seeyou can get a group together, andyou can get a group together you should go for it. Now I havenapost been canvassing support so I donapost knowIaposd be able to get the first group together - youaposve got to get a group first. Butyou could, of course you should have a go.  On being Prime Minister, he said: It would be a huge privilege. Itaposs one of those questions that I know many people ask and some people, some of my colleagues, are coy about and I donapost understand why. I donapost think you should be embarrassed to want to serve your country. I was very proud to serve my country in the armed forces and I got to the highest rank I could so that I could have the best effect that I could. And I was very proud to serve as a diplomat around the world. Mr Tugendhat has previously been critical of the Governmentaposs handling of the UK withdrawal from Afghanistan. In December, he said there had been a lack of leadership, urgency and adequate resourcing in the evacuation from Kabul. After a session of the FAC, he said: The evidence weaposve heard today points to a lack of leadership, urgency and adequate resourcing. It is deeply painful how badly we have let Afghanistan down. As questions persist over the future of his premiership, it is understood Mr Johnson will ramp up deterrence to avoid bloodshed between Russia and Ukraine with a visit to the region in the coming days amid rising tensions. The Prime Minister will also speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin over the phone. The publication of the long-awaited Gray report into alleged lockdown-busting parties was thrown into disarray on Tuesday when politan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick, who had long resisted calls to investigate, announced her officers had opened a criminal inquiry. Scotland Yard confirmed on Friday evening that it had received the material requested from the Cabinet Office to support its investigation. The force said officers would examine this without fear or favour to establish whether any rules were broken. The Met had been criticised by legal experts and Tory MPs for urging Ms Gray to limit the publication of her investigation into allegations of lockdown-breaking parties at No , but the force insisted it had not delayed the report. Commander Catherine Roper, who leads the Metaposs Central Specialist Crime Command, said the timing of the documentaposs release was a matter for the Cabinet Office. The PA news agency understands that Mr Johnson could receive a copy over the weekend, or in the coming week, rather than in weeks or months. But it is understood it will comply with any police requests, meaning certain details could be excluded. Downing Street declined to comment on the Met statement on Friday.  The Cabinet Office did not offer further comment on when the document would be published. Ms Roper said the force had asked for minimal reference to be made in the report to the relevant events, to protect the integrity of the police investigation and to be as fair as possible to those who are subject to it. This will only be necessary until these matters are concluded, and is to give detectives the most reliable picture of what happened at these events. We intend to complete our investigations promptly, fairly and proportionately, she said. We have not delayed this report and the timing of its release is a matter for the Cabinet Office inquiry team. Ms Roper said the offences under investigation, where proven, would normally result in the issuing of a fixed penalty notice. Should a recipient dispute the fixed penalty notice then the case will be referred back to the Met where officers will consider whether to pursue the matter in a magistratesapos court, she said. As the commissioner said, we will not be giving a running commentary but we will continue to update when signicant progress is made in the investigative process.

It appears the top civil servant will have to split her report in two after the Met Police asked her to cut some references to gatherings it’s investigating. And itaposs been reported the redacted version could be published as soon as Monday  January.But a late or half-baked report could fall short of the “killer blow” to Boris Johnson ’s authority that triggers a leadership challenge.And the PM clearly thinks heaposs in the clear for now - and is spending the weekend kicking back at Chequers.Sir Keir Starmer said the government was “paralysed” by the chaos, which has come after days of briefing and counter-briefing about the report. Labour ’s leader said: “While the Tories are focused on this charade of Boris Johnson’s making, people around the country are worried about paying their bills, whether they can afford to fill up their car, and about the tax rises about to be imposed on them in a few weeks’ time.“They are getting no answers from a government mired in sleaze and scandal.” Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “This gets murkier by the minute.“Sue Gray and the Met are in dficult positions but the sequence of events and the situation arrived at now creates the suspicion - however unfairly - that the process of inquiry is aiding Johnson at the expense of public accountability.” Here’s what on earth is going on - and what might happen next.What is the Sue Gray report  Top civil servant Sue Gray is investigatinga string of parties between May  and April  - mostly in No and its garden.The -year-old took over the inquiry from Cabinet Secretary Simon Case after it emerged a party had been held in his own office. Her probe was set up to get “a general understanding of the nature of the gatherings”. That means saying who attended, the “setting and the purpose”, and “reference to adherence to the guidance in place at the time”. But she cannot rule whether the PM broke the lawor the Ministerial Code . And the names of junior staff are likely to be kept anonymous. Disciplinary action will be kept secret too. When is the Sue Gray report due - and why is it delayed Her report was due this week, with Boris Johnson promising to publish it within a short time of receiving it. But it was thrown into chaos after the Met Police began investigating “a number of” the Downing Street gatherings she’d looked at. Government and police officials are wrangling over what parts of the report could prejudice a police investigation. Sources claimed earlier this week that Scotland Yard had no objection to the report being published. But after days of confusion, the Met Police said: For the events the Met is investigating, we asked for minimal reference to be made in the Cabinet Office report.  The Met did not ask for any limitations on other events in the report, or for the report to be delayed, but we have had ongoing contact with the Cabinet Office, including on the content of the report, to avoid any prejudice to our investigation. This means the report now has to be either published with key details missing, or delayed entirely, or in full defying the police - a terrible choice for Ms Gray. On Friday evening, it was reported the redacted version would be sent to Number  shortly. No will then decide when to publish it, with the government previously suggesting this would happen when Parliament is sitting - meaning it could be as soon as Monday.Do the police have a good reason for this Scotland Yard’s decision prompted bafflement after the force spent weeks not investigating, only to launch one at the worst moment. Lawyers point out Sue Gray’s report is very unlikely to prejudice any court case, because lockdown breaches are almost always punished with on-the-spot fines.Nazir Afzal, a former chief Crown prosecutor for the North West, said onTwitter: This is absolute nonsense from the Met Police. A purely factual report by Sue Gray cannot possibly prejudice a police investigation. They just have to follow the evidence, of which the report will be a part.Top barrister Adam Wagner, who is an expert on Covid rules, tweeted: I am not a criminal lawyer so perhaps I am missing something.  How would a factual civil service report about events the police is investigating aposprejudiceapos their investigation  Former No aide Nick Timothy said it was “absurd to say that publishing Gray derails a police investigation prosecution. These are fixed penalty notice offences.”But others pointed out that Scotland Yard wants to “avoid any prejudice to ourinvestigation” - “investigation”, not prosecution.Nick Aldworth, a former Met chief superintendent, said knowing what’s in the report could “give the potential defendants an opportunity to conceal or alter evidence. Barrister Andrew Keogh tweeted: aposCriminal proceedings’ does not just mean a trial, so prejudice to them also means the investigation. Giving a potential suspect early sight of other evidence may for eg risk prejudice. We need to think wider on this one. Police slammed for not acting, now for doing it properly.Why is there so much confusion over the release date The Mirror understands confusion was worsened by an anonymous briefing from the Met. Police sources claimed on Tuesday that Scotland Yard had no objection to Sue Grayaposs report being published in full. But No later learned this was not, in fact the case. The opposite was actually true, and Scotland Yard still had questions over the report. Will the Sue Gray report be published in full No has repeatedly promised to publish the full findings of Sue Gray - in other words, the same report she hands to No. But the more relevant question is how much Sue Gray’s report will be “self-censored” before it gets to No. Even before the Met statement, the Mirror understood it would not contain all the evidence she received, only a summary, and could leave out inidual staff names. This meant it would not contain elements like text exchanges or photos of Boris Johnson with wine bottles. Now that the Met Police have intervened, whole parts of Sue Gray’s account - by definition the most damaging ones - could be left out too.Will this all help Boris Johnson Most observers think it will. The timing of the report is crucial for Boris Johnson because it affects his own MPs trying to topple him as Prime Minister.  Tory MPs need to send no confidence letters to trigger a leadership challenge, and many were waiting for the outcome of Sue Gray’s report before deciding. One Tory elected in  told the Mirror things had “quietened down in the past week”, adding: “Sometimes you get to the precipice, look over and go ‘aagh!’.” Pushing any conclusions into the long grass could allow the Prime Minister more time to “sort out” Downing Street and satisfy his MPs with a response. It could also ensure media coverage and public outrage over the scandal die down, meaning evendozens of people are fined, he survives politically. Meanwhile, publishing a half-baked report now will allow him to deflect and bluster, claiming he’s been exonerated by a half-report. There are no good options.Did Boris Johnson talk to the Met to ensure a ‘stitch-up’ Downing Street insisted it did not ask Sue Gray’s team to go back to the Met to ensure her report did not interfere with police investigations. A spokesman for Boris Johnson said: “It’s an independent investigation. we haven’t been privy to the details of that investigation or any of its content. “So that would be a matter for the investigations team and the Met.” AskedNo  had any conversations with the Met about the Gray report and what could be published, the spokesman said: “Not that I’m aware of, no.” Askedit was correct that the announcement from the Met – that they asked for the Gray report to make minimal reference to alleged events they are investigating – had no involvement from No , the spokesman said: “I believe that’s correct.” He added: “I’m not across the detail, it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to be so.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Downing Street party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The row casts fresh doubt on the PMaposs integrity as he waits for the results of Sue Grayaposs report into Downing Street parties. Sir Philip, the Foreign Officeaposs permanent under-secretary, initially told the committee that Mr Casey had not received any correspondence about the PMaposs involvement.But leaked emails, published by the BBC, show Mr Casey asked an official to seek clear guidance for us from No  asap on what they would like us to do in the case.Sir Philip has now written to the committeeaposs chairman Tom Tugendhat to apologise for giving inadvertently inaccurate answers. But he said that on the day the email was sent, Nigel was almost entirely focused, in his role as Gold in our crisis response, on the terrorist threat to the evacuation. Labouraposs Chris Bryant, who sits on the committee, said: “The disaster of our withdrawal from Afghanistan requires the highest level of scrutiny. Parliament can only do thisthere is transparency from Government. “Since we published internal Foreign Office emails earlier this week, further emails have come to light that make it dficult to have confidence that we are getting full answers from the department.” The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan last year is being scrutinised by the Foreign Affairs Committee amid ongoing questions about the Governmentaposs handling of the crisis.  Sir Philip was criticised when he admitted he had stayed on holiday for nearly two weeks after Kabul fell to the Taliban. The-then Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also failed toimmediately from a family holiday in Crete. The evacuation of animals looked after by the Nowzad charity sparked a major controversy as thousands of people trying to flee the Taliban were left behind. Downing Street has repeatedly denied intervening to help Mr Farthing, who was able to evacuate  cats and dogs from the country using a plane funded by donations raised in a high profile campaign But an email shared with MPs by whistleblower Raphael Marshall showed a Foreign Office official saying that the Prime Minister had authorised the animalsapos rescue.And the BBC reported another email from the same day saying then-foreign secretary Dominic Raab was seeking a steer from No  on whether to call Nowzad staff forward.Another email from Mr Casey showed him asking a security official to seek clear guidance for us from No  asap on what they would like us to do.  The emails to the Commons inquiry were submitted by Mr Marshall, who worked for the Foreign Office at the time and alleges the animals were evacuated following an order from Mr Johnson.Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg tried to downplay the dispute as fussing about a few animals.Downing Street sought to argue the officials in the first correspondence to be published may have been mistaken. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: Itaposs not uncommon in Whitehall for a decision to be interpreted or portrayed as coming directly from the Prime Minister even when thataposs not the case, and itaposs our understanding thataposs what happened in this instance. We appreciate it was a frenetic time for those officials dealing with this situation. Mr Farthing submitted a five-page statement defending his actions to the committee, saying the animals were transported in the hold of the plane which is not safe for humans. He said the charity had offered seats on the plane to British evacuees but their offer was turned down by the Government.

The latest changes are advisory, so non-compliance will not result in a fine. A hierarchy of road users is also being introducedCyclists are advised to ride in the centre of lanes on quieter roads Image: Getty ImagesByNeil Lancefield:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan |comments A major revamp of the Highway Code to boost protection for cyclists and pedestrians comes into force today amid concern millions of drivers are unaware of the changes.The new guidance means traffic should give way when pedestrians are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions. Cyclists are advised to ride in the centre of lanes on quieter roads, in slower-moving traffic, and when approaching junctions, to make themselves as visible as possible.A hierarchy of road users is also being introduced, meaning drivers will have more responsibility to watch out for people cycling, walking, or riding a horse, and cyclists will have more responsibility to be aware of pedestrians. Turning traffic should now give way when pedestrians are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions.  And motorists will be encouraged to adopt the so-called ‘Dutch Reach’, opening the door next to them with the opposite hand so they look over their shoulder, meaning they’re more likely to spot and less likely to injure passing cyclists and pedestrians. The Highway Code contains advice and rules for people on Britain’s roads. Nine sections have been updated, with  rules added or amended. The changes are advisory, so non-compliance will not result in a fine. AA president Edmund King expressed concern at the potential impact of the guidance to give way to pedestrians at junctions. He suggested that drivers are “likely to get hit by another vehicle from behind”they stop on dual carriageways or fast-flowing A roads to let someone cross. He also warned that pedestrians could be endangeredone vehicle gives way but another travelling in the opposite direction fails to stop.  “Drivers will have to make their own judgments on what they should do in the scenarios they find themselves in,” Mr King said. “However,the judgments of the driver and the pedestrian are at odds on a very busy road, this could lead to problems.” An AA survey of more than , drivers carried out earlier this month indicated that % were unaware of the changes. A communications drive will be launched by the Department for Transport’s road safety offshoot Think! in mid-February, with further activity later in the summer. Roads minister Baroness Vere said this week that the updated Highway Code will make Britain’s roads safer and encourage people to “respect and consider the needs of those around them”. Charity Cycling UK said the changes must be “communicated with simple, accurate and memorable messaging”.  of the major changes . Hierarchy of road users A new hierarchy means people in charge of vehicles that can cause the most harm in the event of a collision have the greatest responsibility to look out for other road users. . Walking, cycling or riding in shared spaces Cyclists should not overtake people walking or riding a horse in shared spaces closely or at high speed, while pedestrians should take care not to obstruct paths. . Positioning of cyclists Cyclists should make themselves as visible as possible by riding in the centre of lanes on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions. . Pedestrians crossing at junctions Turning traffic should give way when people are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions. Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings. . Overtaking cyclists Drivers travelling at speeds of up to mph should leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists. They should give more space when overtaking at higher speeds. . Opening car doors Car occupants should open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder. This technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opened into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists. . Overtaking cyclists at junctions When cyclists are going straight ahead at a junction, they have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise. . Cycling in groups People cycling can ride two abreast but should be considerate of the needs of other road users when in groups. . Roundabouts Drivers should take extra care when entering roundabouts to make sure they do not cut across cyclists. . Electric vehicle charging Electric car owners using a public chargepoint should park near the device and avoid creating a trip hazard from trailing cables.

Conor Stapleton has the bizarre condition where his feet point almost perpendicular to the ground all the time.This leaves the -month-old unable to walk properly.Worried mum Jade Hatton first spotted the issue when Conor was around -weeks-old, Manchester Evening News reported.She said that she was told by health visitors to monitor his mobility on two occasions, but in the nearly two years since she claims his situation has only grown more dire and left him unable to walk or even put on shoes. Jade, from Hyde in Greater Manchester, said: “[Doctors] checked him when he was born, but didn’t say anything. But when he was -weeks-old, I could tell there was something wrong with his feet.  “I said to the health visitor that his feet were pointed, the visitor said he was fine. “When he got to about nine months, they were questioning me why he wasn’t trying to walk, or stand against things to bend down and pick things up. “I said it was because of his feet. They said ‘wait until he’s one’, then ‘wait until he’s  months’. Growing ever more worried, the -year-old mum took her son to the GP. They confirmed Conor was suffering from tight tendons, meaning he can only perch on his toes for a brief amount of time.  After already being referred to one hospital, the mum says she then had to aposwait months for an appointmentapos to see a specialist at a second hospital. She added: “Then in June last year, I went to the doctor again who said it was tight tendons, it took them ages to get me an appointment. “I went to Tameside Hospital, where the doctor said it was tight tendons, I then had to wait two, three months for an appointment at the Royal Manchester Childrenaposs Hospital. When Jade and Conor finally reached the doctor who would be putting casts on his feet in order to begin to correct his standing, the family were told he was apostoo ticklishapos, claims Jade. The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  Now, she says she has been referred back to Tameside, leaving her confused. Jade continued: “I went on January , took him in. The [doctor] sat down, she felt his feet and said ‘he’s too ticklish - to make my job easier, I’m not going to put his cast on today, I’m going to wait until he’s older and know why he’s having it done’. “Those were the doctor’s actual words. That appointment was specically for him to have his casts on because he can’t wear shoes, it’s a struggle putting his socks on. He can’t do anything at all. Not only are Conoraposs pointed feet giving him trouble learning to walk, there are other huge development impacts, adds the mum. “It’s made him extremely clingy to me, said Jade. Even when I take him to playgroups, he won’t go over to other children, and they won’t come over to him because he’s crawling. “So he can’t interact or play with them. “When he’s standing against the couch, he’s flopping back down and hurting his leg or banging his head. He’s learned to walk on his knees, and they’re getting bruised. “He just stays at home most of the time, playing with his cars or reading his books because that’s all he can do. “I wanted to take him to nursery, but he won’t be able to do things children his age do because they go out at playtime or go for walks in the woods. He would have to be in a pram. “And he’s getting that stressed and upset now because he can’t get about, he’s starting to have bad mood swings. “If he wants to climb on something and I don’t have the time to pick him up straight away, he’ll scream because he can’t get up on his own yet because of his feet.A complaint has been lodged with the NHS apos Patient Advice and Liaison Serviceby the mum, but she says she fears it could be aposyearsapos before Conor gets his casts - as delays to treatments across the health system continue in the wake of the pandemic. “I feel like screaming because I’ve been saying this since he was -weeks-old. I think people feel like it’s not a big deal because he’s not theirs, they don’t have to deal with him getting stressed and upset. “I rang PALS to complain and they came back to me saying they wanted a doctor to go over his feet again for the third time, she says. “The PALS staff member told me thatI didn’t hear back in a week, to let them know. It’s been about two-and-a-half weeks and I’ve heard nothing back. “It just feels like I’m not being listened to. He really needs casts to help him because his feet are so pointed. “My friend’s kids, who are even younger than him, who are walking, he can’t do anything like that. It puts a knot in my chest because he can’t walk, he can’t play. “I’ve been trying my hardest since he was -weeks-old and I don’t know what to do anymore, I’m stuck.  Adding to her anxiety, Jade is pregnant again and cannot continue to pick Conor up to carry him around like she used to. “I’m also  weeks pregnant, says Jade. I can’t keep carrying him aroundhe needs to go somewhere, itaposs putting pressure on my stomach and back lting him up. Iaposve had miscarriages in the past. But he canapost have a regular bed, he needs a cot that I have to lt him out of, because he could roll out and not be able to get back up. My partner works nights so itaposs usually me there. Heaposs like a baby thataposs as heavy as a toddler. I feel like Iaposm on my own. A spokesperson for Manchester University Foundation Trust, which runs the Royal Manchester Childrenaposs Hospital, said: “Conor’s mother has been in touch with our Patient Advice and Liaison Service and they’ll be discussing his referrals and treatment with her directly.” Tameside and Glossop Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust Fountain declined to comment.

I was part of the Re:Act Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. The NHS was under the cosh at the time and I was part of the RE:ACT Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. I helped build the Nightingale hospitals in Wales and also worked with the local council in Hereford to distribute PPE. Now I’m at the pop-up vaccination centre in Hereford. There are two of us here who are ex-military – the other guy is an ex-submariner so we’ve got a broad range of skills. There’s not a lot that comes across our path that bamboozles us.The first time I volunteered was on a day off from work. We were tasked with letting people know about the vaccination centre, but of course we didn’t want to browbeat them so we let people come to us. Initially people thought we were giving out lateral flow tests – we’d say, No, we’re here for boosters or your first or second vaccination. It was quiet for the first hour, but word obviously spread around Hereford and by the end of the day I’d say we’d vaccinated about  people, from schoolkids upwards. I think . per cent of people were happy to have a vaccination. I thought: Evenyou get five people vaccinated, that’s five people who won’t suffer.” Yes, you might catch it, but you’re much less likely to end up in hospital. When people ask meI think it works, I feel like I can provide the back story for them.We’ve now even had people come in for their first jabs. I asked one, What changed your mind  He said,Omicron, because it’s more infectious’. I just said, “Well done.”So while I don’t strong-arm people, I do tell them, “I think you should get vaccinated. ‘We all need the booster so that le can get back to normal’  I joined the Royal Air Force in  and my last posting was out in Cyprus, but I always wanted to transition to a career in the NHS. Back in October  I joined the East of England Covid- mass vaccination programme and my first role was to provide support in the planning and delivery of large-scale centres, hospital hubs and community pharmacies. Now I’m working as the children’s project manager, leading and coordinating plans. This involves collating, analysing and improving plans, reporting to the programme director and the national team, using my past experiences to collaborate, advise and implement processes.  I’m good at seeing a problem and thinking outside the box to solve it. I can get parachuted into a project within the Covid- programme and am able to run with it. Every day is dferent, but that doesn’t faze me. I’m very adaptable and flexible – and I’ll give  per cent to achieving the common goal. Working with other people from the Forces means there’s a great sense of camaraderie. We share the same service ethos. If there’s a deadline, we’ll just knuckle down and get the job done. This is not a - job. Even though I might have to get up at .am to jump on a work call, I have no problem with that. I was motivated to join the Covid- programme by my sense of duty, and I’m really proud to be part of it. I have a passion for helping people and making sure things are completed to the highest standard. This gives me a real sense of achievement. I like being able to make a dference. The public response to getting boosted has been great, but there is still a long way to go. I believe the Get Boosted Now campaign is so important because we need to protect ourselves, the vulnerable and the future generations. We also need to get everyone boosted so we can get le back to normal as soon as possible. ‘One of my ex-soldiers gave me the Covid- jab’  I was  when I joined the Navy as a medic. It was the year after the Falklands War and I thought I’d like to get involved in something for the service of the country – to do what’s necessary when the time comes. As a Navy medic I was trained to deal with trauma from the very basic things up to the most drastic ones you could think of, like gunshots and traumatic amputations. After  years, I left in  to join the Army, then in  I moved to the NHS. During the pandemic I was initially asked to oversee the distribution of PPE. There were shortages across the board, and having worked overseas with the Royal Marines, my logistics knowledge came to the fore. I could make sure community midwives and health visitors had what they needed. In some cases this entailed doing the deliveries myself in the van!  For me, the pleasure in the role was being able to provide medical staff with the assurance that they would have the equipment they needed. I felt I was making a real dference. When the time came to get my Covid- jab, it was one of my former soldiers who gave me it. That was very impressive because when I met him he was , wide-eyed and fresh out of the box. When I next met him he was teaching the volunteers and St John’s Ambulance staff how to administer the vaccine. I was full of admiration for him. He’d stepped up as a young man and was teaching much more mature iniduals. But I wasn’t surprised – that’s what we expected our troops to do: step into the breach, wherever the breach happens to be. You can’t praise the veterans highly enough for getting involved in the vaccine campaign. They will serve their community in whatever circumstances, whether it’s dficult or easy. You’ve got a group of people who drop everything as soon as they’re asked, regardless of what their family commitment might be, and go and do the job. I don’t think there is a better resource for the country to draw upon.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON British ArmyRoyal Air ForceNHSRoyal MarinesFalklands WarNigel JonesJake WadeHelen RobertsHospitalsSoldiersArmed forcesTeenagersThe FalklandsMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"giant red king crabs russia","story":"Giant red king crabs from Russia which can grow up to ft appear in British watersThe super-sized sea creatures have been showing up off the Yorkshire coast, where they’ve prompted feelings of both fear and joy among fishermen\" content\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES n _PAY-Claws-of-a-giant-crab-a-threat-a-danger-a-caution.jpg\" width\"\" \"\" There are fears the monsters might chomp up all of the scallops and brown crabs in UK watersImage: Alamy Stock PhotoByAlice Peacock:,  Jan |comments Britain is being invaded by giant red king crabs from Russia, which can grow close to ft across and weigh up to lbs. The super-sized sea creatures have been showing up off the Yorkshire coast, where they’ve prompted feelings of both fear and joy among fishermen.The iety of crab has a hard upper shell and can measure a huge  inches across the body. While the sweet-fleshed species’ popularity with chefs means they are a lucrative catch for fishermen, there are also fears the monsters might chomp up all of the scallops and brown crabs.One fisherman told theSun Online: “I’m really excited, but worried about our native seafood.” Giant red king crabs are native to North America, though scientists introduced them to Russia in the s and they thrived in the Arctic Ocean. They soon exploded in numbers, with fishermen benefiting financially from their adundance. The huge crabs then travelled to ­Norway, where they sparked another fishing boom. Most recently, the crabs have been found in UK waters where, aside from the odd one fished up in recent years, they have never been seen in signicant numbers. Fish supplier Shaun Henderson, who sells to more than  restaurants, said one of his fishermen pulled up st of king crabs off Bridlington, East Yorks this week.  It was the first time anyone in his family had caught a king crab, he said, despite them having fished in the area for two generations. While he was excited about the new catch, he was also wary, he said, due to how invasive the species seemed. The giant crabs appeared to be eating both the scallops and the brown crabs, which made Mr Henderson worry about seafood native to the UK. He said king crabs had made fishermen a lot of money in Norway, but had simultaneously depleted the populations of other sea creatures. While Will Murray, head chef at Fallow restaurant in St James’s Market, central London, has bought some of the crabs, he said he has “mixed feelings” about their appearance in the UK. While he described the giant crabs as a premium ingredient that accounted for some of the best seafood in the world, he noted there were possibly negative implications of their appearance. “We’re excited, but a bit terried, as they are invaders and could kill our brown crabs,” he said. He said the species could be the next grey squirrel, but at least they were easy to cook and enjoyable to eat.

The pair both went to St Andrews University in Scotland and threw themselves into student le. This meant visiting the townaposs famous student haunts, where Kate reportedly often saw Prince William getting hit on by girls while they were out partying together. Although they werenapost an item at the time, Kate was close to the prince - and even came up with a clever trick to help him out when things got a bit awkward with members of the opposite sex.  Speaking to royal expert Katie Nicholl for her book Kate: The Future Queen, their friend Laura Warshauer said: Will was getting really hit on by this girl at a party and it was getting quite uncomfortable because he couldnapost shake her off. He was being really polite, but this girl just didnapost get the hint. All of a sudden Kate came up behind him and put her arms around him.

He said aposOh, sorry, but Iaposve got a girlfriendapos, and he and Kate went off giggling. William was very grateful for her help, and according to Laura, he mouthed thanks so much to her afterwards. She said: Kate was the only girl in the room who could have done that. And that was just a month after we started university. However, Kate and William didnapost stay friends for very long - thataposs because their close bond eventually blossomed into romance.  The pair began dating - staying together throughout their university days and after their graduation. In , Kate and William briefly split and sources later said the Queen was disappointed by the break-up. But the split seemed to be short-lived as weeks later, William and Kate were seen kissing at an army party at barracks in Bovington, Dorset. And in July , Kate and her brother James were seen at the Concert for Diana, held at Wembley to mark  years since William’s mother Princess Dianaaposs death. It wasn’t long before their romance was confirmed to be back on, and Kate moved into William’s Clarence House flat, where he wouldfrom military duties on Friday nights for cosy weekends together - and the rest they say is history. Theyaposve now been married almost  years and have three children - Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.

And for girls, the list includes Bertha, Beverley, Carol, Carole, Doreen, Gail, Gertrude, Gillian, Glenys, Glynis, Hilary, Jeanette, Jill, Kay, Kerry, Lesley, Lindsay, Lyndsey, Lynne, Lynsey, Mandy, Maureen, Muriel, Phyllis. There were many more monikers Babbel considered to be aposendangeredapos, which were those featured in the top  between - but  or fewer babies with the name recorded in .

Speaking about the findings, Ted Mentele, Editor in Didactics at Babbel, said: Naming practices form the basis of all language as well as the basis of identity. The fact that the etymological roots of these names can be traced back to dferent languages and cultures from around the world shows how languages have impacted on each other over time. We hope that by drawing attention to the overlooked roots and intriguing meanings of these endangered names, we can give them a new lease of le for the next generation, and save them from being forgotten.” While Dr Harry Parkin, Editor of The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain, added: “Exactly why certain names become especially frequent and why certain names die out is very complex. Sometimes, certain vocabulary will be used because it is seen as prestigious.Popular culture is certainly a relevant aspect. Or, certain vocabulary might be used in certain groups and communities. Vocabulary useis therefore linked with a sense of identity. The Norman Conquest then had aconsiderable impact on the given name stock of England.

He was warned of the dangers of tattoo removal though, including the risk of scarring. Chris Johnson White, managing director of the beauty salon, said: Someone once came to us with a lipstick kiss on their bum and needed it removed because his we didnapost like it because it wasnapost hers.Weaposve had people come to us who have wanted a portrait of their nan for example and ended up with Boris Johnson. We get a lot of people wanting their ex partneraposs name removed. Iaposve also seen some really ugly tattoos in some really strange places and a fair few spelling mistakes. People coming to get football badges removed as well. Liverpool Echo reports young people often get large and creative inkings, the type of which Chris says he most frequently has to remove.But Chris himself came to resent his three designs - a swallow, a tribal sign and a Chinese symbol - and has had at least one removed. He also had the names of two ex-partners removed. I got them done when I was young and stupid. I just wanted tattoos but as I got older I realised they just didnapost look right, the entrepreneur added. They were dotted all over my arm and my plan was to get them removed and then possibly covered up, but now I just want them fully gone.  Iaposm over tattoos and wish Iaposd never got them in the first place. I thinktheyaposd matched Iaposd have kept them but they were random and it just looked like they had been scribbled on. Iaposd recommend people really think about their tattoo designs andthey do want one, think about the future. They are going to be there forever and they can be costly, but removals are also pricey, especiallythe tattoo is large. Tattoo removal is a slow process which takes one visit every six weeks to allow the body to heal thoroughly. Using a special machine with intense laser beams, it heats up the tattoo molecules and breaks them down so the body absorbs it and is eventually flushed out. But the darker the skin tone, or more colours used, the harder a tattoo is to remove.  Chris, who runs the beauty salon with partner Curtis Meldrum, continued: Eyebrows are also a popular one. Previously when semi-permanent make-up became a thing, eyebrows were very blocky and looked like they had been tattooed on. Whereas now, people want more of a natural look, sosomeone does have a blocky eyebrow we need to fade that as much as possible to get it removed to then be able to re-tattoo over it. That is something we see a lot of. I find women have a higher pain threshold than men but I tend to use a cooling gel or numbing cream for the process. If you do want a tattoo, think long and hard about it first. Make sure you go to a professional using high quality inks and research your artist thoroughly. If you need it removed, research the removal thoroughly. Iaposve had to revise someoneaposs removal work because theyaposd bought vouchers off the internet and it ended really bad, again it comes back to researching. And donapost get a partneraposs name tattooed on you. Partners arenapost forever but tattoos are.

The remains of the boy found were found last year but the anniversary has prompted a fresh appeal by police. A dog walker discovered the babyaposs body at Brackenwood Golf Course in Wirral, Merseyside, sparking an emotional response from the community. But forensic experts were unable to establish how long the baby’s body had been at the location. A plea for the babyaposs family to come forward and DNA investigations were unsuccessful. During an inquest hearing held at Gerald Majella Courthouse in September , senior coroner Andre Rebello said despite extensive examinations by two pathologists the medical cause of death could not be ascertained.  The inquest, which lasted less than  minutes, heard it was believed the babyaposs body may have been left at the golf course at some time between December and January  or , when a groundskeeper at the course recalled seeing a bag on the ground. The Liverpool Echo reports the babyaposs remains were released for a funeral.Coroner Rebello said: The baby was buried rather than cremated in a case a relative comes forward in the future.  The funeral was held as a private service in May at Landican cemetery, Wirral. He said it was unknown whether the baby was born alive or stillborn. Detective Inspector Lynsay Armbruster said: “It has now been  months since the sad discovery of the baby’s body in Wirral. He has since been laid to rest but we would still urge his mother to come forward and speak to us.  “I hope that because some time has now passed she feels in a position to make herself known. We are not looking to attribute blame to anybody, we are simply trying to establish what happened and ensure that the mother has continued access to any vital health and social care support she may need. “I am sure that there are still people out there who know something but feel too scared or worried to come forward. I want them to feel reassured that the matter will be dealt with sensitively and all necessary help and support made available to those that need it.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON FuneralsInquests\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The shocked -year-old was alerted to the degrading and embarrassing violation of her privacy and has since been left suffering emotional trauma. The disgraceful and disrespectful filming had left long-lasting effects on her and it was one of the worst days of her le, Hull Crown Court heard. Kevin Syder, , from Hull, admitted recording images under the womanaposs clothes on March , . Richard Butters, prosecuting, said that Syder was detained by security staff at Primark in Princes Quay, Hull, after being alerted by a member of the public. The witness spotted him using a phone to take photographs up the skirt of a woman standing in front of him in the queue. The shopper told the woman: Excuse me, I have just seen this man taking a photograph up your skirt.  The woman was with her younger sister at the time. There were six videos showing the womanaposs bottom and underwear that had been filmed by Syder. He attempted to run out of the store but he was fortunately detained very quickly by security staff, said Mr Butters. He was arrested and his phone was seized. It has had a very long lasting, profound impact on his victim. The woman later said: I felt myself freeze. I felt shocked. It was extremely upsetting and shocking and I was crying. I donapost even recall what I was saying. I was so shocked about what had happened. I canapost remember exactly what I was shouting. I should be able to wear whatever I wish to and not have anybody taking a photographic image up my skirt. She told the court she felt violated that her shopping had been spoiled by this happening. I feel really numb and upset, she said. The woman said that she would have to carry the incident around with her and she would be on edge the next time she went into town, especially to Primark.  This crime has left long-lasting effects on myself and my family. I think about what happened to me every day, she said. Itaposs not just the physical act of what happened but the emotional trauma from a day that stays with you. I went through one of the worst things to happen. Itaposs degrading and embarrassing. I find myself reminded of what happened. I threw away any skirt or dress that came even slightly above the knee because I genuinely felt I didnapost have the confidence to wear them. I could barely concentrate on the work I had to do. That day was one of the worst days of my le. Julia Baggs, mitigating, said Syder wanted to apologise to the victim. This was clearly an impulsive and opportunist act, said Miss Baggs. This behaviour was completely irrational. He didnapost stop and think about the impact on the complainant. He does understand the seriousness of the offence and the damage that he has caused. He is deeply remorseful and sorry for his actions. He does feel deep shame and regret and this disgraceful and disrespectful act, to use his words. He is deeply sorry for this degrading and disgraceful piece of behaviour. Syder had no previous convictions and had worked as a plasterer before becoming a long-distance lorry driver for  years before losing that job because of this offence. He had served in the Territorial Army for more than  years, the court heard. He had been married but has no children. Judge Michael Fanning told Syder: Itaposs upskirting. Itaposs a crude, ugly word and it describes crude, ugly, perverse, disgusting conduct. I am well aware that the impact on victims is very, very real. He told him the woman was entitled to wear her own choice of clothes and to expect that some pervert is not going to stick a camera under her skirt for his own sexual gratication. She should not have to feel degraded, humiliated and violated, said Judge Fanning. This was very much targeted offending. You saw an opportunity. You saw and seized that opportunity. You recorded that victim under her clothing and that was for your sexual gratication. The real risk was that you shared it. Fortunately, you were caught on the day, the video was seized and that brings it to an end. Syder was given an -week suspended prison sentence, with rehabilitation work, and he was ordered to pay £ compensation to the woman. He must register as a sex offender for seven years and the phone will be forfeited and destroyed.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Primark Inc.Court caseCrown court\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Although the -year-old has been preparing for the “top job” for a long time, he will be “devastated” to take the throne from his mother, she says. The biographer told Podcast Royal: “This is a moment that he has been dreading all his le. By achieving the top job, the job he’s been training for and preparing for all these years does inevitably means the death of his mother and he loves his mother very dearly. “So it’s going to be a very vicious week, moment and I think that I am sure that he is pretty terried of the whole prospect.  He is a very emotional man and a sensitive man, he did take the death of his father very badly. He takes the death of any loved one to heart and I think it would be, it’s devastating for him as it is for anyone who loses a much-loved mother.”Last year, a poll found the public want the Crown to bypass Charles and go to Prince William when the Queen’s reign ends.Deltapoll interviewed , adults and found a generational ide over who should take the throne - with younger people even calling for rebel prince Harry to become king.  It was a blow to Prince Charles, after great strides to improve his public image over the past two decades. Royal commentator Jonathan Sacerdoti believes Charles will become the successor - but feels certain things will change. Charles is set to be a very dferent monarch to the Queen, he reckons. I certainly know that the monarchy will want to keep itself modern and agile in relation to the UK and the Commonwealth and keep itself relevant, Sacerdoti stated. Plenty of them absolutely love the Queen and the monarchy and that handover have already started with Prince Charles. I would imagine on their agenda is to keep their Commonwealth but it is inevitable over time that peopleaposs attitudes towards royalty and the monarchy might change and sht. I think thataposs why theyaposve been very careful to try to adapt and change with the times and Charles has also shown some indication that he might be quite the dferent monarch from his mother.

She was so incensed she had to later send out a message confirming ‘Clive is alive’.I’m not surprised she was furious. THIRTY POUNDS  I’d want a whole sheep and a field of turnips for that. Now I love a roast dinner more than most. Just thinking about tender meat soaking up gravy makes me drool. But come on, prices are getting ridiculous.I was going to wax lyrical about how mutton can taste just as delicious, and how scrag ends of meat in a stew contains the same goodness. I was tempted to suggest putting lesser cuts of meat in a big pie to make a substantial meal for half the price.  But then I stopped myself and thought: why, decades after our parents had rations, are we having to think this way  Why are we putting up with outrageous price rises on essentials  Why are honest, hardworking people punished in the pocket and at the dinner table  My dad always said, whenever the budget announcements were made, working people were hit hardest with the increased price of a pint and packet of cigarettes. Now it’s food. Thinking about it left me angrier than Clive’s we. Bittersweet time for Her Majesty Staying at Wood Farm cottage at Sandringham in the run up to the th anniversary of her father’s death next weekend will be extra emotional for the Queen as it’s the first time she’s been there without Prince Philip. I imagine it will feel comforting one moment, heartbreaking the next. The rooms, the gardens, the views and even the smells will remind her of the good times she’s had there, but the people she shared them with are gone. Loch Lomond is the special place where Colin and I enjoyed our special times. Each year I’d askhe’d like to have a holiday in Portugal or Loch Lomond, and he always chose Scotland. We loved everything about our trips there, from the long drive with our Motown music, Scotch eggs and tin of travel sweets. We’d always stop at Tebay services which has beautul scenery, turkey pie to die for and a farm shop.  We stayed in a cosy lodge, where even a cup of tea or a Chinese takeaway seemed to taste nicer. We’d walk in the wilderness for miles, spotting red deer, and we’d end up at little tea shops where it would have been rude not to order cake. Sometimes we’d drive to explore the surrounding areas and we’d get lost, in the days before sat nav, but somehow always found a warm, friendly pub. Colin loved the gentle pace and peace of our holidays there. And I adored how everything about the place made us both feel so relaxed and happy. I get a little tearful when Loch Lomond appears on television. Then I remind myself I was lucky to have had such fantastic times there.  Bloominapos solo birthday While Boris had a party for his birthday, I spent mine alone. My two sons bought me flowers and left them at the end of the drive because we wouldn’t have dreamt of breaking the social distance laws. I am too tired to be angry. Listening to all the political rows has left me weary and drained. Instead, I just wish all sides of the political spectrum would get their heads together and get our country up and running again.  Drama a real blast It can be hard to stay awake in January when it’s a long, grey, damp anticlimax. But an explosion scene in the new TV series Trigger Point made me jump out of my skin. My eyes popped so wide I felt more awake than I had in weeks.  Loo are you talking to  Fancy new research says lots of British phrases are no longer used because the younger generation are baffled by them. What a load of codswallop. Whoever did the survey needs to listen to my daily chat with my friend Beryl because we use such phrases constantly. I say this as a woman who still calls those sweets Opal Fruits and will never say Starburst. So here’s my guide to those sayings which have got young people’s knickers in a twist. Flogging a dead horse means there’s no point in arguing any more - that’s what I say whenever I’m giving our Robert a talking-to because he never he pays any notice. I’m fit for the knacker’s yard means every bit of me is falling to pieces and no use to anyone, which is how I describe myself these days.  Dropping a clanger is a less posh way of saying committing a faux pas - something my friends say I do every day. No wonder no one understands that ‘spend a penny’ means going to the loo because they usually cost a pound now. And a dog’s dinner is what I create each time I try cooking. But I have no idea where ‘daft as a brush’ comes from - or why my friends use it whenever they talk about me. Bobsleigh, the coolest sport The Australian Open tennis has turned my body clock upside down because I’m glued to the coverage. Soon I’ll be riveted by the Beijing Olympic Winter Games. The bobsleigh is my favourite. Me and my friend Janet reckonwe could get in one we’d shoot down faster than anyone . But we’d laugh so hysterically there’d need to be room in my skin-tight race suit for a Tena Lady.If you’d like to write to Val, please email features@mirror or write to Val Savage, PO Box , E DD The Mirror makes a donation to the Alzheimer’s Society in lieu of payment. alzheimersRead MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Novak DjokovicPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghRobbie SavageAustralian OpenWinter Olympic GamesRoyal FamilyMental healthPrice risesAlzheimers diseaseBobsledDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ulidia Integrated College in Co Antrim, Northern Ireland, has defended its strict toilet policy where the loos operate as a one-in one-out policy at break and lunchtimes.Requests to use the loo during class time will be refused unless the pupil shows a medical card or exemption to the teacher, parents were informed via email.Furthermore, pupils who need to use the toilet outside the specied times during their period will need a note from their parents, which will then be dated and counter-signed by their form teacher, BelfastLive reports.  The school said it has been dealing with ious issues amongst an increasing number of Year  pupils, which included disrespecting staff, misuse of toilets, unorm breaches, Covid- breaches, and vandalism. The school has said that from January  it was implementing a zero-tolerance approach.One parent Ciaran McCauley told BBC Radio Ulsteraposs Evening Extra on Thursday: My son is in Year  at the school and he came home on Friday last and was quite concerned because he had become aware of the email that had gone out to the parents of Year  students.It doesnapost affect my son directly but he was able to empathise with the issues that might be impacting the other students.  He complained that the toilets were being locked and students and parents had been asked to supply notes. If the children needed to access toiletsthey were on their period, they had to bring a note in, have it counter-signed by a teacher and dated. Ciaran believes itaposs an unfair policy and wrong. He added: I thought it was regressive and led to embarrassing situations for kids. Unfortunately, we live in a society where periods still have a stigma attached to them and theyaposre still an embarrassment for many.  Ciaran initially thought the email was a rumour, but when he contacted the school they confirmed it. In a statement, principal Michael Houston said: As a rights respecting school, Ulidia Integrated College is in full support of the Period Dignity Project, which refers to the accessibility and availability of essential care needed to support a period in conjunction with the removal and breaking of stigma and taboo around periods. Education is a key factor in breaking the stigma surrounding periods and promoting respect, understanding and open discussions about what people may experience. Following repeated incidents of vandalism and breaches of Covid- safeguards in the toilets, many of which occurred during lesson times, some facilities had to be closed, replaced or repaired. We want to ensure that all pupils in the particular year group affected are always given access to clean and sanitary facilities during their period. Mr Houston added that the measures are temporary and protective, only relevant for the pupils in a single year group who have to leave during lessons as facilities are freely available before school, at break and lunch time, end of day and between lessons as required. He added: In addition all single person all access toilets are open too all pupils all day every day without exception. It comes two months after a Co Down grammar school was criticised for its toilet policy after it emerged there were just three toilets for , pupils.The rules about going to the toilet imposed at Glenlola Collegiate School in Bangor were labelled “draconian”.Thehas contacted the school for a comment.

Yellow weather warnings are in place across all of Scotland, northern England and parts of Northern Ireland for most of Saturday as Storm Malik moves in from the north east bringing the wind and rain.But there is a more severe amber warning for eastern Scotland, where damaging gusts of wind will likely cause disruption to road, rail, air and ferry services. Power supplies and mobile phone coverage could also be affected.  The Met Office warned: Injuries and danger to le could occur from flying debris as well as from large waves and beach material being thrown onto sea fronts, coastal roads and properties.And Met Office forecaster Luke Miall said of the winds:Widely  to  but we could see ,  and even mph gusts especially towards the North East so we do have an amber warning in place across north eastern Scotland, that’s damaging gusts of wind that could cause some signicant disruption.”He added:We also have this sequence of rain bringing some very wet weather as well for a time. SP Energy Networks, the company responsible for electricity transmission in central and southern Scotland, issued safety advice around potential power cuts.  The company said customers should keep a battery or wind-up torch to hand and keep mobile phones fully charged. People should also beware of fallen power lines, it said. Network Rail Scotland said it would introduce some speed restrictions for safety, and have additional staff equipped with chainsaws across the network to deal with fallen trees on tracks. Named by the Danish Meteorological Institute, Storm Malik is expected to bring in gusts reaching up to mph in coastal areas, but more widely mph, as it tracks eastwards towards Denmark.  Paul Gunderson, chief meteorologist for the Met Office, said: The impacts of Storm Malik are going to be greatest in Denmark on Sunday, but the track of the storm in the preceding hours means that the UK will be dealt a glancing blow as Malik moves eastwards on Saturday. For those in the north of the UK there will be high winds and rain on Saturday, with showers possibly turning wintry in the high ground in the north. The highest winds are expected in exposed coastal areas in the north and east of Scotland, but it will be a windy day for most. Further south, the weekend weather will feature some blustery winds and some rain.  The storm will also drive a cold front southwards, with temperatures set to come down throughout Saturday and widespread frost expected to form across the UK in the night into Sunday. More very strong winds are expected as another low pressure system moves across northern areas on Sunday, with some snow possible across parts of Scotland. It is out towards Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland that we will see the increasingly windy weather, starting to develop, said Mr Miall. Some hill snow for Scotland, we are keeping a close eye on that. Another yellow warning for wind is in place for the northern UK from pm on Sunday until noon on Monday. UK forecast for the next  days Today: Very windy Scotland and north England with rain in northwest moving south and easing. Brighter skies with some showers following. Cloudy and mild most of England and Wales with drizzle in west. Clearer skies arriving from north during afternoon. Tonight: Winds easing overnight with good clear spells developing leading to a widespread frost. Showers in the northeast slowly dying out. Sunday: Cold, bright start for many but becoming cloudier. Rain and strong winds developing in north with very strong winds for west and south Scotland and some snow for north Scotland. Outlook for Monday to Wednesday: Very windy start to Monday, with rain clearing to showers, these wintry in the north. Milder, though often blustery for Tuesday and Wednesday. Some persistent rain for the northwest.

The kitchen is fitted with handmade oak units arranged around an island unit and is naturally illuminated by a large roof light.  An elegant hexagonal conservatory is set to the southern corner of the house and views of the garden to the rear. The first floor consists of elegant and spacious bedroom suites.

The report is expected to be sent to No in the coming hours or days after Ms Gray handed over evidence of possible lockdown breaches to Scotland Yard.No will then decide when to publish it, with the government previously suggesting this would happen when Parliament is sitting - which is next on Monday.  However, the report is set to follow the Met Police request to include only “minimal reference” to Downing Street parties the force is investigating. It is unclearor when a fuller report with all the details will be published, after the Met finishes its investigation. The politan Police asked the top civil servant to make minimal references to the parties it is investigating in her report to avoid prejudicing its inquiry. Scotland Yard is looking at a number of events in Downing Street and Whitehall during the pandemic - but the force has not specied which ones.Reports have suggested it could be as many as eight gatherings. At the same time, Sue Grayaposs report had been expected this week but the timing has been thrown into chaos by the Metaposs bombshell announcement of a police probe on Tuesday. The Whitehall inquiry is understood to be still ongoing but Ms Gray may be forced to decide whether to delay her report or strip out key details. Opposition MPs blasted the appearance of an establishment stitch-up and a Whitehall whitewash, which could buy Boris Johnson a reprieve.The Prime Minister will spend the weekend at his Chequers retreat as he seeks to shore up his battered leadership. In a statement on Friday, Scotland Yard said: For the events the Met is investigating, we asked for minimal reference to be made in the Cabinet Office report. The Met did not ask for any limitations on other events in the report, or for the report to be delayed, but we have had ongoing contact with the Cabinet Office, including on the content of the report, to avoid any prejudice to our investigation. However some legal figures questioned why publishing the Whitehall report would prejudice the police investigation.

Met Office says road, rail, air and ferry services are likely to be affected, leading to longer journey times and some cancellations. Some roads and bridges likely to close too.There is also a good chance power cuts may occur, with the potential to affect other services, such as mobile phone coverage, forecasters say. The storm will slowly move south, asdetails, and will impact the East Midlands and East of England by Monday evening. Storm Corrie will, meanwhile, bring a new spell of rainfall and gusts across Scotland in the middle of the week.  Today The amber weather warning is in place for eastern Scotland and northeast England throughout today. Met Office said: An area of very strong west or northwest winds will cross Scotland and notheast England on Saturday morning in association with Storm Malik before easing during the afternoon. The strongest winds are expected in the east of Scotland and northeast of England later in the morning. Gusts of widely - mph are likely with a short period of gusts in excess of  mph possible, particularly for Moray and north Aberdeenshire as well as the Lothians.  The amber warning covers central Scotland, Tayside  Fe, Grampian, southwest Scotland and the Lothian Borders. North East England is also covered, including Newcastle and Northumberland. A yellow weather warning is in place for all of Scotland, much of Northern Ireland and parts of northern England today for wind too. Met Office added: An area of strong winds will cross Scotland, parts of Northern Ireland and some northern counties of England on Saturday morning before easing during the afternoon. Gusts of widely - mph are expected and there is a chance of a brief period of gusts in excess of  mph in places, particularly for parts of eastern Scotland later in the morning.  Met Officeaposs chief meteorologist Paul Gundersen said: “The impacts of Storm Malik are going to be greatest in Denmark on Sunday, but the track of the storm in the preceding hours means that the UK will be dealt a glancing blow as Malik moves eastwards on Saturday. “For those in the north of the UK there will be high winds and rain on Saturday, with showers possibly turning wintry in the high ground in the north. The highest winds are expected in exposed coastal areas in the north and east of Scotland, but it will be a windy day for most.” Sunday The yellow weather warning remains in place throughout Sunday for all of Scotland, most of northeast England, northwest England and parts of Northern Ireland and north Wales. Travel disruption is likely in these spots, and the weather will generate some large and dangerous waves around the coasts. Met Office said road, rail, air and ferry services may be affected, with longer journey times and cancellations possible.  Injuries and danger to le could occur from large waves and beach material being thrown onto susceptible sea fronts, coastal roads and properties, forecasters added. Gusts could reach up to mph in hilly and coastal areas, including along the North Sea shore. Met Office continued: On Sunday evening a spell of strong northwesterly winds is likely to develop across western Scotland, and then progress southeastwards eventually easing away from the North Sea coastlines during Monday morning. The strongest wind gusts will mostly occur around the coastlines and over the hills. Monday Sundayaposs yellow weather warning - and the areas subject to it - will remain throughout Monday too. Met Office said: Thereaposs a small chance that a very limited part of the area could see a short period of more damaging gusts, that could reach -mph inland, and -mph around exposed coasts and hills. Temperatures will remain in single figures on Monday. Agostinho Sousa, a consultant in public health medicine, has urged Britons to remind elderly neighbours to heat their homes. “Cold weather can have a serious impact on health, particularly for older people and those with heart and lung problems, as it increases the risks of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections. “Remind vulnerable relatives and neighbours to heat their home to at least C – particularlythey have reduced mobility, are  or older, or have a health condition. “Should they need to go outside, it’s important for them to wear shoes with a good grip.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Met OfficeWeatherWeather warning\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Nicolette Baker was diagnosed with Superior Mesenteric Artery syndromenearly a decade ago - a condition which means that her Superior Mesenteric artery is compressing on her duodenum and kidney -causing her unimaginable pain when she tries to eat.A -year-old says eating something as small as a jelly baby feels like sheaposs aposfinished off a Christmas dinner apos and makes her intestine feel like itaposs aposgoing to burstapos.Over the years she had been misdiagnosed as anorexic and even force-fed, as her weight has dwindled to a terrying st. In March last year doctors told her she had aposdays to liveapos, meaning they would only offer her palliative care.  But defiant Nicolette wants to live and has already raised £, towards £, for surgery in Germany to relieve the pressure and pain her artery is causing. Nicolette said: The surgery is booked but I need to pay for the weeks Iaposll be spending in intensive care afterwards because my health is so poor. There’s only two weeks to go I’m really determined to keep going. I used to thinkI’m going to die I’m going to die but things have changed. Now I’ve actually been told I’m dying I don’t just want to surrender to that, I want to live and give something back to society.After being given days to live Nicolette became determined to defy doctorsapos predictions and earlier this month set up a GoFundMe where she opened up about how she is aposliterally starving to deathapos. Although Nicolette only received her diagnosis seven years ago, doctors believe she was born with the condition. Nicolette can recall having issues with her digestive system from as young as four years old, but it wasnapost until her late s that she would understand what was happening to her. She said: Eating a jelly baby feels like I’ve finished off a full Christmas dinner. As that jelly baby passes through my intestine the pain is incredible. It feels like a hose pipe with a blockage in it to the point where it is going to burst. She added: I remember throwing up liquid milk at four years old. I was just labelled as anorexic but when I eat it causes me so much pain.  The less I ate the less pain I’d have so I ended up losing quite a bit of weight and it was deemed to be a mental health problem.I was an inpatient at hospitals for years and I was force fed which only made the problem worse and caused me even more pain.The condition has completely robbed Nicolette of her le - she has been unable to start a family, have a career and was even forced to give up her beloved -year-old whippet, Eden. She said: I have always dreamed of my prince charming coming on a white horse but I don’t think that will happen. I had to give up my beloved dog because I couldn’t manage him anymore. The first thing I will do when Iaposve had the surgery is get him back. Before her health declined, Nicolette had worked part time in a hospice, until she could no longer even manage that - meaning she has no savings of her own to fall back on.  Now, as the condition holds her on the brink of death, it is a race against time to raise the final £, needed so she has secured her follow up treatment after her surgery on February . She said It would mean everything to raise the last £, I need so I donapost have that pressure hanging over me. Iaposm struggling with my breathing, my whole system is shutting down one by one. Iaposm desperate to make it through just so I can thank all the people who have so generously helped me get to this point. Nicolette will fly out on February  for preliminary scans ahead of the surgery at the end of the month.

Thereaposs no aposdoomsday asteroidapos hurtling towards us imminently that we know of but astronomers check regularly just in case. Nasaaposs Jet Propulsion Laboratoryuses a special software to analysepossibly hazardous asteroids could hit Earth. And now the agency is upgrading the software for the first time in  years with a new Sentry-II algorithm. It works by frequently scanning a list of asteroids and their orbits that are already known to be possibly hazardous and then calculatesany known or new asteroids could potentially hit Earth.  The system being used is known as the Yarkovsky effect, referring to how an asteroid absorbs sunlight and emits it as heat.This heat impacts the asteroidaposs path and can be the possibility of it hitting Earth, , reports the Sun.Sentry, the original software, was previously unable to do this.  Scientists had to previously do manual calculations to work out the Yarkovsky effect so the software upgrade will make a massive dference. Nasa keeps an eye on almost , near-Earth asteroids currently, and itaposs hoped the software upgrade will help them see more. Thousands of new asteroids can be discovered each year. And in , the agency is aiming to launch its Near Earth ObjectSurveyor mission so it will have a spacecraft focused solely on hunting for asteroids. Itaposs expected the spacecraft could find  per cent of asteroids  feet or bigger inin the first  years after launching.

Daniel and Lacey Rawlings were given  months of supervised probation without jail time in their sentencing on Thursday. In a Colorado court, Judge Timothy Wright sentenced Daniel to  months of probation and , hours of community service, while Lacey received  months of supervised probation and  hours of community service.The horror incident happened on November  of , after a period of heavy rain in the area north of Phoenix,People reported.The Bar X Crossing at Tonto Creek had flooded and authorities had placed a barricade to turn vehicles away from the area. Daniel was driving the military-style vehicle, with seven children in the back.  Authorities alleged that he drove the vehicle around the barricade and through the creek - a journey he had made several times earlier that day. However, this time the vehicle was swept up in the rushing water. The parents and four of the children were rescued by helicopter, but the three other children did not survive. The bodies of the coupleaposs -year-old son, Colby, and the boyaposs cousin, -year-old Austin, were recovered the following morning, while the body of Colby’s sister, -year-old Willa, was found two weeks later on the edge of the lake, several miles away. Both Daniel and Lacey were each initially charged with seven counts of child abuse.  Daniel, who was behind the wheel of the vehicle, was also charged with three counts of involuntary manslaughter. In December, Daniel entered a guilty plea to three counts of manslaughter and seven counts of child abuse. Meanwhile, Lacey pleaded guilty to one count of child abuse. Speaking in court on Thursday afternoon, Lacey described the incident as a “mistake [she agonizes] over every minute”.  “I will continue to agonize over it for the rest of my le, she said. Iaposm so sorry. Lacey went on to describe her surviving children as being her “world”. My kids are the reason I get out of bed every single day. My kids are the reason I found a way to move on. They deserve a happy le. They deserve a mother who tries her absolute hardest to give them everything they need. Daniel took the stand next to read a prepared statement.  I wish every day that I could go back and relive and redo the events of that horric day, he said. I wish I could take that trauma and carry it myself. I wish I could take everybodyaposs pain and bottle it up and hold it myself because nobody deserves to endure pain that I have caused them. While many family members spoke on the couple’s behalf, at least one relative urged the judge not to be too lenient. Austin’s grandmother, Lynn Morey, told the judge she still has nightmares about the incident. Cutting corners when it comes to childrenaposs safety is a deal-breaker,” she said. Thanksgiving has never been the same since. That feeling of dread lingers throughout the weekend, overshadowing everything our family does, despite our attempts to live through this, be grateful and move on. The coupleaposs probation begins immediately.

But thanks to a tip from a driving school TikTok account named Driving Test Success @drivingtestsuccess, we no longer need to suffer in the freezing cold before we head to work, as it turns out you can actually get rid of the ice from inside your car as itaposs warming up. Experts at Driving Test Success say you can clear ice cover by simply activating your car windscreen fan, which will heat up the glass from the inside and help to melt the frost, the Express reports. In the companyaposs video, they explained: “Frozen windscreen  Put the temperature on high.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. “Put the front windscreen fan on max. The ice will start to melt from the heat. Wipe away excess water andthe fan to normal. While the tip might seem obvious to some seasoned drivers, several commenters on the video who were new to driving couldnapost believe theyaposd never seen the hack before. One commenter said: Wow, magic! The ice is gone. And another praised the account for all their help, as they wrote: Iaposve learnt so much thanks to your app!  But others were less impressed, as one TikTok user shunned the idea, stating: Wastes more fuel. Just get [out] and scrape it off you lazy so and so.” Driving Test Success is far from the first account to point out the easy de-icing trick either, as another video online from Clear View Driving said road users should use their demister before they start driving. They said: “Now donapost use your windscreen wipers or washers as that wonapost help. Turn on your front and rear demister. “The rear demister also heats up your side mirrors in most new cars. Butthe mirrors are not clear, make sure to clear them before you start driving. “Then, once itaposs done you can use your wipers.” And in the cold winter months, the AA has also encouraged road users to “turn on the warm air blower” and “heated mirrors” to clear frost cover quickly and safely.They explained: “Start the engine and turn on the warm air blower on the windscreen. Switch on the rear windscreen heater and heated mirrors,you have them. Turn on the air-con. Itaposs not just for summer – itaposll remove moisture from the air to stop the car from misting up. “Don’t use your hands to wipe misted-up windows – youaposll leave greasy smears and a diamond ring could scratch the glass. Use a lint-free absorbent clothnecessary. “Stay with your car the whole time while the engineaposs running.” What do you think is the best way to de-ice your car  Let us know in the comments below.

No matter how hard you try, those whites always end up looking grey. However, one TikTok trend doing the rounds on social media promises to have your whites looking bright, and the best bit is, itaposll only set you back a few pence. The hack was shared by one user, @burcibaci, who revealed the one simple and cheap item you need to add to your wash to ensure those whites stay white - washing up liquid.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. All you need to do is add a small amount of washing up liquid to a small cap, before throwing it in the washer with your white load, although the TikToker recommends you do this in addition to your washing detergent, rather than in its place. aposaposI would also add your detergent too for the best clean, she wrote alongside the clip, which has since been viewed more than , times. Although she used a pale coloured Fairy Liquid, other TikTok users recommended blue soaps as they can be used to cancel out the yellow tones in the white materials. Many people questioned how the bubbles from the soap didnapost overflow, but @burcibaci simply explained that you only have to use a very small amount for it to be effective. It also makes a great stain remover! One part dawn dish soap, one part hydrogen peroxide, one helpful TikToker commented.

She added that some head teachers would also be expected to retire within the transition period.#Job sizing will be criticalthe proposals are to be implemented,# Ms Connor said.Council documents explain that the process of job sizing takes into account the size of schools, leadership roles and teaching time when deciding on the salary scale for promoted posts in education.#Head teachers retiring would also form part of the modelling,# Ms Connor added. #If a school collective was agreed where there were, for example, seven head teachers then two might be retiring and that would form part of the model.#Until collectives are looked at in more detail we can#t have a clear idea of staff numbers.#As part of the consultation process, which started in November and is due to finish on March , the council has shared its proposals with parent groups and community councils.Feedback from the consultation is timetabled to be presented to Argyll and Bute Council in April.This will be followed by the proposals being voted on towards the end of  and,approved, interim processes to bring in the changes would begin in spring .At Tuesday#s meeting it was explained, however, that the consultation will continue throughout the process with pupils, parents and educators being included in the process throughout.In addition, dialogue is continuing with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Argyll and the Isles concerning the involvement of faith schools in school collectives.These discussions were described by council officers as #ongoing# and #collaborative#.Concerns were also raised about the timing of the proposed changes, coming when pupils# education and wellbeing had been impacted by the pandemic.Acting Head of Education Learning and Teaching Wendy Brownlie said: #Young people#s views have been gathered throughout and they have expressed really interesting points both for and against the changes.#The consultation paper addresses the issue of the pandemic by saying: #The last couple of years have been extraordinarily challenging for schools.

And now. after two years they have recruited over  participants from  sites across the UK.Prior to the launch of MND-SMART, only three of the sites had run clinical trials in MND in the last decade.MND-SMART is designed to test more than one drug at the same time and be adaptive so that researchers can mody their approach according to emerging results. The trial has so far been testing two active drugs and more drugs will be added, in due course, while medicines that prove ineffective will be dropped.Dr Suvankar Pal, Euan MacDonald Centre for MND Research, University of Edinburgh and Co-lead Investigator of MND-SMART, said, “Historically, you would have a two-armed trial that looks at one active drug against a placebo [dummy drug], but this trial design allows us to test many, many more active drugs simultaneously and therefore get a definitive answer [phase ] more quickly, which is a much more efficient way of doing things.”Doddie’s Foundation has a clear vision of a world free of motor neuron disease and was founded in response to his frustration at the lack of options given to MND patients – no effective treatment, no access to meaningful clinical trials and no hope.The aims of the Foundation are to raise funds to aid research into the causes of MND and investigate potential cures and to make grants to iniduals suffering from MND, to enable them to live as fulfilled a le as possible.Olivia Bird, Research and Grants Officer at My Name’ Doddie Foundation, said, “We are delighted to continue our involvement in this landmark trial in MND and it is brilliant to see what progress has been made, despite the challenges of working around a pandemic.“We are incredibly grateful to the trial teams across the UK who have shown commitment and enthusiasm to get the trial up and running, and to our supporters who have gone to extraordinary s to raise much needed funds.”.removeA £, grant was also awarded to Newcastle NHS Foundation Trust to facilitate recruitment of patients in the northeast of England."},{"url":null,"title":"highway-code-changes-make-roads-safer-says-cycling-scotland","story":"CHANGES to the Highway Code have been welcomed by Cycling Scotland, the nation’s cycling organisation.The changes come into effect today and will impact all road users but will have the overall goal of making roads safer for people on foot, bikes and horses.Around , people took part in a consultation, with the UK government saying that most people who responded were in favour of the proposed changes.The change in rules will see users who are most at risk moved to the top of the hierarchy and enforces the idea that motorists need to be more aware of cyclists, and cyclists need to be more aware of pedestrians.Among the many changes, cyclists are advised to ride in the centre of a lane on quieter roads, in slower-moving traffic, and when approaching junctions to make themselves as visible as possible.They can ride two abreast, as is already the case but must allow drivers behind them to overtakeit is safe to do so.Other key amendments include clearer guidance for drivers to leave a distance of at least . metres when overtaking cyclists, and there will also be a recommendation for car occupants to open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder behind them.This technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opening into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists.Drivers and motorcyclists should now give priority to cyclists on roundabouts. The guidance will say they should not attempt to overtake people cycling within that person’s lane and should allow people cycling to move across their path as they travel around the roundabout.Cyclists will still be able to remain in the left-hand lane when going across or around a roundabout. The new guidance is due that will tell motorists to pay extra attention to this, taking care not to cut off cyclists doing this.Christopher Johnson, Head of Education and Training, Cycling Scotland said: “We welcome the updates to the Highway Code as one of many actions needed to prevent people being seriously injured and killed on our roads in Scotland..remove“The new hierarchy of road users underpins the changes - those who can cause the greatest harm have the greatest responsibility to reduce the risk to others: people driving will be responsible for ensuring people cycling, walking and wheeling are safe, while people cycling will be responsible for looking out for those walking and wheeling.“Many of the changes to the Highway Code are not new but are clarying or explaining existing rules. We encourage everyone to read the new guidance and follow it, whether you’re walking or wheeling, riding a bike or horse or driving a vehicle.“While good progress has been on road safety overall in the last decade, sadly still too many people are killed or seriously injured while walking or cycling”All road users are urged to study the new rules."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-mps-david-mundell-john-lamont-expenses-revealed","story":"THE two Borders MPs cost the taxpayer around £, last year, new figures reveal.Data on business and staffing costs for the financial year   has been published by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority .And the figures show that Tweeddale representative David Mundell was the fourth most expensive MP in the UK, claiming £,. – up from £,. last year.Mr Mundell, of the Conservatives, spent around £, on staff wages, approximately £, on rent, and around £, on advertising and contact cards, according to the data.Meanwhile, he paid out more than £, on air travel, around £, on stationery and printing, and approximately £, on a working from home allowance.:Fears that new supermarket would hurt Galashiels laughable, says councillorIn response to the figures, Mr Mundell said: “The constituency I represent is one of the largest and most erse in the whole United Kingdom, stretching from the Scottish border to the Pentland Hills south of Edinburgh, and covering three separate council areas and three separate NHS health boards.“I try at all times to provide the best possible service to my constituents across the more than  inidual communities which make up my constituency and this necessarily involves a level of expenditure that other MPs, representing smaller, less complex constituencies, are not required to incur.”The Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale MP added: “COVID has made this all the more challenging, including expenditure on local newspaper advertising to help ensure constituents and businesses who have queries about how COVID regulations impact them, or how grants or other forms of support can be accessed, had my office contact details easily to hand.”:Police tasked to target inappropriate and dangerous parking in Borders townAccording to the IPSA data, the average cost of an MP in the UK was £,..removeThe figures show that fellow Westminster representative for the region John Lamont claimed £,. in  .Mr Lamont’s largest type of cost was around £, on staff wages, followed by £, on rent and £, on bought-in services.Meanwhile, the Conservative MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk spent approximately £, on advertising and contact cards, just under £, on air travel and around £, on a working from home allowance.Mr Lamont’s costs were up on the £,. recorded the year before.:Police appeal for information following reports of graffiti in SelkirkOn the data, he said: “During the last year, we have seen an unprecedented  per cent increase in the number of enquiries and requests for help from local residents.

honour the traditional Scots dish with a rendition of one of Robert Burns’ most famous and oft-performed poems: Address To a Haggis.Usually recited by the dinners host, the tongue-in-cheek address has been a long-established focal point of the Burns Supper, a night which celebrates the birth date of the literary legend himself: January , .After the haggis is piped to the table , Burns’ words are recited over the dish as it is cut open and served to the guests.Some say it is wise to cut a small incision in the side of the haggis before it is properly \"cut open\" on the table - tales of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.What is the history of an Address to a Haggis The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , ..removeA quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Address to a Haggis by Robert Burns, in FullFair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labourdight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeonhas given give her weekly Covid update in parliament today.The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iantwere removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

We also continue to work hard on ious other initiatives to allow us to match capacity to patient demand as far as we possibly can.“We work together with our colleagues in the CWIC [Care When It Counts] team to see as many patients as we can each day.“However, we and ELHSCP – which runs the CWIC service – have both noted that we believe each of our teams are already working at capacity, in terms of the volume of healthcare they are able to deliver.“We have consistently offered access to our data and remain eager to work with all relevant parties to try and bring about a solution for our patients.”An ELHSCP spokesperson said: “Riverside Medical Practice, East Lothian Health  Social Care Partnership and NHS Lothian the Primary Care Contracts Organisationand Lothian LMCmet on December . All agreed that continuing issues with access to primary care in Musselburgh are distressing and agreed a commitment to working collaboratively to explore potential solutions.“Riverside Medical Practice and ELHSCP both noted that they believed each of their teams were already working at capacity in terms of the volume of healthcare they were able to deliver.“Following the meeting with the Cabinet Secretary, we have agreed to discuss options with the practice and meet again in the coming weeks.“We look forward to providing an update on this important issue after our next meeting.”"},{"url":null,"title":"drivers-urged-stick-restrictions-outside-primary-schools","story":"Motorists are not allowed to travel down a trio of streets at certain times of the day during the school term.The restrictions were introduced on Neilson Park Road, Victoria Road and Wemyss Place by East Lothian Council in  in a bid to help keep youngsters safe on the roads.Community police officers and East Lothian Council have repeatedly raised awareness of the restrictions, which are in place .-.am and -pm Monday to Thursday.On Fridays, vehicles are banned .-.am and .am-.pm.: Subscribe to the East Lothian Courier for FREE... but offer ends on Monday!Pop-up reminders are also in place on the streets.Stuart Pe-Win, a member of Haddington’s community council, felt that there was still work to do to educate drivers."},{"url":null,"title":"former-scotland-international-tim-visser-haddington-weekend-rugby-match","story":"East Lothian and Haddington Barbarians Vets will welcome Wooden Spoon Vets, coached by Tim Visser.The match, which takes place at the Neilson Park home of Haddington RFC, kicks off at .pm.Entry for the match is free of charge and evening entertainment will be provided as a Burns supper, courtesy of the town’s rugby club.

address has been a long-established focal point of the Burns Supper, a night which celebrates the birth date of the literary legend himself: January , .After the haggis is piped to the table , Burns’ words are recited over the dish as it is cut open and served to the guests.Some say it is wise to cut a small incision in the side of the haggis before it is properly \"cut open\" on the table - tales of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , .A quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Fair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labour dight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iant were removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

and pedestrians risk failing to boost safety due to not being widely promoted, campaigners have warned.Charity Cycling UK said that a “long-term and well-funded communications campaign” is needed to make people aware of the update.The Highway Code, which contains advice and rules for people on Britain’s roads, is being amended this weekend to introduce a risk-based hierarchy of road users.Here’s everything you need to know about what’s new as the rules of the roads receive an update.Hierarchy of road usersA new hierarchy means people in charge of vehicles that can cause the most harm in the event of a collision have the greatest responsibility to look out for other road users.Walking, cycling or riding in shared spacesCyclists should not overtake people walking or riding a horse in shared spaces closely or at high speed, while pedestrians should take care not to obstruct paths.Positioning of cyclistsCyclists should make themselves as visible as possible by riding in the centre of lanes on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions.Pedestrians crossing at junctionsTurning traffic should give way when people are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions.Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings.Overtaking cyclistsDrivers travelling at speeds of up to mph should leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists.They should give more space when overtaking at higher speeds.Opening car doorsCar occupants should open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder.This technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opened into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists.Overtaking cyclists at junctionsWhen cyclists are going straight ahead at a junction, they have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise.Cycling in groupsPeople cycling can ride two abreast but should be considerate of the needs of other road users when in groups.RoundaboutsDrivers should take extra care when entering roundabouts to make sure they do not cut across cyclists.Electric vehicle chargingElectric car owners using a public chargepoint should park near the device and avoid creating a trip hazard from trailing

Sometimes it is a happy thing because they are moving house and clearing everything out.\"It is something that no matter who you are, you can relate to, because at some point in all of our lives we are going to have to do that, whether it is for a grandparent, a parent or when we get to the stage in le where we are downsizing.\"Antiques expert and auctioneer Angus Ashworth presents Clear Out, Cash In. Picture: STV Studios Ashworth, who also presents The Yorkshire Auction House on Really, has a magpie-like fascination for unusual objects, making his line of work the perfect vocation.\"I absolutely love my job because no two days are the same,\" he attests. \"I couldnt sit at a desk. Every day I am out meeting dferent people and seeing dferent houses. You see the full spectrum – right up to stately homes.\"Every day is dferent. You never know what you are going to find next. There is that little bit of a treasure hunter where you go into a house, spot something and think: Wow, that is special.\"That is the joy of it. I love history and some of these items tell fantastic stories. They might not be hugely valuable, but an item can tell a wonderful story.\"There has been no shortage of gems so far on Clear Out, Cash In. \"We have seen a range of items from a house full of Ferrari memorabilia to one filled with Beatrix Potter figurines, as well as amazing artworks and even a boat,\" says Ashworth.A collection of Beatrix Potter figurines are among the items featured on new STV series Clear Out, Cash In.

When you are dealing with a house clearance, it can be quite sad at times, but it is often the start of a new chapter.\"A common mistake people make, he says, is assuming that because an item has been around for a long while, it will fetch a pretty penny under the hammer. Yet, by the same token, many of us can overlook the potential value of modern everyday objects.\"The horror stories I hear about people who have thrown good things out,\" he says. \"The misconception is that because something is old, it is valuable and that is not the case. Just because something is antique, it doesnt mean it has got a value.\"Modern stuff,it is the right look and the right piece, that is what will sell. A lot nowadays is about the look.

Whats that : Have you got a hidden fortune in the loft  Here’s what to look for …\"Other times you walk in and bang, straightaway, you think wow. I have just been at one today and it was like stepping back to the s. Everything is as it was.\"Ashworth, , fell in love with antiques from an early age. \"My parents are into antiques and my uncle was in the antiques business,\" he says. \"It was always around me. As a young lad, ,  and , I used to go to auctions and collected militaria – that was my interest.\"That came from watching Sharpe and reading the Bernard Cornwell series of books when I was a youngster. I started collecting powder flasks – before you had bullets, there was this little flask that held the powder.\"Antiques expert and auctioneer Angus Ashworth on an episode of Celebrity Antiques Road Trip.

I think that came from his love of Scotland.\"I was in the reserve forces and got called up. I did Iraq and Afghanistan. Then  years ago I set up my own auction house, and it has gone from there.\"Ask Ashworth about the most memorable moments from his adventures in antiques and he has no shortage of engaging anecdotes.: Have you got a hidden fortune in the loft  Here’s what to look for …\"We recently did a sale after an antiques dealer died. The family asked us to sell his entire stock and collection. Most sales you might have  to  people selling items. That was an incredible two-day sale for one persons estate.\"It was our second-highest grossing sale of all-time. When it is a good sale, you get lots of people emailing enquiries, the internet is on fire – we had bidders from  countries on that sale – and you get that buzz.\"There have been a few big hits. There was a little Lowry sketch that made £,. We sold a Purdey shotgun for £,.

It travels at kph and has been praised for helping fix potholes more speedily resulting in less disruption for motorists and helping traffic flow.Glasgow City Council, which has thousands of reports of potholes every year and faces multi-million repairs, hopes the vehicle will help keep streets smoother. A council spokesman said: “We are taking delivery of new a vehicle that we will be testing out on road repairs over a six month period, starting late February.He said it will mainly be used as a “planer that lts damaged road surface before new asphalt is laid.”Read more: Glasgow concert hall steps: What do you want to see in their place Pointing out its smaller size was useful for limited spaces he added: “We will be using the vehicle to deal with areas of less than  metres squared and it can support our basic aim of completing high quality repairs to the road surface at the first time of asking without having to repeat any work.“The vehicle should also be able to move quickly between jobs and so we are keen to see the machine in action to get a better idea of how effective it might be as part of our road repairs programme.”The Multihog patch planer enables road surfaces to be planed to a width of mm and a depth of mm and saves on the costs of infill materials by accurately removing only what is necessary. It produces a sound base for reinstatement and helps to reduce transport and recycling costs by creating a re-usable material.The local authority is responsible for a road network of , km to maintain. However with new machine a five man team could now reinstate between  and  m² a day, making it at least four times more productive.The council will be using the Multihog tractor with a planer attachment. It can be converted for use as a gritter or saline solution spreader to treat roads in winter.Last year it was revealed that a one-off investment of £m is required to bring the roads up to a “good standard”.The figure was emailed to councillors who had asked how much it would cost to fix all of the citys potholes.Cities across Scotland have a backlog of repairs as road maintenance works were halted between April and July  due to the pandemic.Glasgow City Council insisted its roads were in a \"consistently better\" condition than the rest of Scotland."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13403261.jpg?type=article-full","title":"black-bitch-pub-eminent-black-professor-joins-chorus-horror-plans-ditch-pubs-name","story":"However, brewing giant Greene King clearly did not reckon with the dogged determination of the people of Linlithgow, in West Lothian.  Its plans to rename the Black Bitch amid fears it has racist and offensive connotations, sparked a torrent of protest plus a suggestion from Scotland’s leading human rights campaigner that its move might reinforce precisely what the company is trying to prevent.  Now, eminent black professor Sir Geoff Palmer, a human rights campaigner, and Rory Boyle, Professor of Composition at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, have entered the fray. Professor Boyle, one of the country’s top composers, has given a spirited message of support and criticised “the woke” who have confused the meaning behind the pub’s name. : Furore over pub chain’s move to axe ‘racist’ name of historic innIn a letter to campaigners fighting the move to rename the pub The Black Hound, he said: “The time has come to stand up for historical tradition and not bow to the woke who seem not to have the intelligence to comprehend that the words ‘black bitch’ refer to a dog.” The pub takes its name from a -year-old story of a faithful black greyhound that swam across the town’s loch to deliver food to her incarcerated owner.  References to the legend can be found throughout the town a black dog featured on Linlithgow burgh seals in  and , and in the coat of arms in .   However, pub bosses claim the name is “racist and offensive” and suggested Linlithgow’s oldest hostelry be renamed The Black Hound instead.  In his letter of support, Professor Boyle told how he had been commissioned to write a classical work for the Fine Arts Brass Quintet and had taken his inspiration from the legend of the black greyhound.  He said: “Having researched all I could about Linlithgow I decided to use the wonderful legend of the dog as the basis of this new piece, which I titled Elegy For The Black Bitch. “This piece was nominated for a British Composer Award in : the illustrious  that nominated it clearly saw no racism or misogyny in the piece and I have no intention of changing the title.” : A tale of loyalty hijacked by wokes that will only help to fuel racismHis intervention follows outrage from locals, which has seen protests held outside the high street pub and a petition with , signatures.  The row has also united politicians and led to a UK parliamentary motion condemning the move as a “misguided attempt at virtue signalling”. Sir Geoff PalmerSir Geoff, Scotland’s first black professor, also suggested the move could be seen as actually causing offence to black people.   Speaking at the recent Icon Scotland Plenderleith Lecture, he said: “The owners of the pub want to change [the name] because they think they are doing me a favour. That’s not doing a favour for black people. If you change that name you are actually saying a black person is called a black bitch. “This is sometimes the lack of thinking that some people who mean well can carry out, and therefore that sign should remain because it’s referring to a story about a dog.” The campaign to save the name has also been supported by West Lothian Council. A motion supported by SNP, Labour and Conservative councillors said: “For generations, people who were born within the boundary of the Royal Burgh have been proud to be known as Black Bitches given their association with the town.  The original reason given for the name change, that it was racist effectively, now makes this a slur on the reputation of these residents.” A spokesman for Greene King said the company is considering responses to the name change and a final announcement on the proposed name change is expected shortly. However, the row has also turned focus on Greene King’s own history. Its founder, Benjamin Greene, was a pro-slavery plantation owner who opposed the Slavery Abolition Bill and kept enslaved people at his estates in Montserrat and St Kitts. Nick Mackenzie, Greene King’s chief executive, said: “As part of our commitment to being an anti-racist organisation we want our pub names to be welcoming and inclusive and that means taking action when there is a need to make a positive change for the better.” But Alistair Old, spokesman for the action committee fighting the proposal, said it had caused “deep anger and offence” and even led to racist abuse towards its members.  “Greene King’s actions and their damaging statements have also raised unhealthy isions in the town, and presented a target for racist iniduals to attack some of our members. “We sincerely hope Greene King will finally accept they have been over- zealous in their endeavors to be seen as an anti-racist organisation.  “They only weaken true cases of racism by targeting names which have no association with racist origins.” He added: “It is ironic that a company with a founder and a history steeped in the transatlantic slave trade should point the finger at Linlithgow’s heritage and its famous greyhound and claim it is racist and offensive  “Perhaps they should reflect on their own name instead as it has strong ties with the slave trade.” "},{"url":null,"title":"just-like-granny-used-make-forgotten-recipes-inspire-tv-chef","story":"Liver and kidneys, oxtails, seaweed, dried egg – and the unfortunate sheep – were the staples that Gregor MacLeod’s granny, Peggy Saunders, would use day in and day out in her kitchen at home on the Isle of Lewis.  Jotted down in her recipe book, Peggy meticulously detailed the ingredients for a wealth of traditional dishes which made use of whatever was close to hand, ensuring that,possible, nothing went to waste. As Peggy got older, her family moved on and her love of cooking shrunk down to simple dishes for herself. The much-loved recipe book was tucked away and forgotten.  It was only after she died and grandson Gregor began the task of clearing her belongings to make her house his own home, that the book with its  recipes, most jotted down in his granny’s cursive scrawl and others on slips of paper given to her by relatives and friends, turned up.  Fascinated by its contents, Gregor has now set himself a challenge to cook his way through granny’s much-loved dishes. Wherever he can, he uses the same old-fashioned ingredients while some dishes are given an updated twist to cater for modern and signicantly more squeamish tastebuds.  The results have been captured on film for a new BBC ALBA series, Cidsin Granaidh Chalanais , which follows Gregor, , as he wrestles with ingredients now largely consigned to the past and attempts to overcome his own trepidation when confronted with dishes which were among granny Peggy’s favourites.  While some recipes – such as ceann-cropaig, fish heads stuffed with oats and onions – Gregor could not find the stomach for, granny’s book also revealed forgotten gems waiting to be rediscovered.  Gregor says discovering the book and recreating the once much-loved recipes in what used to be her kitchen has been an emotional as well as culinary journey.  “She worked hard keeping the house and running it as a bed and breakfast,” he says.  “These recipes must have been important to her for her to write them down. They also show how times have changed now we might print out a recipe or bookmark a website, she would write it all down or keep these little scraps of paper with crumpled edges which were stashed away in the book.” Indeed, one of the challenges he faced was trying to decipher her handwriting and imagining how the finished dishes might have looked.  Often the recipes reflect a “pre-quinoa” age – not so very long ago – when tastes were simpler and more suited for the basic ingredients available around her Isle of Lewis croft, such as seaweed, wild berries, offal and fish scraps. The series follows Gregor as he enlists friends, family and neighbors to source ingredients such as carageen seaweed, foraged from the seashore and used to create a surprisingly tasty jelly-like vanilla-flavoured pudding.  Along the way, he finds out more about the ingredients and dishes which were once everyday staples on Scottish tables such as liver, kidneys, oxtail and mutton.Granny Peggy, like many island lasses, left Lewis as a young woman to find work in Glasgow, sending what she could from her meagre wages back home to help her family.  In the aftermath of the Second World War she was working as a cook for a well-off family in a large home in Prince’s Terrace, Dowanhill, where she honed her skills using rationed ingredients like dried egg.  She married husband Norman MacLeod and, on ing from Glasgow, worked a croft Callanish while caring for her family. She later launched her bed and breakfast business at the house in Callanish – one of the first of its kind on the island.  In the series, which airs next month Gregor attempts her old-fashioned recipes, even overcoming the “horrendous smell” of the powdered egg to create a delicious Bakewell tart and tackling once common dishes such as oxtail stew, liver casserole and homemade oatcakes. The recipe book has revived memories of visiting his grandmother’s kitchen as a child – some more pleasant than others.  “I’d come through the door and she would have a sheep’s head on the grill to singe it, and the place would be ‘honking’,” he laughs. “It was enough to put you off food forever – the only thing worse when was my father, who she taught to cook, would cook guga. “That was the cue for my mother and me to have macaroni cheese.” A more tasteful memory comes from the pancakes which were almost always bubbling on the griddle and strips of salted meat that his granny hung next to the Rayburn oven.  “It was hard and rubbery mutton which had been dried,” recalls Gregor. “They would be hanging there forever, wrapped up in newspaper. She’d tear a piece off and cook it in soup where it would add flavour and flakes of meat. It was really tasty.” Granny’s kitchen supplied almost constant pots of mince and tatties, and steaming thick broth to fuel the peat season, when it would be delivered with a very welcome dram of Ballantine’s whisky.  The book also reveals a love for sweet treats: there are five dferent recipes for shortbread including one using rice floor, favourites like marmalade, rhubarb and orange jam, gingerbread and Scottish tablet.  Peggy died aged . Having lost her appetite, Gregor remembers that as she aged and her appetite shrunk, she made do with small snacks. Eventually her kitchen at  Callanish, overlooking a nearby loch and in the shadow of the ancient stones, fell quiet.  The book, with its flavours of the past, serves as a reminder of the way things were and provided inspired for Gregor to create new recipes, fusing her marmalade with her Bakewell Tart recipe, switching her trle recipe with amaretto biscuits and reinventing her fishcake recipe using home smoked trout.  Gregor, who revived his granny’s BB business, says the recipe book has helped him rethink his own approach to some traditional dishes. “I made her liver and kidneys dish which at first I thought I really couldn’t stomach. It turned out to be really tasty.” Cidsin Granaidh Chalanais , has been produced by  Glasgow-based Caledonia TV for BBC ALBA.

It is more important than ever we all get vaccinated to protect ourselves, our family and friends. Boosters increase our protection against the virus up to more than  per cent.We talk to myth-busting medical experts who answer your most frequently asked questions about these essential jabs. vw, px\"  What protection does a booster jab give Dr Emeka Okorocha, who works in AE in London and South East, said: “As a doctor, I have seen first-hand the effect COVID- can have on people. I want to remind everyone you can still get seriously ill with the virus, so it is so important to get the jab to keep ourselves, your friends and loved ones safe. COVID- is highly infectious. The vaccine remains our best line of defence against it. Omicron is highly transmissible and still has the potential to lead to signicant numbers of people in hospital, so it’s so important your immunity is topped up, and to come forward for your first or second doseyou haven’t already. We don’t know what threat any future iants may pose, soyou haven’t come forward for any jabs, it is absolutely essential you do so.”When can you have a booster jab Yorkshire-based Professor Mahendra G Patel OBE, Pharmacy and Inclusion and Diversity Lead, said: “You can get a COVID- booster three months after your second dose and  days after positive COVID test. It’s also not too late to get a first or second dose. Getting the vaccine has never been easier. Everybody aged  and over have now been offered two doses of a COVID- vaccine. If you are  years old or above on the day the vaccinations are taking place in school, you will be able to access a vaccine.If you have not yet had a COVID- vaccine, it’s not too late. Appointments for first doses of COVID- vaccines are still available for anyone unvaccinated.”Is it safe to have a booster jabI’m pregnant London-based Dr Jenny Jardine from Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who is also seven months pregnant and has had her COVID- booster jab, said: “Both as a doctor and pregnant mother myself, we can now be very confident the COVID- vaccinations provide the best possible protection for you and your unborn child against this virus. I would strongly call on all pregnant women like me,you haven’t had the vaccine yet, to either speak to your GP or midweyou still have questions and then book right away today.”Does a booster jab carry side effects Dr Okorocha said: “The COVID- vaccine is quick, easy and free. Don’t worry about the side effects. Like all medicines, the COVID- vaccines may cause some side effects, but most of these are mild and short-term, lasting no longer than a week, and not everyone gets them. Also,you weren’t able to get your booster dose because you had COVID-, remember to book your jab  days after you no longer have the virus.”How easy is it to get a booster jab Bradford-based NHS Dr Amir Khan said: “We know many people are juggling busy lives, which is exactly why the NHS is making it as easy as possible for you to get your booster. New walkin vaccination sites have been set up across the country, and existing sites have extended their opening hours, so as many people as possible can get jabbed as soon as possible. And, once you’ve had your vaccine, then why not encourage your friends and family to book as well, so we all have the best protection possible.”How effective is a booster jab Prof Patel said: “New analysis of vaccine efficacy by UKHSA has found protection against hospitalisation from vaccines is good against the Omicron iant. When the reduced risk of hospitalisation was combined with vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was estimated as  per cent two weeks after a booster dose. One dose of any vaccine was associated with a  per cent reduced risk of hospitalisation among symptomatic cases with the Omicron iant, two doses with a  per cent reduction up to  weeks after the second dose and a  per cent reduced risk  or more weeks after the second dose.”Your booster jab is vital vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is moored on a single tension tether. The subsea location and ability to winch low in the water column enables extreme storm loadings to be avoided so that the device can continue to operate in rough sea conditions. The Waveswing is designed to react to long ocean swell waves as well as short, wind-driven seas, for high energy capture.The £. million prototype project has been funded by Wave Energy Scotlandas part of the Novel Wave Energy Converter development programme. The demonstration at EMEC is also supported by the Interreg North-West Europe’s Ocean DEMO project.Neil Kermode, managing director, EMEC said:“We’re delighted to welcome AWS and the Archimedes Waveswing to Orkney and support its deployment and testing at our site in Scapa Flow.“Real sea deployment is a vital step in proving performance, reliability and survivability of these devices. We know that prototype testing at sea is really valuable to technology developers to check how a technology and its components work and react in the environment prior to scaling up. We are looking forward to helping the team as they prove how to install, operate and maintain their exciting machine in Orkney’s harsh conditions.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I think it just kind of all came out at once.”Barty took her grand slam tally to three having won the French Open in  and Wimbledon last summer and becomes the only active female player other than Serena Williams to have won major titles on three dferent surfaces.SHES DONE IT 🇦🇺🏆🇦🇺@ashbarty becomes the first Australian to win the #AusOpen Womens Singles title since !! pic eYzyNVwn— wtaJanuary , She has been world number one since September  and, having begun last season with major question marks over the legitimacy of that position after the Covid- hiatus, it is now clear that Barty is not only the best player in the world by some distance but the serial young champion that many feel women’s tennis has been missing.Barty looked understandably nervous early on and dropped serve for only the second and third times this tournament in successive games in the second set before digging herself out of the hole.The -year-old, who toasted her win with a beer on Australian TV, has always shrugged off talk of the expectation on her shoulders. vw,vw,px, px\"Russell Crowe watched the women’s final She said: “I think the expectation was that I would always come out and give my best, and that’s all I’ve ever done.“I have been close before, but I think now that we’ve been able to achieve this, I think you guys don’t need to talk about it any more.“You were the ones who added fuel to the fire, because for us it was just the same processes and the same enjoyment, regardless of where we’re playing in the world, what round it is.“That has no impact on how much I enjoy my tennis and go out there or how much I try and compete. vw,vw,px, px\"Danielle Collins celebrates an important point in the second set “This fortnight, seven times I got to walk out onto a beautul court with incredible fans and try and do the best I can do.“Now to be able to have this part of my dream achieved is amazing, and I think I have to really understand that that came from the processes that we put in with my team and the people that are around me because, without them, I wouldn’t be half the person that I am.”Barty’s coach Craig Tyzzer has guided her since she took her first steps back on court in  after leaving the sport as a teenager.“There’s a massive sense of pride in Ash and her ability to do what she’s done,” he said.A Grand Slam champion on three dferent surfaces, you are the complete player @AshBarty and I am so happy for you tonight.

It’s phenomenal. To be part of it is amazing, but I’m thrilled every day to work with Ash. What she does never surprises me, but I’m just glad that I’m part of it.”Another key inspiration in Barty’s le is four-time Australian Open champion Evonne Goolagong Cawley, with whom she shares Aboriginal heritage.Having thought Goolagong Cawley would not be able to make it to the tournament, Barty received a wonderful surprise when she learned before the presentation ceremony that it would be her mentor giving her the trophy.Our Queen of our Court.

Very lucky to be able to give her a hug in some of the biggest moments in my le.”Collins, who revealed she had been struggling with a lower back issue during the tournament, was the latest first-time slam finalist and she pushed Barty much closer than any other opponent this fortnight.Wow!!! #BARTYPARTY 🎾🏆 HUGE congrats to @ashbarty Such and inspiration.

I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of . A documentary on the band is also due to be aired on BBC Alba soon."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642067512749.jpg--take_part_in_this_year_s_big_garden_birdwatch.jpg?1642067512000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220113newstake part in this year s big garden birdwatch","story":"Keep your eyes wide open, get the kettle on and grab your binoculars as RSPB NI encourage you to join in on the charity’s Big Garden Birdwatch this month.

Lt Lyons joined the Army Cadet Force  years ago after a long career in the reserve army and has since changed the lives of many of his cadets and his certicate is as a result of the positive impact he and his Detachment made through their volunteering efforts.

We have taken back control of our waters and a year on from the Trade and Co-operation Agreement a positive picture is emerging for our fishing industry, he continued.ldquoWe have seen an increase in quota that will amount to around poundm by  and are investing poundm into coastal communities so that they can benefit from better infrastructure, new jobs and investment in skills.Local councillor Dermot Curran is encouraging people to respond to the consultation exercise, to reduce the impact of fishing on the marine environment, as well as support the industry. And he hopes that all three Co Down fishing ports will benefit from the funding that is to be made available.ldquoI am keen to see more detail to see exactly how Ardglass in particular can benefit from financial support at a time when there is much focus on a range of work that is required at the village harbour, Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThe need to deepen the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is key moving forward, but the need to have a dedicated boat repair facility in the village has also been raised with me. Currently, vessels have to go where to be repaired.ldquoIf Ardglass had its own dedicated repair facility, it would not only be able to service local boats but those based in other ports. Investment to repair boats locally would also create jobs.Cllr Curran said everyone with an interest in the fishing industry should make the most of the opportunity to comment on the detail in the joint fisheries statement.ldquoConfirmation that poundm is being made available for fishing communities is excellent news and I hope that the ports of Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie will be able to share this very welcome additional financial investment, he continued.ldquoThis is an important step forward and clearly Minister Poots is committed to the Co Down fishing industry and the processing industries and communities which rely heavily upon it. This new investment will help safeguard all their respective futures which is good news. The investment will boost the local and regional economy.Last year, it was revealed that investment in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities.The Fishing and Seafood Development Programme reportrsquos recommendations for Ardglass included enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses,The report revealed that a survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass showed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report said there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.It was also noted that a constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Caoimhe.jpg","title":"Caoimhe raises £900 for turtle rehabilation scheme in Maldives  ","story":"WHEN it comes to conservation, Downpatrick woman Caoimhe Morgan-Burns practices what she preaches.The  year-old has raised pound by collecting rubbish from the sides of the Ardglass Road and Ballysallagh Road.The money is to go towards the cost of a pound, trip to Naaru Island in the Males in June where Caoimhe will devote four weeks of her time to volunteer at a sea turtle rehabilitation centre.The trip will mean a lot to Caoimhe, a former pupil at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, as she will head to Bristol University in September to study Wildle Ecology and Conservation Science.Caoimhe plans to plant some trees on her familyrsquos land so and is thinking up of other fund-raising initiatives towards the cost of the trip.She spent over five hours removing rubbish from the edges of the road and was dismayed by how much she collected from her own home road.ldquoI collected  bin bags full of rubbish.

The winning schools each received pound of NIFQA beef and lamb, kindly sponsored by ABP Food Group.Livestock and Meat Commission education and consumer promotions manager, Sarah Toland, explained that one of the key drivers for the competition was to encourage the use of NIFQA beef and lamb in schools and to complement the organisationrsquos existing schools programme.ldquoWith this in mind we specically targeted food and nutrition teachers and their students when drawing up the criteria for the project, she said.Sarah congratulated the winning schools, noting that as the competition received an encouraging number of entries, to select the top three was no easy task.De La Salle teacher Irene Stokes said the competition helped increase awareness of the importance of sourcing local NIFQA produce.She added: ldquoThis competition allowed our students an opportunity to highlight the vital nutrients that beef and lamb provide and how both can add iety, colour,flavour and texture to any dish. ldquoOur students are also becoming increasingly aware of sourcing meats that have the NIFQA symbol and the impact this has on the local economy.Down High teacher Sharon McKee said the competition was a ldquofabulous way of encouraging students to consider the valuable contribution of red meat in their diet.She added: ldquoOur Year  pupils are currently investigating the nutritional and dietary needs of adolescence so this competition fitted well into our curriculum and brought the theory to le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Downe.jpg","title":"Downe partnership to help map future  ","story":"THE first meeting of a new forum involving health chiefs, hospital campaigners, trade unions and politicians to oversee service provision at the Downe hospital is expected to take place in the spring.The South Eastern Trust mdash which is responsible for the hospital and the delivery of a raft of health and social services across the community mdash has described the creation of the new Downe Health and Care Partnership Forum as exciting.Last summer, South Down MP Chris Hazzard suggested to senior health chiefs that a new partnership involving a range of key players should be established to help map out the most appropriate model of health care for the area and it will soon become a reality.Health chiefs said the forum, which is the first of its kind in Northern Ireland, said the two key objectives are to plan for the future with everyone who uses services in the area and work in partnership to improve the health and wellbeing of the community.The health trust said this is in line with the organisationrsquos so-called ldquoquality  all strategy which puts excellent care at the centre of what it does.Officials say the new forum will consider local population health and social care needs, support people to lead healthier lives and take action to reduce health inequalities.Health trust chief executive, Roisin Coulter, said the organisation wants to work collaboratively with the local community regarding existing health and social care services to plan and design for the future.ldquoWorking in partnership with a wide range of key stakeholders will be vital to the forumrsquos success.

I accused the departmental officials of paralysis by analysis and unfortunately that has proved to be true.ldquoSince then, of course, the traffic congestion, which is now traffic chaos, has been greatly increased by the Irish Street closure, and it should be noted that not a single traffic management action has been initiated in the interval, he continued.NEWCASTLE ndash A cross-community unity campaign has been launched to save Newcastlersquos only public residential home from closure.Mourne House has been targeted for closed by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board but this week local politicians have joined with the Friends of Mourne House in mobilising public support against the plan.Representatives from the Friends group have already met with Board officials in a bid to persuade them to adopt a proposal from the charity, Age Concern, which is offering to take over the management of the  year-old home.DUNDRUM ndash Over pound, damage has been caused in another arson attack in Dundrum.Two caravans were completely destroyed and another badly damaged in the attack at the Bayview Caravan Site off the Dromara Road early on Saturday morning.It is believed the blazes were started in the early hours and two of the caravans were well alight by the time fire crews arrived on the scene.The incident is the latest in a long line of malicious arson attacks in the village which police believe are the work of a pyromaniac.Just before Christmas the villagersquos two primary schools were targeted with the Downshire Primary School sustaining over pound, damage. The arsonist has also attacked Dundrum cricket club, the orange hall and the parochial hall.BRYANSFORD ndash Plans have been announced to convert one of Bryansfordrsquos most historic landmarks into apartments, a craft shop and a restaurant.The former home of the Earl of Roden, close to the gates of Tollymore Park, will be converted into eight apartments, and an outbuilding will be extended to form a craft shop and restaurant facilityplanning permission is granted by the DoE.A further planning application proposes to build a number of luxury apartments on a site to the rear of the building, with an access from the nearby Burrenreagh Road.The building, which comprises extensive outbuildings and a courtyard, was used as a travellersrsquo inn during the last century when the Roden family lived in Tollymore House in the forest park.Since the destruction of Tollymore House the inn has been the home of the present Earl of Roden. In  it was the scene of an antiques robbery in which Lord Roden was tied up and threatened as raiders stole valuable paintings and antiques.Part of the outbuildings were regularly used by youth groups for residential weekends in the Mournes.BALLYNAHINCH ndash The job losses at the Ballynahinch GPT plant mean the lsquoBig Threersquo players in Down District industry no longer top the  jobs mark.GEC Plessey Telecommunications was the last of the lsquoBig Threersquo to employ more than  on one site.The lay-offs mean there are virtually no large-scale industrial employers left in Down.The GPT plant has been set on a steady course of expansion, even after the amalgamation of Plessey, as it then was, with GEC in . It took over the vacant Albion clothing factory on the Antrim Road and at one point last year was employing  people.The number has been whittled away and will be reduced to  employees.The other two major employers have also been hit over the last four years. The Shirley Tannery, owned by English-based Pittard Garnar at the time, employed  until its closure was announced in February . Although it re-opened later that year, the numbers employed has been dramatically scaled down.The decline in the numbers is even more pronounced when it is considered that in its heyday in the late rsquos, the tannery employed up to  people.STRANGFORD ndash There has been a renewed call for a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry.The newly-formed Strangford Lough Bridge Project Group says a bridge across the Strangford Narrows is the only means of guaranteeing a continuous link across the lough.However, the group accepts that a scheme involving a barrage to harness tidal power would be environmentally unacceptable.Group chairman, Mr James McMullan, from Portaferry, said ldquoI believe there is overwhelming support for a bridge.ldquoPeople in Portaferry are concerned about the future of the DoE ferry service. A bridge has to be the ultimate answer. It would provide a link  hours a day and would not be subject to breakdowns, he continued.And Mr McMullan says he intends to seek the support of local councillors for his proposal.ldquoI accept a barrage would have environmental implications but a bridge on its own would benefit communities on both sides of the lough, he added.RACING ndash A campaign to introduce Sunday horse racing in Britain could result in Sabbath day racing coming under starters orders at Downpatrick.Mr Iain Duff, course registrar at Downpatrick, has given his support to the Jockey Club campaign and is demanding sweeping changes in legislation which prohibits betting on a Sunday.Mr Duff says Downpatrick and Down Royal ndash the Provincersquos other racetrack ndash should be allowed to hold Sunday meetings.Mr Duff says the law could be changed easily by making an Order in Council which would then enable tracks to hold meetings when people are most prepared to go racing on Sunday.He believes the move is needed to bring racing here into line with the Republic where Sunday racing was introduced some years ago.ldquoSunday racing in the Republic has proved to be a wholesale success. Surveys have shown more people go racing on a Sunday than on any other day, he remarked.ldquoYet the Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture last November rejected the appeals of deputations representation Downpatrick and Down Royal seeking an equal opportunity.Mr Duff said thatSunday racing is permitted, the law relating to gambling would have to be changed.Mr Duff added: ldquoEverybody in racing respects the views of people who may be against Sunday racing, but I donrsquot think they should be allowed to dictate to the majority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Matt.jpg","title":"Matthew survives on Dancing With The Stars  ","story":"LOVE Islander Matthew MacNabb survived the first public vote in RTErsquos Dancing With The Stars mdash despite gaining the lowest number of points.The Downpatrick man was faced with the challenge of dancing the jive on Sundayrsquos show, known to be notoriously dficult for tall male dancers.Standing at ft in, the  year-old admitted it was tough going, but was personally delighted with his effort with professional dance partner Laura Nolan.Speaking from Dublin on Monday, Matthew told the Recorder: ldquoI was happy with my dance last night as I had a nightmare with it all week trying to get the timing and coordination down.ldquoThat was the best I danced it and I worked so hard all week but I guess giraffes arenrsquot meant to jive.In the end, it was novelist Cathy Kelly who was the first celebrity to leave the show.The local GAA player and digital marketing consultant said he had been overwhelmed by the support and votes he had received.He said: ldquoTo be bottom and to get through shows how amazing people are to vote for me and I really appreciate it.

THE big match of the week saw the top two teams face off against each other as the league leaders from Killyleagh made the trip to Spa to face the only team to have beaten them this year.They were just left to pick up the crumbs as the hosts continued their unbeaten run which led to this big win that no makes them favourites for the league with two games in hand and only eleven points behind with four rounds left to play.Davy Cavan, Paul and Don McNamara were up against Stevie Brown, Kieran McMullan and Ricky Cathcart and after four ends it was all square at -. But then Don upped the pressure and the hosts dominated thefinal ends to run out - winners.On the other mat the home triple of Hilary Cavan, Robin Horner and Graham Christie were playing some great bowls against Paddy Murray and after lting a count of six on the third end would only lose three ends in their - win. At the break the home side had a -shot overall lead.The Saints made a slight comeback in the third game as Philip Woodside, David Anderson and Neil Brown continued their good run of form against Frances and Derek McCann and skip Alan Laughlin, who after losing the first two ends won the next three to go - up before Alan hit back to make it it - after seven ends.This would be as good as it would get as the visitors won the last three ends to finish - winners to secure the only away points of the match.A mention must go to this triple for playing and controlling this game so well, especially as Philip had a throwback to past times with the quality of lead bowls.The last game of the night saw Rose Marie Wylie, Davy Vance and Peter Christie score seven shots from the first two ends against Terry Quinn, Nigel Brown and Tony Ward.They never relinguished this lead as the game finished - in their favour to secure another great win.Surely now no-one can stop Spa from continuing on and finish the season unbeaten and as champions.DROMARA.....................

Dromararsquos Denis Kane, Richard Kelly and JamesMcKinney took control of their game against Haydn Tumelty, Dermot Rooney and Liam Higgins and even though they won only four ends and scored  shots to win -, this left Dromara with a five-shot lead in the overall.Owenbeg finally got going in the final game as Nathan Tumelty, Alan Telford and Collie Gibson really put Marie McNeill, Phil and Eamon Kelly to the sword.They only let their opponents score two shots as they scored steadily and heavily to run out victors by a - margin.It has to be said that Nathan was giving his team-mates an easy time with his standard of lead bowls on what are tricky mats.This win was enough to get Owenbeg the extra points and scrape an overall draw.ST MACARTANrsquoS...........

How are your New Year resolutions going How many times do you decide to lsquostop thisrsquo, lsquostart thatrsquo, and find a few weeks later that you have blown it and feel guilty and frustrated with yourself Starting all over again on the back of frustration and then pushing yourself even harder, making it increasingly dficult to stick to your resolution Breaking habits or quitting something on the surface seem like great ideas when wanting to improve your health and well-being. Irsquod love to introduce you to approaches that are foundations that last and make you feel empowered and happier in  and beyond.What I think is essential, when we want to stop a bad habit or make a change in our lives, is to make sure that we are on our own side.Self-compassion is basically being your own best friend. When we are with our best friend, we listen to them. We comfort them and speak on their behalfthey ask us to help them. To get the cogs in motion,answer yes or no to the following questions:Do you find it hard to say no Do you find it dficult to take a compliment Do you criticise yourself often Do you compare yourself to others Do you worry about what others think about you How many were answered lsquoyesrsquo Maybe after everything that we all have been through over the last couple of years,  has the possibility to be the year that you remember as the year you began to take control, to recover and heal.  could be the year when you started loving yourself more.There are three elements that I would like to introduce today that are to be consideredyou want to feel empowered and active in real self-care.AwarenessAwareness begins with the practice of noticing. It helps us be in the present moment and be calm as we take in the sights, sounds and touch mdash even taste mdash around us.Mindfulness and meditation have been trendy in recent years, but from my one-to-one counselling work, quite a few people have said that ldquoit didnrsquot work for them, or ldquoI didnrsquot really see the benefits.Once we talked about that more, we came to the realisation that they were practicing mindfulness to not feel, to escape feeling uncomfortable or to push away dficult or negative thoughts. As a practice, things changed for the better once my clients were made aware that mindfulness was to observe their feelings and observe their thoughts with an open mind as attention was gently brought back to the breath.Taking little pockets of time in our day to consciously pause, taking a few breaths in and out and observe, can immediately let our bodies and minds be calm and focused.The small daily things are the most important things to ensure real change. You can try this little exercise and be aware how your body and mind feels:S  ndash Step back.T ndash Take three deep breaths in and three slow breaths out.O  ndash Observe the thoughts and feelings in that very moment.P ndash Proceed.Awareness also involves being able to see patterns that arise in our thoughts and feelings, as well as the behavioural outcome. Kind of like detective work, we are then able to reframe our thinking, as well as breaking the familiar cycle of judgement and frustration. Just a wee word about practicing awareness mdash it is not about self control. Awareness helps us to begin to understand ourselves and develop self compassion and practice patience .Essentially, self awareness is about empowering ourselves and providing regulation of our body and mind. Self-regulation in turn, seeks to identy and reduce the causes of problems in mood, thought and behaviour.Self-control seeks to inhibit or manage such problems only when they arise. Self-control looks at old methods of punishment and reward to manage behaviour ndash maybe like the way we begin every New Year resolution mdash or every Monday, etc.AcceptanceEspecially when a New Year starts ndash therersquos this pressure to go to extreme measures, with this notion of being accepted more, to be seen and or valued more. But pretty much into the month of January we notice how it can rob us of truly living.We are not human DOINGS ndash we are human BEINGS. I have worked over the last  years as a counsellor and have heard people talk about trying to control their lives, but feeling like it was evading them more and more.Clients found themselves going harder, pushing harder, feeling exhausted, feeling helpless ndash then pulling up their socks and trying again. Although it may go against the grain of whatrsquos familiar, itrsquos healing to ease ourselves from a place of trying mdash to be perfect, as good as others, etc mdash to self-acceptance.Accepting lessens the pressure and helps us go with the flow.Self-acceptance is a journey. If anyone  needs to put pressure on us, itrsquos them who needs to deal with their own expectations mdash not us. Acceptance challenges deeply held beliefs that we are not lsquoworthyrsquo enough or lsquogoodrsquo enough to be whole. Like awareness, acceptance develops self compassion ndash a connected relationship with ourselves.In Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, there is a theory called Radical Acceptance developed by Martina Linehan, who quotes: ldquoRejecting reality turns pain into suffering.It is really tough to accept things how they are, from childhood trauma to unexpected traffic jams. It is really such a relief and sense of clarity when we realise and accept things that we are not in control of.It is absolutely OK to feel whatever we feel in the moment. Itrsquos not just sitting back and letting bad things happen of course. It is quite pro-active from problem solving based on how things actually are, self compassion when paying attention to how we feel in the moment. Meeting emotional pain head on, after all, it is what it is. Acceptance means no more unnecessary suffering.AssertionGabor Mate talks about assertion as a declaration to ourselves and to the world that lsquowe arersquo and that lsquowe are who we arersquo. Itrsquos not being simply able to stand up for ourselves mdash therersquos something more heartfelt than that.Assertion challenges the all too common belief that we must somehow justy our existence. There are lots of things that we can learn about and practice when it comes to assertion in itself, but maybe after reading the first two elements you are realising that our inidual minds, bodies and spirit are all so important.Making decisions about diets, relationships, careers, etc, usually get focused on a lot more during the month of January, as well as quitting things and going cold turkey on habits that have been part of our lives for years.Assertion isnrsquot just a quick course from a manual or podcast about tips and tricks. It is a really important statement of our being. It is a positive valuation of ourselves mdash independent of our history, abilities, personality or the worldrsquos perception of us.In regards to resolutions, assertion doesnrsquot involve action or reaction. Like I said before, it is our BEING, no matterwe take action or not. Assertion helps us be crystal clear about what we value and what is not OK with us as iniduals.From our values we can develop boundaries. Yes, let the rest of the world cope with that, or not. In fact, assertion may be the very opposite of action, not only in the sense of refusing to do something that we do not wish to do, but letting go of the very need to act at all.I really do hope that  gives you gts and wonderful surprises, as well as the comfort and support over dficult times. If you feel that you like to find out more about ways of real self care, developing good habits and creating change, you can contact me on  .For the month of January, I am offering free -minute assessment sessions.

Thirty eight percent of drivers were detected driving at between mph and mph.The provision of the series of electronic devices was in response to community concern about speeding across the district and viewed as part of a major offensive on those who break the law and to encourage drivers to slow down.PCSP officials say the average speeds recorded in Downpatrick, Killyleagh and Newcastle have reduced with no change in Newcastle. However, concern remains about the dangerous speeds that continue to be recorded with some drivers showing a blatant disregard for the speed limits in place.The highest speed recorded at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick was mph in the mph zone at am, with  drivers detected travelling at over mph. Previous speeds recorded at the built-up area have peaked at mph.Residents in the built-up area, which includes a signicant number of houses, a nursing home and local authority depot, have continually expressed concern about the speed of drivers who use the busy road and argue that the speed sign needs to be relocated further back towards the Lecale Park entrance.The highest speed recorded at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan was mph at am, with  drivers recorded travelling in excess of mph, with % of drivers detected travelling between mph and mph.Elsewhere, one driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone at the Dundrum Road in Clough at am, with one driver clocked driving in excess of mph.In Killyleagh, a driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone on the approach to the townrsquos Integrated Primary School, with  drivers clocked at over mph. The highest number of offences was recorded at pm.The highest speed recorded at the Newcastlersquos South Promenade was mph, with two drivers recorded travelling at over mph. The highest number of speed offences were recorded around am.Across the council area, the latest figures indicate that recorded speeds have reduced by six percent. The average speed of cars travellingpast each sign was mph in Ardglass and Clough, mph in Castlewellan, mph in Downpatrick, mph in Newcastle and mph in Newcastle.The PCSP is planning to install seven more speed indicator signs with demand for the devices described as ldquohigh with particular interest from residents and councillors in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and Mournes district electoral areas.Local councillor Dermot Curran, who lives in Ardglass, has described the mph speed recorded at the Downpatrick Road in the village as ldquotruly shocking.He said while the number of drivers breaking the ious speed limits is reducing, there were a number ldquothumbing their noses at the restrictions in place and posing a serious danger to other road users and pedestrians.ldquoThe fact that drivers are not slowing down in built-up areas, regardless of the time of day, is a real worry.

She lived in the period -AD and was a visionary spiritual leader and inspirational woman, she explained.ldquoBrigid was recognised as a saint from around the seventh century and seven dferent lsquolivesrsquo of St Brigid were written which is indicative of the cult following she had.ldquoHer feast day is on February which is the first day of spring mdash Imbolc in the Celtic calendar. There are three other feasts in the Celtic calendar mdash May , Bealtaine August , Luacutenasa and November,  Samhain. Each of the feasts has associated with it a specic set of beliefs and customs.ldquoThere was a pre-Christian aspect to the feast on February . The main importance of the feast of St Brigid would appear to be that it was a christianisation of one of the key dates in the farming year in Ireland. In earlier centuries in Ireland and in many areas St Brigidrsquos day was observed as a holiday and some farming related activities were not permitted. In , the government of the Republic of Ireland decided to make the February  a bank holiday. This is an inspired choice of date for the new bank holiday.Brigid said the main customs associated with St Brigidrsquos Day are the making of St Brigidrsquos crosses the Briacutedeoacuteg and the Brat Briacutede. These customs were traditionally practiced on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day as according to Celtic timing, night came before day.The custom of making St Brigidrsquos crosses is still widespread throughout Ireland. There are regional iations across Ireland in the design and composition of the cross. The most common one is the simple four armed cross.ldquoThe explanation of the custom is that St Brigid made the cross when she was comforting a dying man who wished to convert to Christianity. She placed it in his hands, explained Brigid. ldquoPeople believe that the St Brigidrsquos cross offers protection from sickness and other forms of adversity for their homes, family and animals.ldquoToday in Co Down farming and non-farming families still want to get a St Brigidrsquos cross for this reason. In Ulster, a three-armed cross was placed in the stable or byre for the protection of animals. Throughout my le I have made St Brigid crosses for our home.ldquoAs a teacher I have taught groups of pupils how to make the cross. It is important that we pass on customs and traditions to the next generation and do not lose the wealth of culture we have in Ireland.She said that the Briacutedeoacuteg is another custom associated with St Brigidrsquos Day. It consisted, or consists, of a group of young people called briacutedeoga, lsquobiddiesrsquoor biddy-boys going from house to house carrying an effigy of St Brigid .The children received some donation at each house visited. Often a doll was made for the occasion. The body of the doll may have been made from a sheaf of straw. A ball of hay, straw or turnip was used to represent the head. It was usually constructed with a strong stick or churn-dash at its core.The use of the churn dash was thought to reflect the saintrsquos association with dairying. A purchased rag doll might be used. Whether a doll was made or purchased, it was a representation of St Brigid and was dressed in white.The original objective of the exercise was the collection of alms for the poor. The group always provided some entertainment for the homes visited with singing or music. The girls and boys in the group dressed up in disguise for the occasion. The custom lasted longest in Co Kerry and still survives today in a few areas.The third important custom which was widespread throughout Ireland is known as the brat Briacutede . A piece of cloth, larger than a hankerchief, was put on a bush outside the home on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day and it was not usually brought in until morning.Brigid added: ldquoThe belief was that when St Brigid was travelling around the country that night and she came across the cloth, she blessed it with the curative powers of her cloak. It was put away and used as a healing cloth throughout the year for sickness, pain and as protection against harm. With changes in society this custom has only survived in some areas including the south and west of Ireland.The historian said that Saint Brigid, who is strongly associated with nature and farming, is ldquoa saint for our times. With the environmental crisis facing us we can learn from the reverence which the early Celtic saints, including St Brigid, showed towards nature. They appreciated the fundamental importance of nature to humanity.ldquoThe challenges we face today are much greater than those in the th and th centuries but the need for social justice is the same. May the le of St Brigid be an inspiration to all to take action for a better world.When she died St Brigid was buried beside the high altar in the church in Kildare. Her remains were brought to Downpatrick for reasons of safety at the time of the Viking raids on monasteries and reburied with those of St Patrick and St Colmcille at Down Cathedral.To book a place at pound for one of talks visit https:www.saintpatrickcentre friends saint-brigids-day-experiences..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13410648.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Now he seems secure again.Days ago Boris Johnson seemed finished as prime minister. It was being reported last night that the only people who can sack him, Tory MPs, were now beginning to rally behind his leadership.Anda week is a long time, a year is an eternity.Arlene Foster’s demise was sudden. Edwin Poots’s rise to be her DUP successor was swt and his fall from that post almost as fast.Then only weeks ago there seemed to be a Westminster solution to the DUP’s challenge in getting its third leader in quick succession, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, into Stormont without having immediately to give up his Lagan Valley constituency and force a risky by-election there.But then that proposal — a temporary exemption to the double jobbing ban — was pulled from under him and there was fresh focus on how the DUP would manage the ious obstacles to finding a seat for Sir Jeffrey in the constituency where he is long established, but so are Mr Poots and Paul Givan.What then does last night’s political twist within the DUP mean By going for the South Down MLA nomination, Mr Poots was leaving the way clear for Mr Givan and Sir Jeffrey to be DUP MLAs for Lagan Valley .What did Jim Wells make of the Poots bid to move to the constituency in which Mr Wells is long established as the main DUP personality  Perhaps it was a disappointment, after Mr Wells had been such a gushing supporter of Edwin Poots as DUP leader.Or perhaps Mr Wells already knew that he was not going to be on the DUP shortlist, so it was not too much of a problem.Mr Poots will now have to cast around for another constituency.His leadership manoeuvre last May clearly annoyed much of the DUP establishment, who treated his victory with an overt coolness, even contempt, that the party rarely displayed in public towards senior figures, whatever private misgivings there might have been about any of them.Do some such figures now want to bury Mr Poots’s career entirely or were they only motivated by the view that Diane Forsythe was a better standard bearer in South Down One thing that strikes me about Mr Poots is an admirable ability to weather setbacks and even humiliations like his astonishingly brief tenure as DUP leader, and to soldier on without seeming bitter, so he might well cheerfully continue his search for a seat.The ious developments in unionism in recent weeks do not tell us much about ideological direction, except that the UUP and DUP are both chasing the liberal vote.In the case of Doug Beattie, it is a more explicit pitch to the values of the Alliance Party.In the case of Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, it is a move to capture the centre of unionism.But while the DUP is not moving in what anyone would call a strongly liberal direction, and while it still wants to be a broad church, it seems to have calculated that very traditional or fundamentalist Christian voters are sufficiently small in number that it can afford to lose many of them.It cannot afford to lose the growing numbers of people who are moderate on social questions such as abortion policy or same-sex relations. People, in other words, who are by no means radical on such matters but who are not traditionalists on them either.But all these political labels at times seem confused or contradictory.Doug Beattie is a ‘liberal’ who has, as a result of his tweets, potentially fallen foul of voters who have a ‘woke’ outlook on the world. He also took quite a robust unionist line on matters such as legacy and the Irish language.Edwin Poots is a ‘conservative’ who was in fact notably pragmatic on issues such as Gaelic and evenon the Irish Sea border.While it would not be quite right to characterise his politics as ‘liberal’ it was in no way hardline.Where will this all end Over the longer term unionism seems destined to become a centrist-leaning conservative movement. It will always been seen as somewhat on the right of the political spectrum because its primary position is preservation of the status quo. At the moment things seem bad for unionism, but that might not be so for long.There are still signs that very large numbers of voters, probably a comfortable majority, are themselves happy with the status quo.And radical liberal or leftist movements, in both the UK and the United States, have helped to bolster both the Conservative Party in England and the Republican Party in the US. In Northern Ireland, Alliance has been riding high for some years now, and certain polls suggest it could go higher still. But it might yet be damaged by its embracing of what some voters still consider to be ultra liberal values, or its europhilia A thing to watch is support for the TUV. Jim Allister’s standing in opinion polls fluctuates signicantly. He is trying to capture traditionalists, as is obvious from the party name, but also that large number of people who are very strong on the Union but not religious.l Ben Lowryis News Letter editor"},{"url":null,"title":"i hope that jim wells stands for election to stormont as an independent or with another party ","story":"Moment’s silence for crash victim Jon O’Hara at Ulster Rugby game against Scarlets   Jim Wells speaks of ‘confused situation’ as Edwin Poots to stand for election in South DownNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsOpinionI hope that Jim Wells stands for election to Stormont as an independent or with another partyA letter from Lee Maginnis:By LettersSaturday, th January , : amUpdated Saturday, th January , : am  \"       \"  Jim Wells pictured in May  after his re-election to the assembly for South DownI am dismayed at the treatment of Jim Wells by the DUP.

He tells Laura Harding about the emotional experienceBy The NewsroomFriday, th January , : pm  \"       \"  Kenneth Branagh has shown real flair in his direction of the autobiographical film, BelfastWhen Sir Kenneth Branagh was a little boy growing up in Northern Ireland, a mob of Protestants rioted down his street, smashing windows, brandishing pieces of wrought iron and threatening the Catholics who were living peacefully there.His family, who were Protestants themselves, were unharmed, but the moment was a defining one for the actor and director, who recreates the harrowing moment in the opening of his new semi-autobiographical film, Belfast.The family drama follows a little boy called Buddy, played by newcomer Jude Hill, whose family, including parents played by The Tourist’s Jamie Dornan and Outlander star Caitriona Balfe, are caught up in the Troubles at the end of the s, sparking his parents’ decision to leave their home behind.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

And it has had me quite a bit closer to tears on a day-to-day basis than I might otherwise be. But part of the process was understanding that tears can be helpful.”It was only during the editing process that Sir Kenneth, whose previous directing projects include Thor, Cinderella and Murder On The Orient Express – as well as a string of Shakespeare adaptations, thought about how the film might be received by others who had lived through this period in history.“The film sort of revealed that that’s what it was about, and that’s what it was for. The weight of sadness across the ious incidents, as well as the tenderness and the hard earned joy, just somehow allowed you to recognise that it was tough for everyone and it was a shared tragedy and the wound is still one that is shared by many people.  stars as Buddy and Jamie Dornan stars as Pa in director Kenneth Branaghs Belfast.PIC:PA Photo Rob Youngson Focus Features.\" \"\" width\"\" srcset\"https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMzMMDQy.jpg width w, https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMzMMDQy.jpg width w\" layout\"intrinsic\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-intrinsic i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"intrinsic\" stars as Buddy and Jamie Dornan stars as Pa in director Kenneth Branaghs Belfast.PIC:PA Photo Rob Youngson Focus Features.\" fallback layout\"responsive\" \"\" width\"\" src\" img placeholder.png\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"responsive\"Jude Hillstars as Buddy and Jamie Dornan stars as Pa in director Kenneth Branaghs Belfast. PIC: PA Photo Rob Youngson Focus Features.“It’s important to remember stories like this, lest we forget, because the peace which has to be won every day is hard earned and hard won, and I think, many, many, many people do not want to go back to those days.”While the film was deeply personal for its creator, it was also personal for its stars, many of whom grew up in the midst of the Troubles or felt their painful ripple effects.“I was born  years into a -year conflict,” says -year-old Dornan, who grew up in Belfast, “and I’ve seen the effect that it’s had on the place and the people, both during the conflict and the post-conflict society there. It couldn’t be more personal really, to be able to tell the story.“I left at , Caitriona left at , not to avoid the beginning of a war, but we all did for dferent reasons, and I understand what that means. And I’ve also spent  years going around the world, telling people I’m from Belfast and seeing all kinds of reactions to just that.“And I think this film can help to settle some of the ideas that people have about that place and the people in my place, because we get to see it through the eyes of a normal family and that’s really vital.”Balfe, , who was born in Dublin and grew up right on the border, added: “When I read the script one of the things that impacted upon me was just the compassion and the empathy Ken had for this ordinary working class family who had not asked for this. “We’ve seen many great films about the Troubles, but there’s been an absence of films just about the everyday family, who sort of got caught up among it.”From North Belfast to RADA and playing the great DaneSir Kenneth Charles Branagh was born on December , and trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London where he has served as president since . He has been nominated for five Academy Awards, as well as having won three BAFTAs, two Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award. Ken was knighted on November ,  and was made a Freeman of Belfast in January . In , he was listed at number  on Thelist of Ireland’s greatest film actors.Branagh has both directed and starred in several film adaptations of William Shakespeare’s plays, including Othello , and most notably Hamletwherein he played the tormented Dane and delivered the lapidary ‘To be or not to be’ speech with perhaps more fervour than any actor before or since. He was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor and Best Director for Henry V and for Best Adapted Screenplay for Hamlet.He has starred in innumerable television series and films including Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein , Wallanderand Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets .‘Overnight our street was turned into a war zone’ recalls Branagh of By Joanne SavageKenneth Branagh’s older brother Bill told Ann Ferran of The Sunday Times in : “Ken was a regular little boy growing up in Belfast, who played football in the street. When my father went away he’d bring us back a little matchbox car. I used to keep mine pristine clean, but Ken used to take the tyres off his.”In the same illuminating article, Ken said of the place where he grew up: “The area was predominantly Protestant, but there was a smattering of Catholics. Everybody got on. There was a real sense of community. “We had a large extended family. “Le in Belfast was very grounded and family-orientated, and Bill and I were thrown together - we shared a bed. I remember being in bed next to him, and whichever book he wasn’t reading for school I’d pick up. So I was introduced to Shakespeare through him. “The cardinal sin back in Belfast was to show off or make a fuss. ‘Don’t have any ideas above your station.’ That was my parents’ philosophy. “To them, money was only important for putting a roof over your head it wasn’t an end in itself. And a person’s religion made no dference to my parents, though not everyone in Belfast shared that view. “My Dad was a Protestant, but he was never in the Orange Order.”Sir Ken continued: “My mother had just got pregnant with my sister when things became quite intense in Belfast. One night Bill came running up our street saying: “Get in the house!” We heard a terrible buzzing noise. “I saw a sort of cloud at the bottom of the street, which turned out to be a huge bomb. “Bill pushed Mum and me under a table in the back room. We didn’t know it then, but it was the mob outside, who were picking up the iron gratings from the drains at the side of the roads and throwing them through the windows of the Catholic houses. “Hours later, there were barricades at the top and bottom of the street, while the men ided themselves into vigilante groups. “Our street had turned into a war zone overnight.“In the wake of that, my parents felt uneasy about Belfast. My father, who was a joiner, had been offered a job in England, at a management level, and they decided to take the opportunity.” Branagh added: “The move to England felt at times like some kind of betrayal. The transformation from that very grounded Belfast le, with its comfortable and simple expectations, had a profound effect on me. “I feel that only now do I have a strong sense of who I am in the way that I did in Belfast. “Today I’m less conflicted and guilt-ridden. And, believe me, Jews and Catholics don’t have a monopoly on guilt. “The Protestant work ethic was branded on my forehead:you are fit and talented it is your duty to use it.” Heartfelt tribute to a city with spirit defiantly undimmedFILM REVIEW: BELFASTBy Joanne SavageThis superbly directed film, shot in elegant monochrome, is a nostalgic and fiercely affectionate paean to a city that shaped its director in his heart and soul. Buddy, played by the adorable and wide-eyed Jude Hill, is a double for the young Ken, who, while crushing on the smartest girl in his class, and simply wanting to enjoy trips to the cinema to see Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and play in the street with a fake sword and a bin lid, struggles to understand why violence breaks out so suddenly and inexplicably, as he looks up with wonder at his Pa, played masterfully and with real sensitivity by Jamie Dornan, who refuses to be drawn into the persecution of his Catholic neighbours, and emerges as the moral centre of the piece, alongside Caitriona Balfe’s stoical and beautul Ma.Ciaran Hinds and Judi Dench are profoundly affecting as Buddy’s grandparents, full of earthy, Ulsterish wit and tenderness, even as the community outside their humble terraced abode becomes mired in internecine stre.The warmth and humour shared among the family at epicentre of the film stands in stark contrast to the street vigilantes who will no longer tolerate the Catholics among them.There is a wonderful moment where Popis helping Buddy with his maths homework. Pop, ailing in health, tells him to make his answers blurry, to keep the teacher guessing, he might get marked up or down, but does he want to impress his would-be classroom sweetheart or not  Still, Buddy wants to know the right answer. “If there were a right answer son, and we all knew it, would they be doing what they’re doing out there ” muses Pop. Some may find Branagh’s liberally applied doses of sugar to a narrative about the birth of Belfastian tragedy something of a sentimental gloss over the true horrors of , but actually what the much vaunted director achieves here is heroic and defiant: as those who chose violence raged, le still found a way, love triumphed over hatred in most homes and nothing could blot out the fundamental spirit of the right-thinking members of both communities. We’ve all seen gritty films about the Troubles that besieged Belfast, but what Branagh is really saying is that through the eyes of a young boy living with a loving family who protected him, it was still shot through with magic, wonder and people who did not care about who was Catholic or Protestant or neither.Certainly Dornan’s Pa tells Buddy that it doesn’t matterthe girl he loves is a “Catholic or a Hindu or a vegetarian Antichrist” because Everlasting Loveis a flame unextinguished, indeed, as Morrissey might say, a light that never goes out.RATING:  Belfast is in cinemas now."},{"url":null,"title":"poots and wells miss out as dup confirms diane forsythe for south down ","story":"Tim McGarry: Sorry Sir Kenny, but no-one was called Buddy in Belfast in    Policing Board don’t see intelligence on IRA ‘due to Sinn Fein plea’ says former top PSNI officerNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPoliticsPoots and Wells miss out as DUP confirms Diane Forsythe for South DownThe DUP has selected former Westminster candidate Diane Forsythe for the South Down constituency.By Mark RaineyFriday, th January , : pmUpdated Friday, th January , : pm  \"       \"  Diane Forsythe.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground.

St Valentine is the Roman patron saint of lovers as well as epileptics and beekeepers. He was said to be a Roman priest and physician who suffered martyrdom - welcoming death rather than denouncing his faith - during the persecution of Christians by emperor Claudius II Gothicus in around . He is said to have died on February  of that year and Valentines Day has been celebrated since approximately the th century.While the Welsh also celebrate Valentines Day, there is the Welsh equivalent - celebrating St Dwynwen - three weeks earlier on January . It is a popular celebration among Welsh speakers in the land, but it is becoming more widely popular across Wales, with the people of Wales professing their love to their loved ones in January.Who was St Dwynwen St Dwynwen was a Welsh princess who lived in the fourth century in what we know now as the Brecon Beacons National Park. She is the Welsh patron saint of lovers – despite being quite unlucky in love herself.She was said to be the prettiest of King Brychan Brycheiniog’s  daughters and fell in love with prince Maelon Dafodrill. To her dismay, her father had already arranged for her to marry someone .She was so upset and begged God to make her forget her love. During her sleep, she was visited by an angel carrying a sweet potion that was designed to erase all memory of Maelon and turn the prince into a block of ice.God then gave the princess three wishes. She first wished that her prince be thawed. Her second wish was that God meets the hopes and dreams of true lovers. Her final wish was that she should never marry.God granted her these three wishes and as a mark of thanks, she devoted her le to him, becoming a nun and founding a convent on Llanddwyn, located off the west coast of Anglesey. Remains of the church – which had a well named after Dwynwen – can still be seen today. The well and convent became a place of pilgrimage after her death in AD. Visitors believed that the sacred fish or eels in the well could foretell whether the visitors relationship would be happy and whether love and happiness would be theirs..removeShe is also the patron saint of sick and injured animals. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It is a popular celebration among Welsh speakers in the land, but it is becoming more widely popular across Wales, with the people of Wales professing their love to their loved ones in January.Who was St Dwynwen St Dwynwen was a Welsh princess who lived in the fourth century in what we know now as the Brecon Beacons National Park. She is the Welsh patron saint of lovers – despite being quite unlucky in love herself.She was said to be the prettiest of King Brychan Brycheiniog’s  daughters and fell in love with prince Maelon Dafodrill. To her dismay, her father had already arranged for her to marry someone .She was so upset and begged God to make her forget her love. During her sleep, she was visited by an angel carrying a sweet potion that was designed to erase all memory of Maelon and turn the prince into a block of ice.God then gave the princess three wishes. She first wished that her prince be thawed. Her second wish was that God meets the hopes and dreams of true lovers. Her final wish was that she should never marry.God granted her these three wishes and as a mark of thanks, she devoted her le to him, becoming a nun and founding a convent on Llanddwyn, located off the west coast of Anglesey. Remains of the church – which had a well named after Dwynwen – can still be seen today. The well and convent became a place of pilgrimage after her death in AD. Visitors believed that the sacred fish or eels in the well could foretell whether the visitors relationship would be happy and whether love and happiness would be theirs..removeShe is also the patron saint of sick and injured animals. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Following a trip to Belfast from where we were staying in Omagh, we made a stop at Sprucefield, where my husband offered to dispose of the litter – which included the plastic bag, without realising its contents.”Pictured with the jewellery are Danny McErlain, Operations Manager at RiverRidge and Vytautus Skurdauskis.It wasn’t until Kathleen went looking for her jewellery the following morning that she realised it wasn’t in the car. After a frantic search, the couple realised that the jewellery had been thrown out during their stop at Sprucefield.Kathleen continued: “When we realised what had happened, we drove back to Sprucefield to seethere was any chance of retrieving the jewellery but as expected, the bins had been emptied. At this stage, I had lost all hope of ever being reunited with my jewellery collection again.” Staff at Sprucefield helped Kathleen get in touch with the team at RiverRidge.RiverRidge collect waste from all parts of Northern Ireland. In most instances, all waste is processed on the day of collection at one of the company’s three Materials Recovery Facilities, so it is very rare to find anything that someone mistakenly throws away.Senior Commercial Manager at RiverRidge, Pamela Jordan explained: “When I received Kathleen’s email on Monday morning, I knew how distressing this must have been for her. However, given the nature of our business and the large amount of waste we collect, we were unsure about what the outcome would be.“We always try to accommodate as best we can though, and after contacting our Operations Manager at the Mallusk facility, Danny McErlain, the team got to work – literally on their hands and knees seeingany of the jewellery could be recovered.”At this point, Kathleen and Eric had arrived at the ferry port, and were waiting to board the boat for theirto Scotland, resigned to the fact that the jewellery was gone. She said: “I had accepted that the jewellery was lost, and I was devastated. That was until, like ine intervention, I received a call from Pamela telling me that the plastic bag containing my jewellery had been found. I couldn’t believe it, I was elated.“I am so grateful to everyone who helped out along the way – from the team at Sprucefield, to Pamela, and all the team at RiverRidge who went above and beyond to retrieve the jewellery. Everyone was so incredible.“We hear so many stories about unhelpful people and poor customer service, but rarely about the good. On this occasion, nobody could have been more helpful, comforting and reassuring. My sincere thanks to everyone who was involved.”----Read More Read MoreTranslink phasingof timetables as restrictions easeNorthern IrelandFe  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularMasked burglars smash into Glengormley home...NewsBallymena pupil wins car with a ‘touch’ of luck...NewsCourt hears police helicopter deployed to Coleraine to hunt ...NewsIntoxicated ‘air rage’ passenger from Larne struck police of...NewsWeather alert: Storm Malik to hit Armagh, Down, Antrim, Tyro...NewsMost PopularDine in on Valentine’s Day with Morrisons £ meal deal ...RecommendedSmart smoke alarms UK: what do you need to keep your home sa...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.
