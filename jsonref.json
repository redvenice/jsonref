With a turnout of 53 per cent which amounted to 1.2 million people, nearly 67 per cent voted Yes and over 33 per cent voted No.          Ireland held a referendum on the Eighth Amendment of the country’s constitution on May 25It read: ‘The state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.’ This gave equal rights to the mother and the unborn, but did not ban abortion.However, in 1992 in what is referred to as Case X, a 14-year-old girl who fell pregnant after being raped claimed to be suicidal and therefore, a risk to her life and the unborn. She was stopped from travelling to Britain for an abortion and the case sparked debate across Ireland.Three separate referendums were held in November of the same year: the 12th Amendment attempted to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but this was defeated.However, the 13th and 14th Amendments, which meant that women could travel abroad to have terminations and be given information about this, were both passed and added to the constitution.Another referendum was held in 2002, which tried to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but it was ultimately rejected with over 50 per cent voting No.However, in 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Ireland was violating the European Convention of Human Rights because the rules surrounding what is and isn’t a legal abortion were blurred.          A woman lays flowers next to a mural of Savita Halappanavar in Dublin, as Ireland votes In addition to this, the case of Savita Halappanavar also sparked debate around Ireland and the world watched as the Galway dentist died following complications from a septic miscarriage, after she was denied an abortion.In 2013, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was passed which clearly defined what a legal abortion meant. These three scenarios were risk of loss of life from physical illness, risk of loss of life from physical illness in emergency and risk of loss of life from suicide.What is Repeal the 8th?On May 25 2018, Ireland has the opportunity to repeal the country’s abortion law and the Eighth Amendment, to allow the government to legislate terminations.A Yes vote would mean that the text added to the constitution back in 1983 and 1992 would be changed to: ‘Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.’Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Sinn Fein and the Labour Party all support #Repealthe8th. If Ireland votes No, the Eight Amendment will remain.

Princess Michael of Kent (left) prides herself on being both a well-organised and generous hostess. While his wife stands graciously saying ‘hello’ to everyone, Prince Michael minglesThis is the garden that was once Princess Diana’s sanctuary, the only place where she felt entirely secure from Buckingham Palace snoops, and where Prince William took his first public steps.Since taking it over after Diana’s death, Princess Michael, 73, has transformed the place, and the flowerbeds and roses will be at their best for the party on July 2, two days before her husband’s 76th birthday.There is an added ingredient to this summer’s bash — the couple are also celebrating their ruby wedding anniversary on June 30. So there will be special interest in who makes the guest list.The bank holiday getaway heats up! Millions take to the...King and Queen of Belgium join European nobility at the...Share this articleForty years ago, when Prince Michael married orced Catholic Marie Christine von Reibnitz in a civil ceremony in Vienna’s town hall, the witnesses included the groom’s brother Edward, the Duke of Kent, his sister Princess Alexandra, Princess Anne and royal fixer Earl Mountbatten of Burma.The Duke, who is also a Kensington Palace neighbour, and Alexandra are always among the first names on the party guest list.So, too, are their children — George, Earl of St Andrews, Lady Helen Taylor, Lord Nicholas Windsor, and James and Marina Mowatt — who are Prince Michael’s nephews and nieces, but who missed out on invitations to last week’s Windsor Castle wedding.There might also be a dash of glamour from the younger generation, such as the Duke of Kent’s granddaughter, Lady Amelia Windsor.          There might also be a dash of glamour from the younger generation, such as the Duke of Kent’s granddaughter, Lady Amelia WindsorBut what about the newlyweds, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex, who are starting married life in modest Nottingham Cottage, just across from the Michaels’ apartment? Might they attend?And WHAT of Princess Eugenie and her wine merchant fiancé Jack Brooksbank, who have quietly moved into nearby Ivy Cottage, five months ahead of their wedding?What is clear is that the anniversaries, weddings, parties and comings and goings have shone an intriguing spotlight on the palace dubbed the poshest public housing project in Britain, which accommodates an extended family ranging in age from Prince Louis at just 33 days old to the Duke of Kent who is 83 in October.It is ironic that not long after Princess Michael was receiving the key to Diana’s secret garden, the very future of Kensington Palace was in doubt.The Princess’s death, and then that of Princess Margaret in 2002, led to courtiers drawing up a plan to convert the palace into a permanent home for the treasures and artworks of the Royal Collection.The only stumbling block was that it was still a home for those hard-working but minor members of the Royal Family, and where would they go? One possibility was that they could retire to their country homes.The Queen, however, did not welcome the idea of pensioning off loyal family members who do much of the less glamorous royal work without a murmur of complaint. And, besides, none has a country home to retire to any more.The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester gave up Barnwell Manor, in Northamptonshire, because the income from its farm was not enough to meet the upkeep and it was leased to an international antiques company. They do, however, have a small weekend cottage in Gloucestershire.

Last month, Aatish Taseer, ex-boyfriend of the couple’s daughter, Lady Gabriella Windsor, penned a lurid article about their relationship in which he called Kensington Palace ‘wildly depressing’.He added: ‘All the famous inhabitants — Princess Margaret, Princess Diana — were dead, and those who remained, minor royals and palace secretaries, lived in their long, cold shadow. (In perpetual fear, I should add, of being turfed out.)’But instead of being closed down, the palace has flourished. The arrival of Prince William and Kate, who with their three children, now occupy Apartment 1a, the 22-room former home of Princess Margaret following a £4.5 million refurbishment — including two kitchens — mostly at taxpayers’ expense, changed everything.As Taseer wrote: ‘Will and Kate arrived to liven up the place.’ Harry followed, with Meghan moving in with him after their engagement.          In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doorsHow long they will stay in Nottingham Cottage remains to be seen. A modest, two-bedroom dwelling, it was traditionally occupied by royal retainers — home to Princess Margaret’s long-time private secretary Lord Napier, and later Sir Miles Hunt-Davis, Prince Philip’s private secretary.‘Before Meghan arrived, it was like a student or soldier’s digs’, a friend of Prince Harry who visited him there says, simply furnished but with pictures on the walls from the Royal Collection.The young Duchess has changed all that with throws, scatter cushions and scented candles.In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doors.The Gloucesters, said to have made the offer themselves, might in exchange receive the home lived in by Lord (Christopher) Geidt, the Queen’s former private secretary. The father of two, who quit last October, was permitted to remain in his apartment until the end of the school year.          If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9.It is also likely to become the focus of a new royal social salon. A glamorous crowd will be making its way to Kensington Palace.Even so, neither Harry nor William are likely to make it on to Princess Michael’s party guest list.One friend of the Princess says: ‘I asked her how much she saw of Harry and she said she never saw him. That’s the thing about KP, they are cheek by jowl but their lives are separate.‘This explains why the children of the Gloucesters, the Kents and the Michaels, were not invited to Harry and Meghan’s wedding. Even though they all grew up together in the same place, they had totally unconnected lives, different schools, different friends.’There is also the matter of the great stray cats controversy. After two of her treasured pedigree Burmese were injured, Princess Michael called in a pest control firm to trap the strays routinely found in the palace grounds.In one of the traps Diana placed a battery-operated toy cat which miaowed just like the real thing. William and Harry, meanwhile, were taught to shout ‘cat killers!’ at the pest control workmen.The cats weren’t killed, but found homes through the RSPCA. But cats had been a point of conflict between the two women for years.Diana liked to sleep with an open window in summer and Princess Michael’s cats would sometimes climb in and disturb her.On one occasion when Diana phoned to complain, Princess Michael is said to have told an aide: ‘Tell her my cats were here before she was.’In public, the two women were superficially friendly but in private Princess Michael would complain about ‘the stupid girl next door’. For her part, in view of her family’s Nazi past, Diana referred to her as the ‘U-boat commander’.It is also unlikely that Princess Eugenie will be on the party guest list. Princess Michael is no fan of her mother, the Duchess of York.Eugenie, 28, who is an associate director at art gallery Hauser \u0026amp Wirth, and her future husband are privately renting three-bedroom Ivy Cottage, next door to the Duke and Duchess of Kent.A comparable three-bedroom mews house near Hyde Park would cost £3,500 a week. Officials would not say how much the couple have been asked to pay, but it is thought the rent is being met by her father, Prince Andrew.Eugenie had previously been living in a taxpayer-funded four-bedroom apartment in St James’s Palace with her sister Princess Beatrice, 29.Brooksbank, 31, and Eugenie will marry at Windsor Castle in October. The couple have been together for eight years after being introduced by friends in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier, where her parents have a £13 million property.Ivy Cottage was formerly the family home of the deputy director of the palace’s property section. It has been earmarked for Eugenie — though her plans to move in were marred by an alleged row over who should pay the thousands needed to repair a damp problem. It remains unknown whether public money was spent refurbishing the cottage.A source close to Eugenie says she is thrilled to be living next door to Harry and Meghan. ‘Harry and Eugenie are great mates,’ the insider says. ‘She was one of the first of the royals to meet Meghan.’For all the HRHs, the palace residents also include courtiers (who have around 16 per cent of their salary deducted for the privilege) domestic staff and senior military figures. Even members of the public pay the market rent for accommodation, including a cosmetics boss and a City high-flyer. In return, they get armed police security, their own telephone switchboard and a team of craftsmen and gardeners.Among residents are the Queen’s page Barry Mitford, Buckingham Palace foreman and furniture conservator Richard Thompson and senior surveyor Louis Randall. They are all said to get on with their lords and masters.But when your home depends on job security, it can be unsettling.For example, when the late Sir John Riddell was removed as Charles’s private secretary he complained not about his sacking but that his wife had just spent a large sum on made-to-measure curtains they could never use.For the older royals, the new arrivals will mean little change to the rhythms of life at Kensington Palace. But for Princess Michael, it might just be her last summer as the party queen. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/16/4CA5493E00000578-5774789-image-m-31_1527348431493.jpg","title":"Back reality Meghan Markles mother Doria takes dog walk L A","story":"    Doria Ragland was pictured on Friday in Los Angeles as she took her dog for a walk       EXCLUSIVE: Coldstream Guard \u0027raped young mother\u0027 in a park...Prince Charles steps out in a trendy pair of shades as he...Share this articleMs Ragland was also the only one of the actress\u0027s relatives who was seen at the wedding last week. She accompanied her in a car to the chapel at Windsor Castle then watched on, blinking away tears, as Meghan and Harry said their vows.    Ms Ragland returned to California this week after accompanying her daughter throughout the weekend in Windsor           Ms Ragland is one of the few members of the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s family who has not embarrassed her since she became engaged to Prince Harry  Afterwards, in a touching gesture of hospitality after their children tied the knot, Prince Charles accompanied her out of the church and then took her arm on the steps of the chapel to pose for photographs with his own wife, The Duchess of Cornwall. Ms Ragland\u0027s dignified silence about the royal romance is in stark contrast to the headline-grabbing insults thrown around by Meghan\u0027s half-siblings. It also coincides with her father\u0027s staging of paparazzi photographs in Mexico. After the wedding last Saturday, Ms Ragland joined her daughter and hundreds of other guests at a lunch in Windsor Castle.

It\u0027s moving along very nicely. So we\u0027re looking at June 12th in Singapore. That hasn\u0027t changed. So, we\u0027ll see what happens.A White House team will leave as scheduled for Singapore this weekend to prepare for the possible summit, a White House spokeswoman said on Saturday.Moon, who returned to Seoul on Thursday morning after meeting Trump in Washington in an effort to keep the U.S.-North Korea summit on track, said he delivered a message of Trump\u0027s firm resolve to end the hostile relationship with North Korea and pursue bilateral economic cooperation.Trump said in a letter to Kim on Thursday he was cancelling the planned Singapore summit, citing North Korea\u0027s open hostility.The Trump administration has demanded that North Korea completely and irreversibly shut its nuclear weapons program. Kim and Trump\u0027s initial decision to meet followed months of war threats and insults between the leaders over the program.American officials are skeptical that Kim will ever fully abandon his nuclear arsenal, and Moon said North Korea is not yet convinced it can trust security guarantees from the United States.(Reporting by Hyonhee Shin in Seoul and Doina Chiacu in Washington Additional reporting by Josh Smith, Soyoung Kim, Choonsik Yoo and Jeongmin Kim in SEOUL, and Ben Blanchard and Elias Glenn in BEIJING Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan, Paul Tait and Frances Kerry)"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/27/17/4CAC0A1E00000578-5777067-image-a-4_1527439171758.jpg","title":"Gordon Ramsays five bed mansion boathouse taking shape","story":"    Gordon Ramsay\u0027s holiday home is starting to take shape on a plot of land in Cornwall he bought for £4.4million          Walls of the house on the Cornwall seafront are starting to take shape months after the 1920s property was demolished  Ramsay angered some locals when he won planning permission to demolish the 1920s building on the Cornwall coastDespite local objections Ramsay won planning permission in 2016 to demolish the property and build two new houses.Ramsay is also having another smaller property built on the water\u0027s edge, a grass-covered boathouse which will contain a further three bedrooms.The 51-year-old also spent £4million on a \u0027stopgap\u0027 six-bedroom home in the village of Trebetherick, while his nearby holiday retreat is being rebuilt.That property has six bedrooms, four bathrooms, three receptions rooms, a swimming pool, tennis court and almost 2.5 acres of land.  The \u0027supercave\u0027 that can fit four Great Pyramids inside:...Shocking before and after aerial images show how Kilauea...Feet from incineration!

It is not clear whether Abedi bought his materials directly from Amazon or through one of many third-party sellers on the site.But Government sources last night said they want the web giant to alert the security agencies when customers are ‘filling up their baskets’ with bomb-making materials.Abedi’s Amazon history and that of people close to him have formed part of an police and security service investigation lasting months.Female ex-police chief at heart of £870k sexist payout for...How thieves are stealing valuables as you go through airport...Share this articleOne line of inquiry is that he bought one item on the website as far back as January last year – five months before the attack – using the name of a family member.The explosive device has been described as being a relatively sophisticated construct made with nails, nuts and bolts. It was revealed last year that he used hydrogen peroxide to make the explosive TATP – dubbed the Mother of Satan for its instability – and the same as that used in the 77 attacks on London. The Parsons Green attacker, Ahmed Hassan, 18, also used Amazon to make the bomb he left on a crowded London Tube train in September.His trial earlier this year heard how he detonated a device made from TATP, after packing it with metal items bought from Aldi and Asda and had hydrogen peroxide delivered to a friend’s address to avoid suspicion.          Emergency services respond to the attack at the Manchester Arena last year after Abedi had bought chemicals online and detonated the device at an Ariana Grande concertAnother ingredient was bought from Amazon. TATP is typically used by terror groups because it can be made using commonly available chemicals. Along with hydrogen peroxide, which is used in hair dyes, it includes other chemicals which the Mail will not name.Three of the ingredients used to make up TATP were purchased by the Mail on Thursday within minutes without warnings or security checks that may have halted the transaction. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, former head of Nato’s Rapid Reaction Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Battalion, said Amazon needed to step up security checks. He said: ‘For Abedi to be able to buy this stuff on Amazon seems crazy to me. There needs to be more regulation to stop this happening.‘Amazon should really have a role to play in making sure these items are not sold to people who could then fashion a bomb.’Admiral Lord West, a former security minister, said: ‘Surely there are some things where if someone wants to buy them it should flag up a warning. Amazon needs to look at this and monitor what is being bought on its site.’ Former security minister John Hayes said: ‘It is time these companies such as Amazon step up to the mark and put the national interest ahead of any commercial interest.‘They should be encouraged to do and if this doesn’t work they should be made to do so.’Last December David Anderson QC, the former independent reviewer of terror legislation, published a report on the four terrorist attacks in Britain between March to June 2017. He said there needed to be increased cooperation between MI5 and the police and the private sector ‘to improve the detectability and even the preventability of purchases of potential explosives precursors by would-be terrorists, as undertaken before the Manchester and Parson’s Green attacks’.          Abedi’s Amazon history and that of people close to him have formed part of an police and security service investigation lasting monthsAlthough he did not specifically mention Amazon, it is understood the Government is now working with the web giant to help stop attacks using items bought online. As well as using Amazon, Abedi downloaded material from other websites about the chemical compound used in the bomb.And he also watched a bomb-making tutorial on YouTube before the attack. The bomb-making video ‘cookbook’ showed a masked extremist in a kitchen explaining how to build explosives with easy to obtain ingredients.The products Abedi purchased were both legal and widely available. An Amazon spokesman: ‘We share suspicious transaction reports with the Home Office counter terrorism team, but we cannot comment on the specific security measures that we have in place.’Earlier this month it emerged Amazon was selling terrorist recruitment material and bomb-making manuals on its site, including books by Osama Bin Laden. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/28/04/4CB0B5F000000578-5777543-image-a-6_1527476557540.jpg","title":"Hippy squatters Boris Beckers abandoned Majorcan mansion","story":"    Former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker\u0027s one-time Majorcan mansion has been taken oven by a naked hippie squatter after the tennis star abandoned it following his bankruptcy last year           Georg Berres is pictured making himself at home at the villa above. Fifty-year-old former Wimbledon champion Becker is said to have earned in the region of £100million throughout his career          Boris Becker (pictured) was declared bankrupt in June last year over a £3.3million debtHe wrote on Twitter: \u0027Just to be clear: I don\u0027t own any Finca on the beautiful island of Mallorca! Amused by the story myself.\u0027 According to German media, Becker told bankruptcy handlers in London that the villa was sold in July 2016. MailOnline has requested further clarification from his representatives this morning. Hippie Berres, thought to be a 44-year-old former carpenter, has moved into the plush home along with a with a number of helper friends and has wasted no time sharing videos of himself wandering through the palatial grounds and sunbathing.Filming himself walking through the now unkempt grounds, Berres says: \u0027It\u0027s like nobody loved this place.Fresh turf marks spot where poisoned Russian spy and his...My evil ex tortured and killed her au pair because of me:...Share this article\u0027How can it come to this, I ask, that something like this is a habitat for wasps, geckos and spiders.

Berres says he plans to give the empty £13 million villa near the rural town of Arta in north-east Majorca a new lease of life - and claims to have already cut weeds and picked up rubbish around the property along with his hippie commune friends          Berres, who moved to Majorca in 2014 and is understood to have lived in several \u0027abandoned\u0027 houses on the island after time in a caravan, told German press he had \u0027big projects\u0027 for the 31,000-square foot propertyMeanwhile Berres has told newspapers from his home country who visited him that he would leave if the police turned up to tell him to go, although as of today no complaint from the owner of the house is thought to have been received by Civil Guard officers.The retired tennis star purchased his Majorcan villa in 1995 and briefly put it on the market in 2007 for a figure reported to be close 15 million euros - or about £13m - before withdrawing it shortly afterwards.Locals in Arta said last year around the time he was declared bankrupt they hadn\u0027t seen three-times-married Becker for years.  The retired tennis star purchased his Majorcan villa in 1995 and briefly put it on the market in 2007 for a figure reported to be close 15 million euros - or about £13m - before withdrawing it shortly afterwards. Since it\u0027s been abandoned, Berres has enjoyed the palatial surroundings  Berres has told newspapers from his home country who visited him that he would leave if the police turned up to tell him to go, although as of today no complaint from the owner of the house is thought to have been received by Civil Guard officersBecker, who took the tennis world by storm in in 1985 aged just 17 was thought to own the villa - called Son Coll - through a Spanish company. It has nearly been auctioned off twice to pay debts.Becker avoided the scheduled auctioning-off of the property on June 5, 2014, with an eleventh-hour payment to a building firm he owed money to.A court in Palma suspended the auction after the former tennis star paid Palma-based firm Melchor Mascaro the £377,000 he owed for unpaid work including maintenance, plumbing, electricity, carpentry and a new basketball court.The same court had ordered him to pay the money in July 2012 after the building firm sued him. Berres, who moved to Majorca in 2014 and is understood to have lived in several \u0027abandoned\u0027 houses on the island after time in a caravan, told German press he had \u0027big projects\u0027 for the 31,000-square foot property.\u0027It could be a place for meetings, we would like to plant vegetables, offer seminars about renewable energy and other things that interest people,\u0027 he was quoted as saying.In March Berres told Majorcan German language newspaper Mallorca Zeitung: \u0027We do not occupy houses, we save them, we do not make claims to property, we are concerned with nothing other than to live in a rent-free home and give something back to the house.\u0027          Georg Berres, pictured with fellow hippy Stephanie Griesbach, claims he only found out it was the former World No 1 tennis player\u0027s one-time holiday home when German media turned up last week          In March Berres told Majorcan German language newspaper Mallorca Zeitung: \u0027We do not occupy houses, we save them, we do not make claims to property, we are concerned with nothing other than to live in a rent-free home and give something back to the house\u0027He also revealed the creation of an organisation called \u0027Intergalactic Relief and Rescue Commando\u0027, an internet initiative whose aims included occupying abandoned houses and giving them new life. Mr Becker\u0027s financial woes hit the headlines in June 2017 after it was reported that he never paid back an undisclosed debt to a private bank.But in November he insisted that his bankruptcy was a \u0027misunderstanding\u0027, explaining that he was \u0027in a position\u0027 to settle the bill.

It\u0027s a bit like if you go to a restaurant and order a chicken sandwich and a cola and the bill is £10,000.\u0027I\u0027d like to go over the bill with the restaurant owner and that chance hasn\u0027t been given to me. That\u0027s why I call this a big misunderstanding. I\u0027m not running away. I live in the middle of London. I\u0027m not hiding.\u0027  Becker, who took the tennis world by storm in in 1985 aged just 17 is thought to own the villa - called Son Coll - through a Spanish company.

It\u0027s important to me. I could sit it out and say, My doctor is telling me I need a holiday my wife hasn\u0027t seen me much. Theoretically I could do that, but that is the last thing I want to do. To clarify, I want to settle the bill and move on with my life.\u0027The former Wimbledon great explained that he takes \u0027full responsibility\u0027 for his financial situation but had the bank played theoretical tennis \u0027doubles\u0027 with him, he would have avoided his bankruptcy.            A bird\u0027s eye view of the abandoned villa is seen above"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/27/22/4CB0085800000578-5777623-image-a-32_1527456995279.jpg","title":"BBC historian says British Museum Supermarket Sweep","story":"    The British Museum should have a ‘Supermarket Sweep’ where countries have two minutes to take back their artifacts, a BBC historian has suggested.

The current President Sergio Mattarella refused to appoint a eurosceptic finance minister, even though he was the choice of the prime minister-designate and had the backing of the majority of parliamentariansAfter winning elections in 1994, the media magnate, who was already in the crosshairs of the Italian justice system, proposed to president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to nominate his personal lawyer Cesare Previti as Minister of Justice.Scalfaro refused and Berlusconi accepted defeat.This time, the Italian populists have refused to accept that the country\u0027s head of state is simply exercising his prerogative, instead denouncing what they claim is meddling by Brussels or financial lobbyists.It is on this basis that Di Maio has raised the possibility of impeaching Mattarella for treason - something that would require an absolute majority in both chambers of parliament in a joint session.The president has very limited powers but can appoint heads of government and their chosen ministers.The constitution also gives the president the power to dissolve parliament, a deterrent force which has played a part in numerous prior political crises in Italy - a country which has had 64 governments since 1946.During the financial crisis in 2011, when global markets turned on Italy, President Giorgio Napolitano supported a move to oust Silvio Berlusconi and replace him with former European Commissioner Mario Monti.Berlusconi denounced what he said was a state coup and demanded early elections - but in vain.The League and M5S had also called for early elections after Italians voted no in a 2016 referendum on constitutional reform - prompting the departure of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi - but Mattarella refused to dissolve parliament.                                                     \u0027I will come to parliament with a programme that, if I win the vote of confidence, will include a vote on the 2019 budget. Then parliament will be dissolved, with elections at the start of 2019,\u0027 Cottarelli told reporters after meeting Mattarella.But he added that if, as is likely, his government is not approved by parliament, new elections will be held \u0027after August\u0027.He will struggle to gain the approval of parliament with Five Star and the League commanding a majority in both houses.    Giuseppe Conte (pictured) has given Italian President Sergio Mattarella back his mandate to form a government \u0027They\u0027ve replaced a government with a majority with one that won\u0027t obtain one,\u0027 said Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio to supporters at a rally near Rome. A former judge of Italy\u0027s constitutional court, Mattarella has refused to bow to what he saw as \u0027diktats\u0027 from the two parties which he considered contrary to the country\u0027s interests.He had watched for weeks as Five Star and the League set about trying to strike an alliance that would give Italy\u0027s hung parliament a majority.Mattarella said that he has done \u0027everything possible\u0027 to aid the formation of a government, but that an openly eurosceptic economy minister ran against the parties\u0027 joint promise to simply \u0027change Europe for the better from an Italian point of view\u0027.\u0027I asked for the (economy) ministry an authoritative person from the parliamentary majority who is consistent with the government programme... who isn\u0027t seen as a supporter of a line that could probably, or even inevitably, provoke Italy\u0027s exit from the euro,\u0027 Mattarella said.          Mr Conte (pictured) who has no political experience, received the mandate last week from the pro-European Mr Mattarella, but talks failed The president said Conte refused to support \u0027any other solution\u0027 and then, faced with Mattarella\u0027s refusal to approve the choice of Savona, gave up his mandate to be prime minister.The leaders of Five Star and the League, Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini, were infuriated by Mattarella\u0027s refusal to accept Savona, a respected financier and economist.Salvini, who was Savona\u0027s biggest advocate and a fellow eurosceptic, said on Sunday that Italy wasn\u0027t a \u0027colony\u0027, and that \u0027we won\u0027t have Germany tell us what to do\u0027.\u0027Why don\u0027t we just say that in this country it\u0027s pointless that we vote, as the ratings agencies, financial lobbies decide the governments,\u0027 a livid Di Maio said in a video on Facebook.Later on Italian television he called for impeaching Mattarella.\u0027I hope that we can give the floor to Italians as soon as possible, but first we need to clear things up. First the impeachment of Mattarella... then to the polls,\u0027 Di Maio said."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/28/12/4C88CB4100000578-0-image-a-3_1527505633982.jpg","title":"Nicola Sturgeon brands Boris Gove mad Brexiteers","story":"    Nicola Sturgeon held talks Brussels\u0027 chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels today (pictured) where she called for the UK to stay in the EU customs union and single market - flouting the PM\u0027s red lines  Nicola Sturgeon today branded Boris Johnson (LEFT) and Michael Gove (right) \u0027mad Brexiteers\u0027 as she visited Brussels to pour scorn on Theresa May\u0027s exit visionBritish Government\u0027s preparation for a \u0027no deal\u0027 Brexit has...Share this article\u0027Even though these people are not speaking for the majority in terms of (wanting a) hard Brexit.\u0027She also refused to name a single Tory MP that she likes. Ms Sturgeon is calling for the UK to stay in the single market and customs union after Brexit - a move which would undermine Britain\u0027s ability to regain control over its borders and strike free trade deals around the world. The SNP leader said that Brexit \u0027accentuates\u0027 arguments made for the \u0027independence cause\u0027.She added: \u0027Scotland was told in the independence referendum that we face being thrown out of the EU if we voted for it.\u0027We now find ourselves at the exit door.\u0027Scotland should not have to choose between the UK single market and the EU\u0027s, she added. And she warned that she will renew her attempt to hold another independence referendum and tear the UK apart if she does not get her way.Scotland\u0027s First Minister said: \u0027That clarity (on the Brexit deal) will emerge in Autumn - that\u0027s my working assumption.

It will be auctioned on 4 July. In 1814 the theme of peace seemed appropriate as a gift to Canova’s friend John Campbell, aka Lord Cawdor, with Napoleon safely in exile and Europe hoping for tranquility after years of war. The dream was short-lived: in 1815 Napoleon escaped from Elba and launched an attempt to restore his empire.The white marble representation of peace as a beautiful young woman was one of Canova’s Ideal Heads, which were often made as gifts to his friends and patrons. Campbell was both – he introduced Canova to one of his most valuable customers, the sixth duke of Bedford, who commissioned the monumental Three Graces for his mansion at Woburn. In 1994 the Three Graces was acquired jointly by the V\u0026ampA in London and the National Galleries of Scotland after an epic fundraising campaign, aided by a £1m donation from John Paul Getty Jr to keep the sculpture from going to the museum in California founded with his father’s money.Peace had a tranquil life at the Cawdor family mansion, Stackpole Court in Pembrokeshire. Campbell died in 1821, and over the next century, as the house expanded to 150 rooms holding a vast collection, the Canova was forgotten. In a sale in 1962 before the decaying house was demolished after failed attempts to persuade the local authority or the National Trust to take it on, the head was just described as “a white marble bust of a lady wearing a diadem”.The present private owner has spent years researching it, including tracing original surviving correspondence between Canova and Campbell. “It is a very personal piece,” said Christopher Mason, an expert on the period at Sotheby’s. “This is Canova working for himself, without the constraints of having to satisfy the taste of a patron. This is his own vision of the essence of human beauty.”Mason said the sale was exceptionally rare – the last Canova on the market, a rediscovered bust of Joachim Murat, king of Naples from 1807 to 1815, sold last November for €4.3m (£3.8m). “The Bust of Peace has matchless provenance dating back all the way to its conception in 1814, and so we expect a great deal of excitement,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9cd689dc797d42f2f6af05a386896b24e691436/89_995_2160_1296/master/2160.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61714b1775cfe2111459f9598aae61ee","title":"my best summer photograph","story":"The inflatable turtle of Guantánamo, the bed-infested fields of China, the strung-out octopus of the Med … Martin Parr, Joni Sternbach and other top photographers pick their hottest shotby  Dale Berning Sawa,  Imogen Tilden,  Edward Siddons,  Saeed Kamali Dehghan and Tom GrahamKiddie Pool (Gitmo at home, Gitmo at play), 2015, by Debi Cornwall For my first project following a career as a civil rights lawyer, I decided to look at Guantánamo Bay. There are still 40 people detained there. More than 16 years on, many of us have stopped looking. I wanted to make us look again. It took me nine months to secure permission to photograph in the detention centres and across the naval base. Shortly after I arrived, on the first of three trips, my military escort said: “Gitmo is the best posting a soldier could have. There’s so much fun here.” It was such a striking statement. So I decided to juxtapose the so-called fun of the guards’ spaces with the facilities available to prisoners. When I saw this wide-eyed smirking turtle, I knew it was perfect: the water shot I’d been looking for, an inflatable toy in a wading pool. Until I saw it, I hadn’t realised that there are children growing up on the base, their parents being either in the military or civilians working there. What must it be like to grow up there? To use the leisure facilities of a place seen as a “war-on-terror” prison site, where men are held without charge or trial, largely beyond the reach of the US courts, for years at a time? There are two very different things happening at Guantánamo and this captured that perfectly.I understand why people say it’s a scary image. There’s that expression on the turtle’s face, in this run-down enclosure, and there’s the sliver of sky, the palm trees in the distance, the lush green – but you’re not out in that tropical paradise. You’re penned off from it. What gives the shot extra power is the fact that it’s the only face in my entire series. Military regulations forbid any photographs of faces. This forced me to be more creative, to find other ways to convey the denial of personhood of Guantánamo Bay. My shots capture all the places people use – but they’re empty. DBSSt Michael’s Mount, 2017, by Martin ParrMagnumI shot this at St Michael’s Mount, just near Penzance, last August. It was a hot day, though not blazing sunshine. St Michael’s Mount is a big honey pot, absolutely mobbed every single day, and part of the manifestation of that mobbing is this wonderful queue. The British, of course, are supreme masters of queuing. And I thought it was good to get summer, beach, queuing and the island in the background, all in one photo.I watched the queue for a good period. I love how it winds round, constantly shifting. It was actually very difficult to capture it without lots of other people getting in the way. Here, I managed to get just a few scattered people “off queue”, with the rest compliantly queueing up to get the boat over to the island.I never actually got there myself, because I was too fascinated by people trying to get there. Despite global austerity, tourism is growing at a phenomenal rate. We all know the stories about places like Venice and Barcelona being almost out of control. DBSAncient tree (After Night series), 2010, by Lisa RossThe first time I ever saw a bed just sitting out in the landscape was while I was travelling through Xinjiang, an autonomous region in the far northwest of China, in a taxi. I screamed at the driver to stop so I could take a photo. I was transfixed. It was only when I returned a few days later that I realised they were everywhere. I just hadn’t noticed.Xinjiang gets extremely hot in summer so everyone sleeps outside. There are beds all over the fields, on rooftops and in front of houses. In towns, there are whole streets have beds out front. Each bed becomes a hub for the family. They eat around them and kids play on them with their friends.The bedding is rolled up during the day to keep the sand out, but when you see it unfurled it’s extraordinary. Bedding is a big wedding gift in the region, so it’s often made from the most colourful fabrics available. People couldn’t understand why I was so interested. When I asked if I could photograph their beds, they laughed. It’s just such an ordinary thing to do there.It’s the total opposite of how we treat the bed in the west. For us, the bedroom is a private space, intimate and enclosed. It’s usually the last room you’d show a guest. Here, though, it becomes a part of public life. People talk and play and see each other around their beds.This local custom has lasted longer than anyone can remember, but I don’t know if it will survive. Xinjiang is home to Uighurs, a Muslim minority who are under increasing surveillance from the Chinese government. When I first started working here, I encountered relatively few difficulties. But today, nobody knows what might be considered unacceptable. That’s why I try to keep people’s faces out of the pictures. It might cause them problems further down the line.I showed these photos to a Tibetan friend and he was amazed. He felt like it was the last uncontrolled area of China. There will probably come a time when this custom is banned. In a really important way, the beds are an expression of their autonomy, and it’s the heat of summer that brings everyone out into the open. ESI love the way New York used to look, but the city has become so corporate and homogenised. Coney Island, though, still has a cool edge. You find everyone there: tourists, locals, immigrants from Mexico, Africa, Russia. Everyone loves the magic of being on the beach in New York City! For my series Island, which I shot over the summer of 2016, I avoided any kind of landmark, though. I didn’t even include the Island’s famous Wonder Wheel. I just wanted to concentrate on the people. I saw this guy playing with his son, chasing him, throwing him in the air – and the boy, who was two or three, was loving it. The interaction between them was special. The boy’s mum was there too – it was a family day out.I asked if I could shoot them and suggested this position. Having seen they way they were together, I knew they’d be comfortable with it. The kid was laughing and giggling the whole time. It made me think about childhood, how early experiences and memories imprint themselves on us for life. I only took a few shots. It was the end of the day, when the light is soft and the blues and the yellows are strong.The father had had a tough life. That tattoo was one of several. I loved this image but he took a while to come round to it. I had to persuade him to let me publish and exhibit it because he was protective of his son. There was a really strong reaction to it. African Americans particularly like this positive image of a black father – something that we don’t see enough of. I love how the father’s face looks a certain way, but the overall image shows him as a gentle and loving father.I always talk to the people I photograph. I want to connect with them. In my work, I try to show that compassion and inclusivity are what’s important. ITThe Roof of Tehran, 2016, by Tahmineh MonzaviI took this at Bam-e-Tehran, which means “the roof of Tehran”. It is in the foothills of the Alborz mountains, close to the cable cars that take you up to Tochal ski resort. It’s essentially a plateau, enclosed by a wall made of bluish-green stone. It’s just 50cm high on the inside, but on the other side is a sheer drop. You can walk up there, along a pedestrianised road that leads to shops and restaurants. Young people gather there all year round, to sit on the wall and look out over the city. You can see all of Tehran from up there. I live close by, but had never paid it much attention until this one evening in 2016. I was working on images of Tehran for Elle magazine. It was about 7pm and the sun was setting. It wasn’t rainy but it was overcast. Tehran has four seasons and spring is the best. The weather is great and the city is magnificent. If you’re not from Iran, you might mistake this for somewhere in Egypt or Beirut. But people who live in Tehran would easily recognise the architecture, the tall and short buildings.In my work, I focus a lot on Iranians, women in particular. I try to document their lives. Gathered on the wall, I could see people of all social backgrounds: those from the lower-class neighbourhoods of south Tehran more middle-class people from the centre affluent ones from the north. Despite the chaos and the pollution, Tehranis have a huge passion for their city – and they all come together at Bam-e-Tehran. SKDFourth of July, High School Students, New Orleans, 2017, by An-my LêI moved to the US as a child and have always been struck by Independence Day: the barbecues, the lawn chairs, the flags, the parades, the people out in the street. In 2017 I was in the south, photographing confederate monuments that had recently been taken down. With Fourth of July celebrations in full swing, I thought I would find some interesting parades.We had started in Memphis, then drove further south but couldn’t find any good parades in Mississippi. So we headed to New Orleans. A lot of people had gathered in St John, a bayou within the city, to boat down the waterway or picnic on its banks. Walking around at the end of the day, as the sun was setting, I came across these incredible young women.What I noticed first was the redhead’s hair, that extraordinary colour, and then the African American girl sitting next to her, so regal. I thought of Manet’s Déjeuner sur l’herbe – this was an interesting alternate version. The image feels staged and deliberate, partly because I used a large-format camera. The longer exposure means I had to ask them to hold still. But there is also something about the way they were presenting themselves. I didn’t direct them much. The redhead was just standing that way.While I made this photograph before the shootings, it is a sort of a response to what happened at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, this year. At first glance, these three girls couldn’t seem more different, yet they are together, in that Fourth of July chaos. I wanted to capture the intimacy I sensed between them. DBSUntitled 3 (Estudio elemental del levante), 2017, by Ricardo CasesI shot this outside a restaurant in Dénia, on the Mediterranean coast of Spain. I was struck by the composition: the tentacles hanging down, the line of the sea going across. The locals hang octopus in the sun to dry, before serving it with a little olive oil and lemon. It’s a simple, traditional dish, not unique to the region, but ancient.On the Costa Blanca, beyond the paella and the parasols, there are so many symbols, things that carry the spirit of the place. This drying octopus is one, but so are the oranges, the palm trees, the village brass bands. And together, they form the basis of a series I’ve made about degradation in the area.On the beaches and coves of Costa Blanca not long ago, there were fishing villages, steeped in tradition. Now the old way of life has been engulfed by resorts. And with those resorts have come real problems. You can see scorched and withered palm trees everywhere. Many were imported from Egypt to decorate tourist developments during the real estate boom. But they carried the red palm weevil, the larvae of which have since devoured thousands of trees. They were eaten from within.This image of the octopus is another note in a requiem for a way of life that had its moment of delirious crazy glory, but is now sickly and decaying. It marks the end of a stage in Spain’s recent history, a moment lived with intensity and ingenuity, but one that couldn’t last. TGRicardo Cases’s solo show, Estudio elemental del levante, is at Espace JB, Geneva, until 22 June.Timeout II: LAX, USA, 2016, by Marcus LyonThis is a montage of over 1,000 images brought together in my studio. I shot them by hanging out of a chopper 1,000 metres above Los Angeles international airport early one summer morning. The work is part of a series that explores the five big preoccupations people have once safety, shelter and sustenance have taken a secondary role. These are sport, mass entertainment, cars, food consumption and mass air travel.I tried to visualise it first, sketching an airport with gates and runways that looked like a living organism with a spine and ribs. I then spent hours searching for the best airport and a pilot happy to seek permission from the control tower – and take the doors off his helicopter. One of the advantages of shooting over airports is that the air space above them is just about the most uncrowded on the planet – because all the planes are on the ground.We were in the air shooting for about two hours. I knew exactly what shots I needed. Seen from up high, the world dissolves into minutiae, patterns and rhythms. I have spent a lot of my time hanging out of helicopters so I’m much too focused on what I’m doing to stop and think about it enough to be terrified.Back in my studio, I worked for three months creating the final image, one car, one airplane at a time. It was a painstaking process. And there’s a little image of me in there – I put myself in every shot I create. It feels honest, plus it means that kids love to engage with the work. Hopefully, it will help them ask the right questions about their roles in our increasingly globalised world. ITSurfers in a barrel, 2017, by Joni SternbachWhen a big wave hits shallow water, its tip can curve right over and form a tunnel through the water. In the surfing world, this is known as a barrel. So when I saw this huge wooden structure, I thought putting a few surfers in it was probably the best pun I’d ever come up with. We were all beside ourselves laughing.At first, I had no idea how the barrel got there. The shot was taken right next to a parking lot on the California coast and there was junk strewn everywhere. Someone told me after the shoot that it was a prop in the film Sideways. I don’t know if that’s true – but it’s what I like to tell people.I’ve been shooting surfers on the California coast for over a decade now. I’m fascinated by the human connection to water. The ocean is one of the few places that doesn’t have boundaries these days. Even the ranchers who live on the surrounding hills have been enclosed and hemmed in. The sea is still free.But I can’t shoot surfers in action. I work with tintypes, a process that creates an image directly on to a thin tin plate using lacquers and emulsion that react to the light. The plate needs a long exposure, so I can’t catch people riding the waves.Using such an old process gives my shots their timeless quality, an air of nostalgia. But it also forces you to work in a really communal way. I have to set up a darkroom. People have to stay in position for a little while – and I develop the photos in front of them. They see the result there and then, telling me what they think. It can be quite nerve-racking, but it’s much more participatory.Only two of the people in this photograph knew each other. But the surf – and posing for this image – brought them together. I think that’s what summer by the sea means to me: people coming together and new communities forming, even if only for a day. ESJoni Sternbach’s solo show, Ocean Side, is at Galerie Catherine et André Hug, Paris, until 9 June.Ice lolly in the Tenderloin, 2015, by Pieter HugoI was living in San Francisco in the summer of 2015 when one day my wife called as she was dropping our daughter off at school. She told me I had to go downtown and take a look at the Tenderloin district. It’s an island of anarchy in the midst of the city’s tech boom. Most of the buildings are owned by non-profits who have no interest in selling their space to the tech giants.It’s a crazy place: if you wander through its streets, you’ll see people openly shooting up in the middle of the day. Having spent most of my life in Cape Town, South Africa, I’m used to homelessness. But what I saw in the Tenderloin was something else.In many ways, its residents are testament to the failings of American society, whether that’s people suffering under a failed healthcare policy or veterans traumatised by wars overseas. It can be pretty rough – especially at night – but there’s an extremely strong sense of community. This was the very first shot I took. When I asked if I could take her portrait, the woman immediately struck this pose, as if she was modelling. I met her a lot over the course of the summer. Every time, it was like a fashion shoot. She would ask for cash and I would usually give it to her, but we never really talked about her life story. What I love about the photograph is its oomph. She owns it.

In a military town outside Seoul, where she lived aged 11, many of the trees had been cut down for fuel, while, under the dictator Park Chung-Hee’s modernisation programme, new roads were begun and abandoned. The inhabitants of her neighbourhood’s cheap and fragile houses came and went: soldiers, farmers who worked the fields surrounding the haphazard development, and “wanderers”, such as Bul’s parents. They were leftwing activists whose home was routinely searched by the police for banned books and needed to live in a place where people weren’t too fussy about their neighbours.While the world outside was dry, however, home was a Technicolor Oz. As political dissidents, her parents couldn’t attend group gatherings, even at work. Compelled to labour from home, sometimes with neighbours, her mother made handbags from glass beads. “There was another landscape inside our house,” she recalls. “One room with women working with beautiful colours.”As origin stories go, it’s a setting worthy of the dystopian fiction Bul has long channelled in her art: sci-fi movie-spectacular sculptures and installations powered by utopian dreams and social critique. Her forthcoming mid-career survey at the Hayward Gallery in London will trace how, over the past three decades, she has established herself at the forefront of South Korean art. When we meet at the gallery a few weeks before the opening, there are cyborg babes and multi-limbed monsters hanging from the ceiling. Mirrors wrapped in cellophane lean against walls, waiting to be assembled into luminous labyrinths. Technicians are tinkering inside a high-gloss black hunk of hollow mountain that looks like a panic room for Darth Vader, but is dedicated to the Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin. Throughout it all, Bul examines our flawed pursuit of perfection, be it improving our bodies, or remaking society. There’s a striking push and pull between the gorgeous and grotesque. Get up close to the darkly glittering skin of a mutant octopus creation, and you see that its sequins are matted with plant life, like something washed up in a drain.Bul thinks the strange contrasts of her formative years are central to her approach they have clearly engendered a strong ironic streak in her work. She has a formative childhood memory of lovers riding a motorbike that crashed into a bakery, in a smash of blood and cake. “That was a beautiful accident,” she laughs throatily.Her work is now highly crafted, with expensive production values. It’s a universe away from when she started out. This was 1980s Korea, where protesters faced torture, and she was working within a fledgling contemporary art scene with few international influences. “There were no role models. I had to create,” she says.Her traditional art school was a disappointment, but discovering the postwar theatre of the absurd inspired Bul to break free. Her first notable work was in 1989 a performance called Abortion, a shocking mix of real and fake. Having distributed sweets to her audience, Bul hung upside down and nude, recounting her experiences of abortion, which was then illegal, while recreating something of its physical agony. Eventually, her onlookers took action and cut the ropes: “They never thought it was theatre. It was a real body and a real situation.”The following year she took her unruly, boundary-breaking physicality to the street. Hanging from the Hayward’s rafters is a meaty, lobster-orange mutant fat suit, fingers and limbs sprouting from its fleshy folds. It’s huge – photographs can’t really convey what it must have taken the diminutive artist to don it, take a flight to Tokyo, and head downtown. “Of course, they didn’t want me on the plane,” she chuckles. “Finally, they said it’s too big and I would need two seats.” What impressed Bul, though, was how, in Tokyo, when prohibited from entering a temple because of the suit, a crowd had argued for her right to wear what she wanted: “They were thinking about human rights. It expanded my subject.” Bul’s body politics and her insistence on her presence as a woman seem especially remarkable in a society as notoriously patriarchal as Korea’s: until 2005, men were legally heads of households. However, she says that her own experiences were not so bad, for one particular reason. “People were scared of me and thought I was a crazy woman. Of course, if I didn’t use this character, then it would probably have been very difficult.” She adds, “I know so many great women artists in Korea because, when women want to be an artist they have to sacrifice everything. It’s art alone for them, so they are very, very strong.” It was after Majestic Splendor that Bul began to think about the cyborgs that would really establish her as an international star. In the 1990s they were a hot topic for writers such as William Gibson and a strong presence in manga, as cartoonishly sexualised women. Bul was one of the first to pull these creatures of sci-fi subculture into contemporary art, in a way that pointed to their age-old cultural roots. Bul’s floating marble-white cyborgs have the elevated position and missing limbs of classical sculptures, a nod to our shifting ideals of beauty and imperfection. What really fascinated her, though, was what cyborgs implied about our efforts to self-improve, in this case with technology. Thinking back to Frankenstein’s monster, she says: “We try to pursue perfection, fail, get scared and call it a monster. And still we try, because that’s our human destiny.” Bul refers to her many-tendrilled Anagram sculptures, a mash-up of insect, plant and sea-life resembling a genetic experiment gone badly wrong, as her voluptuous cyborg’s “doppelgangers”.As a child in the military town, from her house with a paper-thin door, Bul would dream about a bunker-like hideout on a mountainside. In recent years, her focus has shifted from the body to the built environment – another kind of protective skin. This includes fashioning glittering chandelier-like sculptures inspired by the modernist architect Bruno Taut’s fantasy mountaintop glass buildings and coffin-like, one-person karaoke pods that recall the 1960s architecture collective Archigram’s Living Pod. These failed or unrealised architectural dreams are a not-so distant echo of the rapid urban development South Korea was subjected to under the dictatorship, Bul says, with “fast-built cement structures and clean surfaces, but which were likely to collapse”. Disaster is never far away in her work, such as a new installation that refers to the 2014 sinking of the Sewol ferry, in which hundreds died. Yet Bul says she doesn’t want to criticise the impulse to dream big. “This is all about human desire, and desire is our destiny. I don’t want to judge it, but I want to see it more clearly if possible.”Bul’s work knowingly embraces the human urge to attempt impossible tasks. First, there’s the relentless drive to perfect the world, even as history teaches us such ambitions are doomed. Then there’s the challenge of understanding why we do it. One particularly telling work, Via Negative II, is inspired by psychologist Julian Jaynes, who proposed that early man misinterpreted thoughts from the right side of the brain as voices from the gods. It’s a mirrored maze where you encounter infinite reflections of yourself. “I’m trying to question the modern human with a modern mind, and I can’t find the answer,” Bul says. “My labyrinth is in two halves. In one, it’s hard to exit. The other is always open. You can escape any time. That’s my dream.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b7760f8b292b8cce7b8b50390fb93a70ffd21a8/0_229_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed470c60461134dc7aff20c37a782f6a","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"Demonstrations in Gaza, the eruptions of Kilauea volcano, the royal wedding in Windsor and Harvey Weinstein in court – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc9911d0b183a021c35ad38589be3f1572a0657/0_0_4275_2565/master/4275.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abe2e81432659992da04a80506be6544","title":"gavin francis picks five books on human transformation","story":"The doctor and author recommends some of his favourite books that provide personal and profound insights into pregnancy, the menopause and genderOur bodies and minds are in ceaseless transformation and I’ve spent the last few years writing about how that flux both sustains and lends dynamism to human life. It’s a message that can feel like a curse or a consolation: if things are going well, they won’t stay that way for long if things are going badly hold tight – change is just around the corner. In my work as a doctor it’s the consolations I emphasise – people come to my clinic in the hope of influencing a change in their lives. That change may be modest and routine, or urgent and dramatic, but inevitably it is a perennial source of hope.Many books have helped me navigate transformation’s personal, social and cultural territory. Some nudged me towards a more intimate understanding of those way stations of life I’ll never undergo, such as pregnancy or the menopause. For the former, I reached for Chitra Ramaswamy’s Expecting: across nine chapters she charts her burgeoning pregnancy. Of the linea nigra, the black line that develops down the front of the belly during pregnancy, she writes: “It bisected my stomach like a ring around a planet or a veined streak of quartz encircling a pebble, evidence of a disturbance within. Some mysterious ancient change.”To understand more about the menopause I was recommended Ursula K Le Guin’s The Space Crone – the first essay in her collection Dancing at the Edge of the World: Thoughts on Words, Women, Places. It is panoramic in scope but beautifully concise. Le Guin proposed that women become more comfortable with accepting the third stage in their lives: “The woman who is willing to make that change must become pregnant with herself, at last.” Women in the third stage of life, she said, have experienced more fully what it is to be human than any other group, having “acted the entire human condition – the essential quality of which is Change”.Changes in mental experience are another kind of transformation, from dreaming and memory to hallucination and psychosis, and mental illness may effect dramatic bodily change. Anorexia may be as baffling and frustrating for those who suffer it as it is for therapists trying to help – it has the highest death rate of any mental illness. To better comprehend its complexity I recommend Katy Waldman’s extraordinary Slate essay There Once Was a Girl. “I starved,” wrote Waldman, “to acquire that old classical capability: metamorphosis.”Feeling uncomfortable in your birth gender is another issue that brings some to the clinic, seeking prescriptions for oestrogen or testosterone. Maggie Nelson’s poetic memoir The Argonauts points out that we are all in continuous transition, irrespective of gender: “On the inside, we were two human animals undergoing transformation beside each other, bearing each other loose witness.” She quotes her transitioning partner’s impatience with the idea that anyone taking hormones must be on a journey to one binary extreme or the other: “I’m not on my way anywhere.”Some of the transformations I’ve been examining have been crises: cancer, hormonal imbalance, fracture, amputation. I met with Olivia Giles, who lost both hands and both feet to septicaemia, and whose charity 500 miles provides low-cost prosthetic limbs to amputees in Malawi and Zambia. Giles told me “the most transformative thing about prosthetic limbs is the potential they offer for children. You can see it in the mothers’ faces when the new limbs are fitted they know their child has a future.” And transformation is one of the most ancient and resonant themes in literature and art: two thousand years ago in Metamorphoses, the Latin poet Ovid painted nature and mankind as a seething maelstrom of flux. Marina Warner’s Fantastic Metamorphoses, Other Worlds maps this cultural topography since Ovid, showing how stories of change can guide us through the perils of life. “It would be stupid to suggest stories invariably enlighten,” Warner says, “but stories do offer a way of imagining alternatives, mapping possibilities, exciting hope, warding off danger by forestalling it, casting spells of order on the unknown ahead.” At its best, the same could be said of medicine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2288f424011b7a59631d96b740bf9fb117426ae1/428_1129_4326_2596/master/4326.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d855517b5f21ea103a50b36eefe703c1","title":"joy and despair in alaska adam weymouth on his 2000 mile odyssey","story":"Weymouth spent months paddling through the wilderness in a canoe, tracking the mighty king salmon. What he found was an ecosystem – and a culture – under threatThe sun is shining on the rear deck of Adam Weymouth’s barge, and the hawthorn along the banks of the river Lea is bright with new growth. But despite the natural beauty all around him in this pocket of London, he’s finding it hard to believe we can avert climate catastrophe: “It’s just really hard to give a fuck.”“Living where we do, even with the best will in the world and being as informed as you could be, nature is incredibly abstract,” Weymouth says. “When the shit hits the fan, we’re going to turn up the air conditioning. The bread might get a bit more expensive, but we’ll be all right for quite a while.”This disconnect between our comfortable urban existence and the havoc it is wreaking on the environment propelled Weymouth into the far north of the Americas to paddle 2,000 miles through the wilderness by canoe on the trail of the salmon who swim through his lyrical debut book, Kings of the Yukon.“The Arctic is heating twice as fast as other places on the planet, and those changes are much more obvious,” he says. “You’ll meet a lot of people in Alaska who question why climate change is happening, but you won’t meet anyone who believes the climate is not changing, because it’s very manifest.” Alaska is also home to the most productive oilfield in America, Weymouth says, with few alternative sources of income: “It’s a very stark way of looking at what feels much more obscured in London.”Every spring the king salmon – the biggest of the five species of Pacific salmon – swim up the Yukon to spawn in the waters of their birth. But a deadly mixture of ocean warming, early melts and commercial fishing has sent numbers crashing. Weymouth set out from the furthest end of their journey, Canada’s McNeil Lake, heading down towards the sea and the approaching salmon over tumbling rapids and winding flats, past spruce forests and grizzly bears. On the way he met First Nations elders who are wrestling with decisions about how many of the threatened fish they should catch, settlers from Maryland who are rebuilding after catastrophic floods and biologists struggling to understand the king salmon’s precipitous decline.The global shifts driving all these changes are all too familiar for Weymouth. Born in Salisbury in 1984, he spent most of his 20s as an environmental activist, working with groups like Plane Stupid. In 2009, a plan to shut down the coal-fired power station at Ratcliffe-on-Soar saw him arrested alongside 113 others. His conviction for conspiracy to commit aggravated trespass was quashed two years later, after it emerged the prosecution had failed to disclose evidence from the undercover policeman Mark Kennedy, but he was already beginning to move away from direct action.“It felt like really important work,” Weymouth says, “but it was only nourishing one part of what I wanted to be doing. The writing and the thinking and the other parts of why I’d become interested in human ecology and the environment were falling by the wayside.” Not only did campaigning take up a huge amount of his time and energy, it was emotionally draining. “There’s a real exhausting cynicism about the world and its future that people almost get high on. It’s like a relationship that’s turned toxic – it’s hard to see any joy in it any more.”A narrowboat in London was a halfway house from which Weymouth could launch into freelance journalism, a route which saw him travel to Alaska in 2013, looking for stories about natural resources. He wound up reporting on the trial of 23 Yu’pik fishermen who had defied a ban on catching king salmon. As the salmon population crashed and restrictions were extended to cover the whole of the Yukon for the first time, Weymouth hatched a plan to travel the length of the river by canoe, charting how the changes in the environment are affecting the fish and the people who depend on them.This slow journey, always coming from the nearest town upriver and heading to the next downstream, gave Weymouth a way of making connections with the people he met along the way, and helped break down barriers to communication.“There isn’t a fantastic relationship between white people and indigenous people in the north of Canada and Alaska,” he says, “for very good reasons. Generally, the white people turning up are teachers or cops or some sort of government official, and generally with some sort of authority they’re quite keen on using.”As he paddled down towards the sea, Weymouth discovered the fate of the king salmon in Alaska is “very much in the balance”.The situation for the salmon may be critical, Weymouth says, but alongside the modern loss of biological ersity is also an extinction of culture that has received much less attention. “Why should people not be part of that ecosystem, why is the culture not part of what we’re trying to value and keep?” A lot of British nature writing seems “deliberately apolitical”, he says. “If people are brought in at all, it might be 18th-century poets who might have written about the landscape, rather than the people who were cleared off it or the people trying to make a living on it now.”“Finding a balance between the joy and that despair is very important,” he says. He lifts his gaze to the sunshine rippling across the glinting surface of the canal. “It’s a very easy way to burn yourself out, just thinking that everything is fucked.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/533b1b6f4c7e96a713c6761abfdb8706a6692787/0_400_7165_4301/master/7165.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd79eab3be623b6fc77005583299d46e","title":"kayo chingonyi poet dylan thomas prize","story":"The winner of the Dylan Thomas prize explains how his poems are infused with the rhythms and rhymes of garage, grime and hip-hopWhen Kayo Chingonyi was awarded the £30,000 Dylan Thomas prize for his debut poetry collection, Kumukanda, he used his acceptance speech to thank some of his former school teachers, including one who had given him a copy of Thomas’s play for voices Under Milk Wood. “I was very grateful for that, it led me to Thomas’s poetry,” Chingonyi says he was delighted and surprised to have come out ahead of fellow shortlisted authors including Sally Rooney and Gwendoline Riley for the prize awarded to writers aged 39 or under, the age Thomas was when he died. “I was also grateful that these teachers shared their enthusiasms with me. A lot of what I write is embedded in my wanting to share enthusiasms.”The enthusiasm that most obviously animates Kumukanda is music, specifically garage, grime and hip-hop. Chingonyi thrillingly integrates their rhythms and rhymes with more conventional poetic metrics – there is even a sonnet – in a collection that tackles race, identity, masculinity, migration, bereavement and longing, not to mention literary tradition, with a rare energy, intelligence and sophistication. The influence of Eminem is probed alongside that of Pinter and Lowell, as Kumukanda cuts through sterile delineations of page or stage by simply privileging excellence in language and literature, whatever its source.“The most formalist poetry I have been exposed to is rap lyrics,” Chingonyi explains. “They are hyper-metrical, the rhyme schemes are intricate and the levels of allusion, and allusive play, in the average rap song is staggering. When you put that against the work of more canonical poets I think there is a lot of kinship between people driven by an affinity with, and flair for, language.” He is particularly moved by those forms which unite story with song. “My work is always trying to achieve a balance between the written and oral traditions of literature, and so it makes sense to bring together traditional canonical poetic forms with forms which are a part of their own canon, to create a canon of my own.”Some of the bare facts of Chingonyi’s life can be glimpsed in Kumukanda. He was born in Zambia in 1987 and moved to the UK when he was six after his father died. He lived in Newcastle, London and Essex and his mother died when he was just 13. He was an avid collector of music on cassette and fancied himself as a rapper: “K to the a to the y to the o,  lyrical G with a badboy flow” as the teenage Chingonyi announces in “Self-Portrait as a Garage Emcee”. “But I resist the idea that the poems are my story in any authoritative way,” he says. “The poems are drawn from certain influences and experiences, but the act of creativity is to ask how can I move beyond that into sharing with someone a text or a poem that encourages them to reflect on certain things in their own life. And when I enter into that kind of conversation, with a reader or someone in an audience, then the poem really lives in that it has a life outside of my life.”The primary theme of the book is presented in the title poem. Kumukanda is an initiation ritual for young men of the Luvale people in Zambia. Chingonyi says he first heard about it in conversations with an aunt which “opened up a space in my work to write about this feeling of loss which attends moving from one place to another. When I was thinking about this book and what type of poems I wanted to put out in the world, I kept coming back to this theme and found myself writing into it and out of it.”He says missing out on the ritual served as a metaphor for other things that he had missed from a culture which was part of his life, but was remote this led him to consider the events that had moved him “across that threshold into the adult world”.“The death of parents is something that makes people grow up sooner than they otherwise would expect,” he says. “But there are other ways. Black men are particularly racialised and some of the ways they are viewed prejudicially prompt moments of having to grow up quickly. As a kid I was never in trouble with the police, but certain interactions with them were fraught because of stereotypical notions held on both sides. Those were moments where I had to learn to carry myself in a certain way, which was not the way a child should be learning to carry himself. There have been many things that stood in for that singular moment of initiation.”Chingonyi is currently writing poems for a second collection but says he’s in no rush. “Kumukanda only came out a year ago and it still feels like early days. I’m also working on some essays that deal with notions of autobiography, cultural criticism, music, migration and other issues that sit in the middle of my life.” He will take up a post as an assistant professor at Durham university in the autumn, where he will teach creative writing as well as doing his own research. “I like it that I can participate in conversations within institutional and academic spaces, but also participate in events in the wider world. I’m looking forward to the opportunity to draw on that hybrid sensibility.” In his early writing he says music and poetry felt like separate enterprises, but he is now consciously working to integrate them. His route to poetry came through memorising song lyrics and he wants to continue to explore the powerful allure of rhythm and rhyme.“There is something about the compression of poems, and songs, that encourages you to memorise them and take them with you into the world. The best become wonderful travel companions for life.”Since I haven’t danced among my fellow initiates,following a looped procession from woods at the edgeof a village, Tata’s people would think me unfinished – a child who never sloughed off the childish estateto cross the river boys of our tribe must crossin order to die and come back grown.I was raised in a strange land, by small increments:when I bathed my mother the days she was too weak,when auntie broke the news and I chose a yellow suitand white shoes to dress my mother’s body,at the grave-side when the man I almost grew to calldad, though we both needed a hug, shook my hand.If my alternate self, who never left, could see mewhat would he make of these literary pretensions,this need to speak with a tongue that isn’t mine?Would he be strange to me as I to him, frowning as he greets me in the language of my father and my father’s father and my father’s father’s father?• Kumukanda is published by Chatto.

It has slashed staff numbers, which leads to poor standards and service”.The company has recently been criticised for accidentally pricing toothpaste at £7.99 in one of its hospital outlets and been accused of feeding Britain’s obesity problems by offering bargain chocolate at the till. It also had to change its policy to provide VAT refunds for shoppers travelling outside the EU from British airports after criticism for failing to pass on savings.Bryan Roberts, the insights director for TCC Global, said WH Smith’s tactic of incentivising staff to sell shoppers extra chocolate bars, take coupons for McDonald’s or encourage them to use automated tills is not shopper-friendly.“If you are an investor then WH Smith is one of the best retailers in the country its share price performance and profitability are a huge success,” he said. “But a lot of its practices don’t sit well with customer service.”A WH Smith spokesperson said: “Only 184 people commented on WH Smith as part of this survey. We serve 12 million customers each week and despite a challenging retail environment we continue to open new shops, and to maintain our presence on the UK high street.” In recent years the company has spent millions of pounds on refurbishing its stores, including about half the high street estate. Even WHS_Carpet has acknowledged that it is getting harder to find examples of grimy or damaged flooring, although they say more staff are needed to help care for stores and customers.“There’s still a lot of affection for the brand – it just needs to live up to it,” they added.This year, the organic beauty specialist Lush, the cut-price health and beauty chain Savers and the toy chain Smyths shared equal billing as the nation’s best retailer. They knocked last year’s top two, Toolstation and Richer Sounds, down to fourth and sixth place respectively.John Lewis, which finished joint third in 2017, falls to 10th place – its worst ranking since the annual survey launched in 2010. Ben Clissitt, the Which? magazine editor, said: “It is clear that our traditional high street is changing and while this is bad news for some retailers who have struggled to adapt, others have seized the opportunity to make their mark.“Our findings show that if retailers can strike the right balance between good value, quality products and first-class customer service, shoppers will keep coming back to their stores.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d85c9dd1efd98d63e39ac1131df624a69565db3d/0_243_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6915ec2cb5a1d9a0f7917c4bbf170c90","title":"galileo space eu satellite brexit microcosm","story":"A row over the UK’s access to the Galileo project, the European satellite global-positioning system used both for civil and military purposes, is the latest tussle about what Brexit would mean for British science and technology. For all the familiar, rhetorical huffing and puffing, the dispute is another illustration of the myriad small-print complexities that need to be resolved if the UK departs from the EU.For the EU the position seems quite clear. The UK agreed previously to restrictions on access to sensitive, secure data from Galileo for countries outside the EU, so why should it expect to become an exception? This is just another example of the “let’s just keep everything we have now” fantasy that one senior EU official recently lamented.Needless to say, your response to this tiff will depend on your sympathies to Brexit generally: either “what on earth – or in space – did we expect?”, or “why is Brussels being so bloody-minded?” Either way, it is rather late in the day to be discovering yet another stumbling block. In a paper published in March, the House of Commons committee on science and technology expressed exasperation at the government’s dilatory attitude towards the complications of the many science-related EU programmes and agreements in which the UK has been embedded. In its Panglossian document Collaboration on science and innovation last September, the government expressed eternal optimism that all could be resolved while offering very little indication of how that might happen.On Galileo that document said little more than, in effect: “Our people have helped develop it and we’re really good at space, so we hope you’ll let us carry on as before.” It pointed out that there are currently negotiations with Norway and the US for access to the crucial public regulated service (PRS) from Galileo, the encrypted signal designed for security activities. Indeed there are, but nothing is yet agreed.Another point of contention is the EU’s Copernicus satellite network for monitoring of the natural environment, which will collect important data on climate change, natural disasters and ecosystems such as fish stocks. Here too the future of UK involvement is unclear – and is complicated by the fact that Copernicus is partly funded by the European Space Agency (ESA). Because ESA operates independently of the EU, the UK would remain a member after Brexit.In short, it’s getting very messy, and the clock keeps ticking. The UK space agency, though, is in a rather bullish mood in the wake of the recent Space Industries Act, which establishes a regulatory framework for all kinds of new space initiatives including the building of launch sites on UK soil. Two sites are already planned, in Cornwall and Scotland. Private space-industry companies are springing up everywhere, and while it’s doubtful that the UK could achieve very much in space by itself, its continuing role in ESA, along with hoped-for collaborations with the US and Australia (which announced a new $26m space agency earlier this month), are helping to create the impression of a boom time for British astronautics. No wonder Tim Peake’s six-month stint on the International Space Station is being milked for all the publicity value it’s worth.In one view, Brexit creates an opportunity to unfurl the UK’s space ambitions on a wider platform. In another, jeopardising the potential markets in Europe, at such a crucial moment, while hyping vague plans to do space deals with nations on the other side of the planet, looks insane.And this, of course, is Brexit in microcosm, as doubtless played out also on countless other commercial and industrial stages across the sectors. Once again it seems that the only way we’ll have our cake and eat it is by baking our own."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/054b9ddff5f68911dba6124ff654c90b43c2443c/0_0_5753_3451/master/5753.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7147ff1e820de8873a1ca081e509a05f","title":"news journalism politics democrats republicans","story":"I launched a local paper to hold power to account, even when those in power lean as far left as I doThe problem I have with liberals in government is the same as the problem I have with conservatives: they’re human.Allow me to explain.I live in East Lansing, Michigan, a city so blue that our public library has a social justice reading group – for preschoolers. Our police chief is on good terms with the ACLU. Our high school recently designated all-gender bathrooms with unanimous support of the school board, and our Islamic Center hosted a citywide “Go Solar!” event. When the online news site I publish for East Lansing was considering a satire edition for April Fools’ Day, one of my reporters suggested the headline: “Last Republican in East Lansing captured, tagged, and moved to safe breeding population in Grand Rapids.”I am not that “last Republican in East Lansing”. I consistently vote Democratic, donate only to left-of-center candidates, and work nationally on sexual and reproductive rights. So why did I bother to start a non-partisan local news organization for East Lansing? Why do I push my neighbors to use the Freedom of Information Act to look into our local government’s doings? Why do I constantly irritate my city council with investigative reporting?About a decade ago, my historic neighborhood was facing the possibility of a giant commercial development being built just down the hill from us by a company known to have a troubled history. Worried about our way of life, the president of my neighborhood association and I started going to city council meetings.Watching our city government came as something of a shock. While the policies were consistently liberal – in favor of the arts, the environment, and the unions – the behaviors were troubling. We saw cronyism, unmanaged conflicts of interest, and a general attitude that citizens are at best naive bores.At that time, we had no dedicated news organization to keep the people of East Lansing informed – to provide the transparency and accountability that the press ideally does. In a one-party town like East Lansing, a “news desert” is especially dangerous. But in our town, as all over America, the internet had gutted the local news economy, leaving us thirsting.So I did something I never thought I’d do. I used my skills as a professional historian and mainstream writer to become a local investigative reporter. Then, in 2014, I assembled a board and created a foundation to bring in donations from our community to provide news, hiring regular citizens and teaching them how to be local reporters. That neighborhood president I teamed up with a decade ago? Today, Ann Nichols is the managing editor of our organization, East Lansing Info. We’ve had 110 citizens report for us so far.Ann is a diehard progressive, like me. Yet we both have become fierce advocates of non-partisan news. That’s because, watching our city council, Ann and I could see the same thing: when people get elected to serve in government, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, independent or Green, they tend to be human, not heroic. Liberals, like conservatives, assume they will govern differently once in power. They will drain the swamps, represent the little people, spend public money only in just and reasonable ways! What really happens?Pattern No 1: elected officials believe in ethics until someone they like breaks the rules. We had one member of council who repeatedly advocated for her business from her council chair. That’s not only unethical, it’s illegal. She also took thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from developers and landlords and voted on their financial business without disclosing those payments before the votes, as required by a law that very council had passed. But did anyone on council hold her to the rules? Nope. We had to report on it. (She was voted out of office.)Pattern No 2: elected officials also honestly believe, when they run for office, that they will finally bring transparency to government. But once in, they quickly discover that they’d rather not tell the people everything. Doing so – particularly when controversial decisions haven’t yet been hammered out – just complicates their lives.Just about every week, we must use the Freedom of Information Act (Foia) to get documents that should be readily available. I recently had to make a formal Foia request to obtain a copy of a handout our city manager gave to city council. This was his draft of the city’s “strategic priorities” for the coming year. On the list of his strategic priorities: open and transparent government. Pattern No 3: government accountability? Here again, Democrats are as Republicans. As soon as the oath of office is administered, they seem to become incapable of admitting mistakes, especially those of their own party. As we face a $200m debt (mostly pensions) in a city with only 20,000 year-round residents, our council has taken up the mantra: “Now is not the time to worry about blame now is the time for solutions.” Me, I happen to think a little blame helps prevent more mistakes.Pattern No 4: And then there’s the cronyism problem. True graft is relatively rare I’ve not seen it in my city. But what we see every day is how people in power take care of the people to whom they feel some loyalty. This is where it feels impossible to bust in as an average citizen and have any meaningful say in the decisions being made. Those decisions – which in our town can involve a tax deal worth $50m arranged by the mayor for friends – are being made at tables to which we are not invited.When Ann and I look at our city council, our state legislature, and Congress, what we see are not dramas of good and evil. What we see is the tragedy of human nature. American government is full of a lot of well-intended people making a lot of self-serving decisions. It’s no different with liberals or conservatives.There are real policy differences between liberals and conservatives. Voting still matters. But what I’ve come to believe matters much more than my vote is giving people high-quality, non-partisan news. This is news that doesn’t take sides – that requires us to try to rise above our loyalties, to try to cancel out each other’s biases in the collaborative reporting and editing process. Because if there is any hope of getting citizens to demand accountability, transparency, equal treatment, and ethical behavior from their governments, the way to get there is to show them whenever anyone is behaving in a troubling way. I see far too little of this in journalism today, as the internet economy rewards outraged clicks, not genuinely uncomfortable news – news that makes us doubt our assumptions and loyalties.The founding fathers knew what they were doing when they put protections for the press in the first amendment. What we need even more than citizen participation in politics is to get people involved in non-partisan news – as readers, as donors, and as producers. It’s the only way to ensure liberals might see the problems with liberals, conservatives might see the problems with conservatives, and everyone might see we are all so annoyingly human."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc0d8fa734cd255d81bb3a1895ea1711ca94b90f/71_0_2813_1688/master/2813.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e05809756da1a4fd82cd4c0c6b5462e","title":"union leader maryam pougetoux france hijab","story":"“She wears a particular veil that covers all her hair, the neck: a hijab”. Last Tuesday on French TV two men – a pundit, Thomas Legrand, and celebrity host, Yann Barthès – described in detail a woman’s outfit before labelling it “the opposite of feminism”. Few people in France appeared surprised. For the past two weeks the hijab has once more been at the centre of a national debate that has verged on hysteria.It all started on 12 May when the political scientist Laurent Bouvet, known for his activism and sometimes referred to as a “gladiator of secularism”, published on his Facebook page an image taken from a televised interview with the elected president of the Sorbonne branch of the national student union (Unef), Maryam Pougetoux. The interview was about student protests against government reforms, but Bouvet’s attention was caught not by Pougetoux’s comments but by the hijab that surrounds her face.The reaction on social media was immediate. On Facebook, the prominent socialist Julien Dray said: “As a founding member of Unef … the union leadership that approves this young woman as a leader defiles all the struggles we led in the universities.”The minister of the interior, Gérard Collomb, joined in, describing Pougetoux’s appearance as “shocking” and referring to “young people that can fall for Daesh’s thesis”. The cyberbullying that followed has included publication of Pougetoux’s telephone number.The satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo put a caricature on the front page, giving her ape-like, coarse features. The overpowering impression is of a woman’s politics and achievements completely overwhelmed by her physical appearance.So what did Pougetoux do wrong? She dared to wear a religious symbol while being a union leader. Bouvet asserted that he was simply observing an inconsistency: “How is it possible simultaneously to defend progressivefeminist principles (contraception, abortion, marriage for everyone …) and ostentatiously display religious belief?” It is striking how many people seem willing to judge the choice to wear a scarf while hearing nothing from Pougetoux herself. How can one interpret the meaning of a garment without asking the opinion of the women who wear it?She had some defenders, too, in a debate that completely took over the airwaves. La République En Marche MP Aurélien Taché, himself a former Unef leader, said “I believe it’s up to the students to choose their representative and that they don’t need us for that.”The controversy came just a few weeks after another row about a Muslim woman, the first veiled candidate on the French version of the television singing competition The Voice, Mennel Ibtissem. The discovery of Facebook posts in which Ibtissem had appeared to question whether the 2016 Nice lorry attack, in which 86 people were killed, should be classified as terrorism, led to her withdrawal.My point is not to defend these comments. But the fact is that for three decades now, controversy around the headscarf in France has been never-ending: visibly Muslim women have again and again been singled out for criticism, denied their own agency or intellect, and prevented from engaging in public life. As the furore around Maryam Pougetoux shows, France is stuck in an identity crisis, unable to recognise all its citizens and apparently frightened of its own multicultural reflection.• Rokhaya Diallo is a writer, journalist, film director and activist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d5a568fee6bd1c033ca631fc219cc839767069a/239_142_4455_2673/master/4455.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45387d53bb215260ef12e002ae2c69d4","title":"museum film moving image deal kent cinema","story":"Kent Museum of the Moving Image crams ‘35,000 years’ of culture into two-storey houseBehind a domestic front door in a narrow street in the Kent seaside town of Deal, a museum is celebrating two centuries of cinema – or, as the founders insist, 35,000 years. “The history of cinema is the history of the moving image, and that goes back to flickering shadows on the walls of painted caves,” said Prof Joss Marsh, one of the co-founders.Deal does not have a cinema but the hunger for the moving image is palpable. The museum’s exhibits include cameras, posters, props, original artwork, as well as moving images created by 200-year-old optical toys before film was invented. The museum is the creation of the renowned film archivist David Francis and his wife, Marsh, a historian of popular culture.The artefacts, acquired over a lifetime of collecting, borrowing and skip ing, include a priceless hoard of Ealing Studio posters salvaged on its way to the dump.This is the third – and, he promises, final – film museum created by Francis, who was awarded an OBE in 1982. In the 1980s he was a lead member of the team behind the Museum of the Moving Image, part of the British Film Institute (BFI) complex on the South Bank in London, which opened in 1988 and closed for redevelopment in 1999. That museum’s future has been mired in planning and funding disputes, and this year the BFI dropped plans to construct a £130m headquarters. Meanwhile, Francis moved to the US where he became archivist of the enormous film collection at the Library of Congress. The research institute, which began as a conservation store for the potentially explosive vintage film stock, is home to more than 6m items relating to the moving image.Marsh and Francis met in the US and, after touring magic lantern shows and carrying crates of glass slides and a vintage projector in the back of their car, they moved to Kent, where Marsh had family connections. The pair envisaged a quite life but instead they became visiting fellows at the University of Kent. Since then, they say, every spare minute of the past two years has been spent buying, building and populating the new museum, which occupies two floors of a small house. Marsh and Francis are out of space but have continued to collect rare artefacts, with some items – including a billboard film poster – extending beyond the display cases and into the floor space.For the museum’s opening, Marsh and Francis created a collage of film clips, including from FW Murnau’s 1922 classic Nosferatu and Orson Welles smouldering in the 1949 film noir The Third Man.They expected visitors would glance at it and move on to the main displays. Instead most were transfixed, so the pair have added a row of chairs and are looking for a suitable site nearby to convert into a cinema.“We saw this as our retirement project – but now, you never know,” Francis said. “I’m afraid I am a serial retiree.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/733cea149f8b9016a6615858a8757b8fa6e50838/0_0_6200_3721/master/6200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d545afc0c2a2cb7830de9d772321fcb","title":"revealed developers cashing in privatisation uk student housing","story":"More than 20,000 UK students are paying for rooms owned by companies based offshoreTens of thousands of undergraduates are paying for accommodation at universities where developers are cashing in on the privatisation of student housing using offshore companies, a  investigation has found.More than 20,000 students are paying for rooms owned by companies based in places such as Jersey, Guernsey, the British Virgin Islands and Luxembourg but that figure is likely to be an underestimate given the surge in building in university towns in recent years.The holding structure means that overseas investors are able to sell on the rooms without paying tax on their gains and it allows buildings to change hands without any stamp duty bill. Complex company arrangements also give companies the opportunity to minimise the tax they pay while charging students up to £14,000 a year in fees for high-end housing.One company collected £2.2m in rental income in 2016 but contributed just £10,000 in income tax after it paid £2.1m in charges, mostly to a Luxembourg based holding company.For residential property the only real advantage is anonymity - rules introduced in recent years mean that you will pay more tax to put a home into an offshore company, and face an annual fee to if the property is worth more than £500,000. But for commercial properties there are still benefits - overseas investors can sell properties held in offshore companies without triggering a UK capital gains tax (CGT) bill. And purpose-built student accommodation qualifies as commercial property.Buying a building directly will trigger a stamp duty land tax bill, but if you buy the shares in a company that owns a commercial property, you will escape the tax. If the company is in a country with no tax on share purchases, even better. On a building costing £25m the potential saving is £1m.They are. The 2017 budget included a consultation on bringing offshore companies into CGT, and the plan is to do that in April 2019. The consultation issued in November suggested that gains made prior to that date will not count - calculations will be based on the value of properties on 1 April 2019 and it will only be future gains that are taxed.Possibly not - the main advantages will have disappeared, and owning property via a UK company is pretty straightforward. However, if they are holding properties in a number of different countries they may still see a practical value to not using a UK company.The structures are perfectly legal, but MPs and students criticised their use.John Mann, a Labour MP and member of the Treasury select committee, said: “Students are squeezed enough without paying high rents to offshore companies. It is a disgrace that offshore companies are maximising their gain from UK students whilst minimising their tax liability here.“That this is perfectly legal demonstrates exactly why parliament needs to thoroughly examine issues of tax avoidance, evasion and offshoring.”The student accommodation industry has been transformed in recent years as universities have turned to private developers to provide accommodation.One study estimated the market to be worth £45bn and billions of pounds worth of deals were done in 2017 alone. Investors from all over the world have snapped up student properties in England and Wales including big pension funds, foreign states and wealthy iniduals.Those that bought companies holding buildings, rather than buying properties directly, will not have had to pay any stamp duty land tax.Analysis of Land Registry data and company accounts show many developments are owned by investors through companies or funds set up abroad. found developments all over England and Wales – including London, Exeter, Newcastle, Chester and Bristol.Holding a property offshore currently allows overseas investors to sell on properties without a UK tax bill on their profits. This is due to change in April 2019, although any gains made before then are expected to be ignored and not subject to tax.Complex structures involving large loans and charges also allow investors to minimise the profits they pay tax on and make gains on sales without facing any bill from HMRC.Investors may own whole blocks or, in some cases, snap up inidual rooms with the promise of high returns. For instance, among the owners of one student block in Newcastle are companies based in jurisdictions including United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.Investors paid about £100,000 for each room, with students charged upwards of £135 a week to live there.Accounts for the UK manager of the Courtrooms, a Student Housing Company block in Bristol where students pay £161 a week for an en-suite single room, show that in 2016 it collected a rental income of £2.2m and paid £10,000 in income tax. The bill was reduced by charges of almost £2.1m, the bulk of which were payments to Unicity XV Bristol Sarl, a Luxembourg company registered as the owner of the property.A spokesperson said: “We are a responsible business whose revenue and operations are taken into account when calculating profits on which we pay tax.”Analysis by the  found more than 100 student apartment blocks around England and Wales owned by different offshore companies, with the actual number likely to be higher as there is no clear way to identify student properties in the records.Land Registry listings cover only England and Wales, and some blocks are described as “land”, or another type of building, because that is what the developer purchased before converting into student rooms.Owners are liable for UK tax on the rents they collect from students, but can receive the money before tax and reduce the amount they have to pay by offsetting expenses and debt repayments.One big investor is GSA, which in partnership with Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund owns 13 buildings around the country managed by the Student Housing Company. The buildings are owned by separate Luxembourg companies.Millions of pounds in rent is collected by UK companies that then pass on payments to Luxembourg. The Luxembourg companies charge high costs for managing the buildings, allowing the firm to reduce the tax it pays.The National Union of Students vice-president for welfare, Izzy Lenga, said UK students were seen as a cash cow by overseas investors, and often had no choice but to take rooms in “overpriced glass towers”.Lenga said: “Overseas investors make billions of pounds building luxury apartments and charging sky-high rents for students. There is a cost of living crisis and finding good-quality affordable accommodation is a huge barrier for low- and middle-income students attending our world-leading institutions.”Additional reporting by Sunniva Kolostyak"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48c98c6d495d25c15f9369b4a68b1d21b332701a/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fa1490e72b6cdb07d11f36e047b433f","title":"huge rise in food redistribution to people in need across uk","story":"One in eight people in the UK go hungry every day – with the most needy increasingly dependent on food banks – yet perfectly good food is wasted every day through the food production supply chain.FareShare said it was now redistributing food that otherwise would have been wasted with an annual value of £28.7m, up from £22.4m last year. “Three years ago we were helping to feed 211,000 people a week – today it’s three-quarters of a million,” said FareShare’s chief executive, Lindsay Boswell. “We reported in 2015 that we provided food across 320 towns and cities – now it’s 1,500. It’s not rocket science to see there has been a massive hike in demand for food from frontline charities.”FareShare currently redistributes about 13,500 tonnes of surplus food every year donated by supermarkets, wholesalers and suppliers to 9,653 charities including hospices, homeless shelters, care homes and women’s refuges, but its annual target is 100,000 tonnes. Demand for surplus food has soared against a background of growing dependence on food banks and rising homelessness in the UK.FareShare says it has the capacity – and a waiting list of charities wanting help – but needs access to more food. Its solution is a government fund that would cover the costs of storage and transport. Available to any charity or producer that incurs the costs of redistributing food, it would also save charities and other beneficiaries £150m by making free food available to them. A public petition supporting this move attracted more than 16,000 signatures, which guarantees a government response. “Food poverty can happen to anyone, and it can happen quickly,” said Boswell. “The 10,000 charities we support provide food to people who have lost their homes, left the armed forces and struggled to adjust, escaped violent relationships, fallen into drug or alcohol misuse or simply can no longer cook for themselves.”City Harvest, the largest of the London-based food redistribution charities delivers more than 15 tonnes of food each week. Founded in 2014, it focuses on the “last mile” between a shop or event and charity, and has so far redistributed 900 tonnes of food waste, creating 2.1m meals for vulnerable people in London. It also takes food from major wholesalers such as New Covent Garden Market and Western International.City Harvest chief executive, Laura Winningham, said: “We work in tandem with Fareshare who have been extremely supportive of our food rescue work. We are collecting this year from the Chelsea flower show. The food donated last year was fantastic. Surplus is often dictated by the weather and last year in the sunshine people browsed the garden exhibits more and ate less so vulnerable people across London ate extremely well when we redistributed the surplus.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/259e4d0ef83d4e90f2cc4c2b7268445d9cb40935/0_0_2000_2586/master/2000.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ffa67f5cb736ff62b312b902e54e6d1 880w","title":"mohamed salah confident fit world cup","story":"Jürgen Klopp will make a renewed attempt to prise the goalkeeper Alisson from Roma this summer as he looks to upgrade Liverpool’s squad following defeat in the Champions League final.While Liverpool players refused to blame the “infinitely sorry” Loris Karius for defeat against Real Madrid in Kiev, with Dejan Lovren appealing for criticism of the 24-year-old to be restrained, their manager has already made plans to sign a new first-choice goalkeeper for next season.Alisson, Liverpool’s opponent in the Champions League semi-final, remains Klopp’s favoured choice with the Brazilian scouted extensively throughout the season.Roma, however, have been resistant to dialogue with Liverpool this year and it will require a considerable offer to test the Italian club’s resolve. Alisson’s employers have also been scarred by internal criticism for selling Mohamed Salah to Liverpool last summer for £36.9m. There were fears that the Egypt international could miss the World Cup with the shoulder injury that changed the complexion of the final although he tweeted on Sunday night that he is “confident” he will be available.Jan Oblak of Atlético Madrid has also been linked with Anfield but Klopp was prepared to persist with Karius after his £4.7m signing from Mainz responded well to being confirmed Liverpool’s No 1 ahead of Simon Mignolet. But that was the position prior to the aberrations that contributed to the 3-1 defeat in Ukraine. The Liverpool manager insisted he and his club “will be with” Karius as he comes to terms with the errors that enabled Real Madrid to record a third consecutive Champions League triumph. He may have to broaden his search for a new first choice keeper should Roma maintain their stance on Alisson.Klopp’s plans for midfield improvement are in place with Naby Keïta secured for £52.75m from Red Bull Leipzig and Lyon captain Nabil Fekir targeted for a transfer costing a minimum of £60m. Klopp will be armed with a sizeable transfer budget having made around £70m for reaching the Champions League final and banked £142m from the January sale of Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona.Karius was inconsolable after the final on Saturday and apologised to Liverpool fans and team-mates for his two mistakes. On Sunday he extended his apology on social media. “I know I messed it up with the two mistakes and let you all down,” the goalkeeper wrote. “Haven’t really slept until now. The scenes are still running through my head again and again. I’m infinitely sorry to my team-mates, for you fans, and for all the staff. I’d just like to turn back the time but that’s not possible.”Liverpool players were criticised for not consoling the young German keeper immediately after the final whistle but there was only support for Karius afterwards.Lovren said: “When we win, we win together. When we lose, we lose together. Don’t blame him. It’s easy to blame someone but we are in the same ship together and everyone gave him the best words that they can. He will come back strong. You cannot find the words. He had a difficult start last season, so I believe in him. Don’t make massive stories about that. Of course it’s big because it’s a final, but everyone makes mistakes.”Andy Robertson had a similar message for the Liverpool keeper. “We win as a team, we lose as a team and we fell short,” the Scottish full-back said. “Of course he made mistakes but we are not blaming him. He has been incredible since he got the number one jersey. He is young and he will learn from it. He will be a top, top keeper. We have fallen short and there are no words that we can say to Loz that will make it better for him.”Robertson was one of many Liverpool players in Kiev who insisted that Salah’s cruel exit after 30 minutes, and not Karius’s mistakes, was the true turning point of the final. He also suggested, diplomatically as possible, that there was an element of intent behind Sergio Ramos’s prolonged hold on Liverpool’s leading goalscorer.“I think it is just how Mo has landed but Ramos is quite clever, isn’t he?” said Robertson, rhetorically. “It is just the way he has landed on it. It disrupted our rhythm a wee bit. Everyone looks because it is Mo Salah. He has done unbelievable this season and for it to end that way for him was devastating.”Lovren concurred: “We are devastated, it’s heartbreaking. Mo is one of the most important players for us and it’s not the same when you don’t have him on the pitch. The mindset is totally different when you have him on the pitch. It was difficult to accept that we, again, had such an unlucky moment with so many injuries. I cannot believe we had so many injuries this season.”The Liverpool captain, Jordan Henderson, described his second defeat in a European final for the club as “the worst feeling I have had in football”. But he was adamant the consistent progress Liverpool have made under Klopp would not be disrupted by the latest setback and silverware under the German coach will materialise.“I believe we will be in another Champions League final,” Henderson said. “I believe we will be challenging in all competitions domestically. The Premier League is important to us and we are qualified for the Champions League next year so we need to do it sooner rather than later. I believe in this team, I believe in this manager and I believe we are going in the right direction. It is so difficult to stand here now and say that but that is the truth. It is how I feel. We have to make it happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05e2fca881b875a10a33e8d0c7203ffd1c7ff494/780_134_1601_961/master/1601.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42a6d07afa7138032cd9e282fc5068c6","title":"andreas brehme picks his all time germany xi","story":"The former left-back and 1990 World Cup winner picks his best XI from Germany line-ups down the years. Now you can do the same with our interactive toolIt is very hard to compare players of different generations, almost impossible. Tactics, equipment, rules – so many things have changed. Manuel Neuer and Oliver Kahn have shaped goalkeeping as well as Sepp Maier. Nevertheless, I think that Maier is the best of his guild in Germany and he’s my goalkeeper. He was a clown on and off the field. But in the game he was always fully focused and concentrated.With all respect for players such as Pelé, Johan Cruyff, Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, for me Franz Beckenbauer continues to be the best player in the world of all time. He has united all attributes you must have to have success. And nobody is as complete as he was as a football player. Franz was perfect in everything he did. That’s why people worldwide still recall the name Beckenbaur when asked about football in Germany. Mats Hummels reminds me a lot of him. The way he is leading the defence with Bayern and the national team, so calm and composed, impresses me so much. And he is even getting better from game to game, so he joins Beckenbauer in central defence. Talking about intelligence on the field nobody can mess with Philipp Lahm. He has proved for years that the body does not imply how assertive a player is. All top stars have tried to crack this nut. Lahm nearly always stayed victorious with fair means. As Lahm had such a perfect sense of tactics he was the extended arm of the coach too. The same counts for Paul Breitner, my other full-back. I can’t remember any bad pass when playing with him. He was “Mr. Zuverlässig” (Mr Reliable) and he always made the right decision in the right situation.Coming to the midfielders, it’s really a hard choice. Germany have had so many outstanding players in this position. During my career, I’ve played often against Pierre Littbarski. He was a painful opponent, because you never knew which way he was going in the next second. His dribbling was unpredictable and he surprised me again and again, so he is in. Lothar Matthäus has characterised an era with his style of playing. For me he is not far behind Beckenbauer in terms of fame worldwide. The football fans around the world still know Matthäus. When it comes to strikers there is no getting around Gerd Müller. I don’t need to talk a lot about our “Bomber of the Nation”. He scored when there was no chance to score. Out of nothing. Again and again. Really impressive. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge is a strong character as CEO of FC Bayern and he was as a player too. A natural born leader. With his strong body he commands respect. It was nearly impossible to beat him in aerial battles. And his finishing skills were perfect. Finally I choose Rudi Völler as third striker. He set standards in terms of fighting spirit and commitment. And on top of that Rudi was a real gentleman. Young players of today should take a leaf out of his book."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a71baee31be175ee108f68c0cafc836dc368604/53_141_4436_2662/master/4436.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43a07051c7b106b8bbf3bcf84bb50f55","title":"cristiano ronaldo future real madrid champions league final","story":"Real Madrid’s president, Florentino Pérez, said we had heard it all before but we had not, not quite like this. Sergio Ramos had not even collected the European Cup, their third in a row, when Cristiano Ronaldo referred to it in the past – to all of it. “It was nice to be at Madrid,” he said, standing pitchside at the Olympic Stadium, Kiev. Was? “In a few days I will give a response to the fans, because they have always been at my side.” And so a historic moment shifted. The night had yet another narrative.A few minutes earlier a pitch invader had stood between Ronaldo and a goal in the final, which might have helped to bring some of the sentiment to the surface but this, he later admitted, had been brewing for much longer: “When you hold on and hold on, when you have a heart and you’re honest, sometimes you lose control.” The stress on “have” as he stood by the pitch revealed that, while fans have supported him, others have not. There was a reflection of that desire for affection in the remark made by Sergio Ramos shortly after. Literally, it translates as: “Cris likes to let him himself be loved,” and it implies a want, a need, a call for attention, for appreciation.Back in Madrid, at the statue of Cibeles where they celebrate titles, he got that. There were chants of “Ronaldo, stay!” But while the fans’ relationship with him has not always been perfect, when it comes to those whose support he has missed, Ronaldo was thinking principally of Pérez, and it was Pérez who responded. “Now is not the time for inidual issues the club is more important than anyone,” he said.What came next was even more pointed. “I am glad he has five European Cups, like me.” And then he said it: “The same thing is heard every summer and then nothing happens.” They had not expected to hear it now, in the midst of celebration. They also did not expect to hear something similar from Gareth Bale, although that did feel different, Zinedine Zidane saying: “I understand him.”Ronaldo had just won his fourth European Cup with Real Madrid, his fifth in total. This is their fourth in five years. Luka Modric likened it to the Bulls, the Lakers and the Celtics, basketball teams that established a dynasty. “Now you can call this a dynasty too.”Marcelo called it a “special night” but now he was forced to field different questions. They all were. In the post-match press conference Zidane shrugged: “What do you want me to say? I can’t change what he said. But now it’s important to enjoy the moment.”By the time Ronaldo appeared again it was past 1am and that message had clearly been conveyed to him as well. “The timing was not ideal,” he conceded. He insisted he did not want to sully the moment for his team-mates, “the real champions here”, and the contrition seemed genuine. But he was not backing down.Things a little like this have come out before, which is what Pérez was getting at. He did not sign Ronaldo but rather inherited a done deal and the relationship has not always been good. Ronaldo has publicly said he was “sad” before, he had felt alone at Fifa galas, during his legal battle with the Spanish tax authorities, and there have been difficulties over contract renewals. One theory is that the pursuit of Neymar has not helped, just as it did not help when Pérez once told Ronaldo that he could go if he brought them money to sign Messi instead.Before Ronaldo last renewed his contract, negotiations had often appeared at breaking point. A year ago A Bola, a Portuguese sports newspaper, claimed he wanted to leave. Ronaldo never denied it but almost three months later he did remind people that the words were not actually his. These words were. “I cannot guarantee I will be at Madrid next season.” He was swift to insist this was not about money – nor jealousy. “I have five Champions leagues, five Ballon d’Ors, I’ve been top scorer six years in a row. Who am I going to be jealous of?”Madrid know how important he is – or the players do, anyway, and so does Zidane – but at some point the club know they will have to confront a post-Cristiano Ronaldo era. His position has ramifications for Bale, too the departure of one may help prevent the departure of the other. The question embarking on a new era is when and how. Ronaldo is 33 and Pérez is not averse to starting now but Ronaldo has accelerated since he turned 30, becoming more effective than ever.“I know what I give the club,” Ronaldo insisted. Others, he feels, perhaps do not.This has a long way to go, even if in the next few days he does, as promised, make an announcement and even if that does reveal a determination to depart, with everything that implies. Or if he announces a change of heart, a rapprochement. It might be that nothing happens, just as Pérez claimed, but this cannot play out quite like those other times we have not heard this before.“Where would you be better off than here?” Ronaldo was asked. “Difficult,” he said. “This is the best club in the world but life is not all about glory.”No, but the moment was supposed to be. It was almost 3am when Ramos left the stadium. He dashed past journalists waiting for a word – about the final, about history, about Mohamed Salah, about Bale’s goal, now of course about Ronaldo. He hurried past, grinned, winked and nodded at the huge trophy he carried in his hands, as if to say this is all that matters. And on Saturday night in Kiev it should have been."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c9ca6628c895e6122af371aa8c1a56b99638629/0_301_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab604f9697f245970c201af7198b34a4","title":"west ham winners sunderland losers womens football super league","story":"A mixture of anger and joy greeted the Football Association’s revelation of its redrawn women’s league pyramid on Monday morning when West Ham United emerged as the biggest winners and Sunderland the greatest losers.If catapulting West Ham from the third tier into next season’s newly all-professional, 11-team Women’s Super League is bold and controversial, so is the decision to demote Sunderland two isions after refusing to allow them to retain their place in the top flight.As expected, a newly formed Manchester United will join the predominantly part-time 12-team second tier, rebranded as the Championship from last season’s WSL2.This revamp follows the FA’s restructure of the women’s leagues and involved clubs having to reapply for their places late last year, before a second, open application phase began in March. Its conclusion has led to Charlton, Leicester City, Lewes and Sheffield United also joining the expanded second tier but left Southampton, Crystal Palace and Derby County disappointed by the failure of their bids.According to FA sources emotions are “running high” at a few clubs whose applications for the remaining places on offer in the top two isions were rejected.Sunderland are foremost among them. Quite apart from Melanie Copeland’s side finishing a creditable seventh in the WSL1 – which will now be known simply as the WSL – the club have historically played an integral part in the wider development of the English women’s game, producing a wealth of England internationals. They will now almost certainly drop two rungs of the ladder, to the Premier League, northern ision.Seven of Phil Neville’s current Lionesses side, including Lucy Bronze, Steph Houghton, Jordan Nobbs and Jill Scott, began their careers with Sunderland but things began going wrong when their men’s parent club effectively cut them adrift. According to their most recent accounts Sunderland Ladies lost £424,000 during the financial year ending July 2017, that deficit largely explaining why they failed to apply for a Super League place in the initial round of bidding.By March the composition of the top two isions was largely established but up to nine vacancies remained potentially available. Fifteen teams, including West Ham and Sunderland – now operating in conjunction with Northumbria University – pitched to fill them.The FA has decided that, because of the weakness of certain bids, it will expand the Super League from 10 teams to 11 rather than the 12 or 14 envisaged. Sunderland’s exit means there is no team north of Manchester in the top tier. West Ham’s arrival strengthens London’s influence and has delighted David Sullivan, their parent club’s co-owner.“Gaining Super League status is an incredible achievement for everyone involved in our ladies’ team,” Sullivan said. “I would like to say very well done and congratulations for all their hard work.”Decisions are subject to appeal, to be made within 14 days, and Sunderland have said they are “considering” their position. In the meantime the future will be shrouded in uncertainty for Copeland, who has assisted Neville with the England side, and her squad.Apparent anomalies abound. Yeovil were granted a top-flight place in March, having convinced the FA they had raised the £350,000 required to turn professional. In the campaign just concluded, though, they scored only two goals in 18 games, collecting two points.Brighton, who finished second in WSL2, received a top-ision licence in March but Doncaster Belles, who finished a place above them, were denied promotion because of a lack of viable finances.The second tier expands from 10 to 12 sides with Manchester United investing around £5m in their new side. “Starting a professional team from scratch is challenging but rewarding and we will make every effort to provide the women with the support and experience needed for them to be successful and to uphold the traditions of our great club,” said Ed Woodward, United’s executive vice-chairman. Woodward is expected to shortly confirm that United’s women will be managed by Casey Stoney, a former England defender.United’s fellow newcomers are an interesting bunch. Leicester are receiving heavyweight support from their men’s parent club Charlton’s head coach, Riteesh Mishra, is a rare British Asian football manager Lewes are noteworthy for last year becoming the first English club to pay their male and female players the same and Sheffield United make the leap from the fourth tier to become the second team from Sheffield in the Championship.A restructure under which Watford and Oxford United drop into the third tier is very much the brainchild of Baroness Sue Campbell, the FA’s head of women’s football. “There have been some difficult decisions to make but they’ve been made with the sport’s best interests at heart,” she said. “This is a hugely exciting time for the game and I am hopeful we will look back upon this as one of the most significant decisions made in its history.”The new Super League and Championship fixtures commence on 8-9 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2530ba9f45a72c498008f474bfddda2d700ac2fe/0_329_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ffff2b14a3353f8c8851b313107f9b2","title":"beleaguered amazon tribes remain staunch in defence of their land","story":"As criminals eye the natural riches of their heavily forested territories, the Ka’apor people refuse to be cowed – even if it means taking the law into their own hands It was a letter of unity and solidarity. “Our forest, our rivers, our land are sacred to us,” wrote the Ka’apor tribe, from Maranhão in north-eastern Brazil, to the Munduruku, who live hundreds of miles away on the Tapajós river deep in the Amazon rainforest.Both tribes are under threat from organised criminals who illegally grab land, log trees or prospect for gold. Now, tired of waiting for official protection that often fails to arrive, they are taking law enforcement into their own hands.In three years, the Ka’apor have seized and torched 105 trucks carrying stolen timber, and closed down 14 illegal roads running through their lands, the tribe says. The Munduruku have delineated their own land in an effort to face down the lawless miners and land grabbers.Their foes often have ties to politicians and police, which – combined with the absence of federal oversight – has compelled the tribes to strengthen and organise themselves in the face of an unequal struggle, one in which the state often seems an enemy or ally of the aggressors.The Ka’apor live in the Alto Turiaçu indigenous territory. Since 1982, it has been granted a demarcated constitutional status that protects it for the tribe. But still the heavily forested area in the north of Maranhão has been invaded by illegal loggers, pillaging hardwood.“A lot of this wood goes to Europe, to China, to other places,” says Gilderlan Silva, a representative of the Indian Missionary Council in Maranhão. “You have an economic power that goes right from the gas station owner, who finances the fuel of the logging truck, to the guy who owns the sawmill, right up to the financing of politicians.“It is a market that drives a lot of money.”In 2013, the Ka’apor created a management council based on the tribe’s historic principles. It was a break from their previous system of tribal chiefs, a tradition they say was imposed by Brazil’s National Indian Foundation (Funai).The Ka’apor drafted an agreement to protect themselves, banning alcoholic drinks and drugs, which had arrived in the 17 villages in the hands of loggers.Having recovered the illegal roads and deforested areas from invaders, the Ka’apor established seven villages as protected areas, to repel the intruders.“We protected these areas because we did not want to see the end of our forest,” says Sarapó Ka’apor, one of the founders of the Ywyãhurenda village, a protected area that was previously an entry and exit point for logging trucks. “We got together with the council. We all gathered and took out the loggers. No one waited for Funai, we did it all ourselves.”Such boldness has been the target of retaliation. Three members of the tribe have been murdered since 2010, in killings the tribe suspects were committed by their enemies. The crimes have not been solved. The tribe have also faced several invasions of their land, most recently in January, when 30 armed men threatened to burn down the houses in one village.But last July, Michel Temer, the Brazilian president, obtained congressional approval to amend the constitution, legalising more than 2,000 irregular private properties on public lands in a move that was seen as sympathetic to the interests of land grabbers such as those in Maranhão.The Munduruku, likewise, studied strategies to strengthen the protection of their territory and keep the forest intact. For this, they meet other tribes, such as the Ka’apor, 10 times a year. In 2015, they demarcated their own territory in an attempt to keep out illegal miners and loggers. The tribe even has a problem with poachers stealing palmito, the vegetable of the palm tree.This report was produced by Agência Pública, a non-profit investigative journalism agency based in Brazil.

Both are filled with the spoils of spring. Tempted?A perfect tart to weave together the days of spring and summer. Spears of asparagus, buttery leeks, dijon and an unexpected hit of rosemary. This quick olive-oil pastry is easy enough for a weeknight. I use cherry tomatoes until the season is in full swing.

Lay the tomatoes cut side up on a baking tray, season, drizzle with olive oil, then slowly roast for about an hour, until soft, sweet and gummy. Take a handful out for the dressing, and set aside. Once the tomatoes are roasted, take them out of the oven and turn the heat up temperature to 180C350Fgas 4.Next make the pastry. Put the flour, rosemary, lemon zest and salt into a food processor. Pulse a few times, then add the olive oil and pulse again until you have crumbs. Add about 75ml of cold water until it comes together in a ball. (If you don’t have a food processor you can do this just as easily by hand.)On a floured work surface, roll it out to just bigger than the tart tin, then carefully wrap it around your rolling pin and lower it into the tin. Gently press it in, so the pastry takes the shape of the tin. Prick with a fork and blind bake for 12 minutes (no need to use baking beans for with this pastry).Saute the leek in a little oil for 20 minutes until soft and sweet, add the rosemary and cook for a minute. Put a large pan of salted water on to boil. Snap the asparagus spears spears near the base – they will naturally break off where the fibrous part ends. Boil the asparagus for two to three minutes, until the spears are still firm but not crunchy. Drain, season at once and drizzle with oil.Mix the eggs with the creme fraiche, sauteed leeks, zest and dijon, then season. Once the pastry is ready, scatter with the asparagus, then pour over the creme fraiche mixture and scatter with the tomatoes.Bake the tart on the bottom of the oven at 200C390Fgas 6 for 15-20 minutes, until the pastry is crisp and the eggs just set.

Drizzle with oil, then keep layering the filo and drizzling with oil until you have a good, sturdy, three- to four-sheet layer all over – you may need to patch it together bit by bit if you have small sheets.Drizzle the whole lot with a bit more olive oil, then use a pastry brush to persuade the oil all over the pastry. Spoon the filling into the middle, spread it evenly across the base, put the pan over a medium heat and cook for three to four minutes to crisp up the pastry from the bottom.Fold the excess filo back over the filling to form a wavy edge.

He and his wife hardly slept, ate bad food and listened to strangers weeping. And they were happyWe spent high summer in a\u0026nbspwindowless room on the postnatal ward. It wasn’t even really a\u0026nbsproom\u0026nbsp– just papery blue curtains iding us from five other families. Through the thin fabric, we could hear fate dealing out the cards. On one side, a\u0026nbspmother saying she needed no pain relief and her baby was latching beautifully. On the other, a\u0026nbspmother saying she could hardly bear to look at the thing, let alone feed it. Whenever I\u0026nbspwalked down the corridors, I\u0026nbspsaw other parents sobbing. The happy sobbers were indistinguishable from the sad ones. For our part, our son had an infection from the three-day labour. We had told the doctors we didn’t want him on antibiotics and they said he could be dead within hours and then we said we wanted all the\u0026nbspantibiotics.Twice a\u0026nbspday for seven days, I\u0026nbspshuttled our tiny yellowish creature from the ward to the special care baby unit. I\u0026nbsptook him there in a\u0026nbspplastic box on wheels that looked like a\u0026nbspportable fish tank. He had a\u0026nbspbulky cannula inserted into his wrist. We had to put one of my socks over his arm to stop him tearing out the needle. It was an orange sock and every time I\u0026nbsptook him to get his antibiotics he would whack his outsize orange arm against the sides of the fish tank in protest, like a\u0026nbsplobster who knows he is destined for the pot. Then the doctors would push liquids into his blood and he would scream and then take a\u0026nbsphuge breath so that he could scream\u0026nbspagain.Walking back to the ward each day, I\u0026nbspalways glimpsed the TV in the waiting room, showing Wimbledon. There was Roger Federer, tossing a\u0026nbspball high into sunlight. There was Sue Barker silhouetted against a\u0026nbspcrisp blue sky. Henman hill writhed with all the sunburnt, child-free fans whose only worries were the poor distribution of strawberries in their Pimm’s. Meanwhile, in our lightless cave, we hardly slept, ate bad food and listened to strangers weeping. This was our life now. Summer was for other people. But the strangest thing about all this is that we were\u0026nbsphappy.I had heard stories about the powerful feelings that come with parenthood, but had always feared they would not apply to me. That I\u0026nbspwould be hollow-hearted, coldly observing my child, making notes for my novel.

Who needs sunlight when you can bask in the jaundiced glow of your only child? Our feelings of love for him spilled over into everything.

At least, this is the lie I tell myself, how I am able to face my reflection in the mirror every day without collapsing into a puddle of regret.After spending a year at a dance conservatory in London, I quit. A year later, I tried again at a university in my home state of Virginia. But two years in, I broke my foot and decided to switch to a major that was less tied to my physical integrity: journalism. Soon, I became the arts editor of the school paper. Now, 10 years after graduating from college, I have three beautiful sons and a successful freelance writing career. But the fact that I quit before I had the chance to see if I could truly succeed haunts me to this day.I struggle to articulate this level of experience when explaining my background to people. I “trained to be a professional dancer” I was a “semi-professional dancer” I “studied dance in college and used to teach ballet classes”. When you bring up past dance experience, most people assume it was merely a little girl’s daydream, but for me, it was so much more. What do you call it when you dedicate all of your time and energy to preparing for something but don’t ever become that something? What’s the name for not being strong enough to risk failure so you quit while you’re ahead and live the rest of your life comforting yourself with the notion that you might have “made it” if only you’d really tried? Isn’t that it’s own special, uniquely devastating form of failure?Our culture fetishizes determination, grit, success. We are told again and again that hard work will eventually pay off, that quitting is practically unforgivable. What we don’t hear is that success isn’t necessarily synonymous with happiness and that giving up can be an act of self-preservation.It is spring in New York City and I am 16. My dance teacher has driven me and one other student up so we could take a few master classes at various schools and studios around town and so that I could audition for a place at the Joffrey Ballet School. It is my first visit to New York and I am immediately intoxicated by the dangerous combination of the city’s energy and a newfound sense of freedom. I taste my first Indian food, buy chunky pleather platform loafers, do ballet poses for photos next to the rocks in Central Park.This Joffrey studio is much smaller and much dimmer than I imagined it’s not much more than a couple of grocery-store aisles wide. As a young dancer in a tiny college town, I had envisioned a vast, sun-filled affair, but I underestimated how strapped for space cities are. The worst part of any audition is always before it starts. That’s when you can psych yourself out. I pull at my itchy pink tights and readjust the leg holes of my black leotard. While warming up, I try to avoid my reflection in the mirror, but also keep an eye out for the coveted “skinny mirror” that each studio possesses. It helps that none of the other girls here are auditioning they are students and I am just a guest in the class.Can a thicker brush not make just as beautiful strokes?I am nervous but unintimidated. I know how to do this. I’ve got this. I’m in my element. The class goes well. Really well. I remember all of the combinations, remember to smile. I am energetic and quick on my feet. Most importantly, I can keep up with the other students. After class, I excitedly head to the changing room, surprised by how well I did and hopeful of my chances at being accepted into the school. I think about how, if admitted, I would leave home and live in a dorm at the Carmelite nuns’ convent.“She’s good, but she’s big,” I overhear the instructor say to my dance teacher as I am coming back down the hallway.I stop in my tracks, trying to process this comment without crying or letting on that I heard. But in that moment, my spirit is crushed. So many thoughts swirl through my head on the rest of our trip. I can’t believe that the wrongness of my body’s shape carries more weight than my ability to move it precisely and artfully through space. I can’t believe that a skinnier, potentially less-talented dancer would get “my” spot at the school. But most of all, I can’t believe how embarrassing and utterly humiliating it feels to be turned down not because I’m not good enough, but because I’m not skinny enough.These thoughts eventually crystallize into confusion, questions. Why had I been blessed with these talents in this body? What does it mean when your body is your art? Can a thicker brush not make just as beautiful strokes?I come late to dance. Later than most anyway. I am 11 years old when I take my first class – it’s a free class being offered on the stage of the little community theater in my small college town – but my natural aptitude quickly became apparent. As a naturally quiet, introverted person, dance is a revelation. I don’t have to speak a word to anyone. I discover a world beyond words, where movements tell stories in ways that words only ever dream of doing. It’s a world where words themselves become superfluous and seem almost perversely simplistic, and I am overjoyed to inhabit it every day.Soon, I am training for two to four hours a day. Homeschooling means I can be driven to studios an hour from my home to take classes multiple times a week with more advanced teachers. Finally, I am living with other families or my dance teacher during the week so I can train at the best school in the region. Summers are spent at ballet “intensives”, which means six weeks away from home, living in dorms, taking classes all day at the Washington Ballet and the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. I am getting better and better. I revel in my ability to balance en pointe forever and turn with ease. I once did five rotations in a single pirouette turn. Five. The typical maximum for women is three. It’s a moment I will never forget.But when you hear the word “ballerina”, my body is not what your mind’s eye conjures.When puberty hits at 15, weight begins to stick to me. I begin to sport fleshy hips, meaty thighs, a blossoming bosom. I’m not fat amongst “regular” people – I wear a women’s size 8 – but I am fat for a ballerina. In this profession, rarely is anyone bigger than a size 4. Ballerinas are supposed to be beyond human: to evoke ethereal, otherworldly beings that toe the line between the sensual and the virginal. To have noticeable breasts and hips is to interrupt this fantasy with grotesque sexuality, to remind the audience that you are indeed human.After that audition, I begin to doubt my abilities, question my chances of one day becoming a professional dancer. From then on, I never see exactly what I want in the mirror. Mirrors are unavoidable for most dancers, covering the walls of nearly every studio. I spend hours in front of them every day. I like the lines I see reflected, the shapes I can contort into, how I can mimic the movements of my teachers with relative ease. What the mirror also shows me now are my birthing hips and heavy boobs, the wiggly bits of flesh hanging from my upper arms. Now when I see all my fellow dancers reflected in the mirror around me, I see not how harmonious our movements are, but how their slight frames magnify the generousness of my own.“Are you sure you’re a ballet dancer,” the orthopedic surgeon asked at a consultation for persistent pain in the joint of my right big toe. “Because you look more like a modern dancer.” I am 17 years old. And after visiting a dozen doctors in my small hometown – enduring painful cortisone shots that provided no relief – we drove two hours to see this doctor because he is the company doctor for a big regional ballet troupe. His comment leaves me embarrassed, scrambling for an answer. I’m pretty sure the doctor believes my pain is the result of the “excess” weight I am putting on my feet, but sure enough, his scans uncover a tendon fraying and rubbing in between the bones of my joint.I did try modern dance later, when I was in college. While it is a more freeing form of dance – less rigid, significantly more forgiving of differing body types – I honestly wasn’t very good at it. At school in London, I was placed in the highest level of ballet and the lowest level of modern.The summer after that crushing Joffrey audition, I am sent to stay at my grandparents’ horse farm an hour outside of New Orleans without the rest of my immediate family. It’s partly meant to be a punishment for being caught kissing a boy while just shy of the pre-appointed old-enough age of 16. But no parental punishment was worse than what I could inflict upon myself. Not for kissing boys, mind you – that was fun – but for being fat.To drown out the hum of the treadmill, I turn up the local alternative rock radio station on my cassette Walkman. The song is White Town’s I Could Never Be Your Woman. It features heavily in the rotation this summer. I haven’t lived enough to appreciate what the lyrics are implying, but the song’s eerie, repeated refrain haunts me. I keep running. The air conditioning struggles to counteract the stifling humidity. Some people say the air is “close” but it feels more like nature is trying to slowly suffocate you by gradually replacing the air with water. Best grow gills or flounder and die. I run for an hour every day, pushing the incline button higher and higher, pushing the speed button again and again. Through the sweat and the muscle aches. I stop only when I get so dizzy I worry I might pass out and fall. I run away from my fat, away from the possibility of failure. I run and I run but I never get where I want to go. I quickly discover that trying to induce my own vomiting is much too traumatic and difficult. My grandmother presents lovingly prepared, home-cooked southern food – fried eggs and meat-and-potato hash, beautiful pies – but I eat only one meal a day and refuse the rest. I love hash it’s something we never eat at home. It’s a salty, fluffy, greasy southern indulgence like no other. I’ve never refused her cooking before, but if my grandmother senses something is amiss, she doesn’t mention it. Outside of my mother’s watchful eye, I try my hand at bulimia. I quickly discover that trying to induce my own vomiting is much too traumatic and difficult. So instead, I down excessive amounts of milk of magnesia laxative. Nothing I try leads to much in the way of weight loss, mostly because I am simply messing with my metabolism. When I start eating a healthy amount of food and stop abusing laxatives, I put the weight right back on.The sweetest revenge, the best way to prove all of the doubters and haters wrong, would’ve been to go on to be wildly successful. Our culture is very clear that overcoming your shortcomings to emerge victorious is the only acceptable ending to such stories. But years of hearing how incorrect my body was took its toll. It’s hard to love an art form that everyone is telling you doesn’t love you back. It becomes too difficult to reconcile your physical talent with your physical inadequacy. I’ve largely stopped bringing up my dance background to new acquaintances. Not because it’s so far in the past or even because I don’t know how to define my experience, but because I know that when I say I was a ballet dancer, I am certain that person immediately assesses my body and wonders what kind of fantasyland I once lived in. “Ballet” has become my trigger word. Talking about it releases the hounds of self-loathing and crushing regret, who nip determinedly at my ankles.I left the world of dance for the world of words because the writing world doesn’t care if I break my foot. I figured if I couldn’t dance, at least I could write about it. I reasoned that since my body isn’t central to the art of journalism, the writing world shouldn’t care if I am 150 pounds or 250 pounds. I know now that there are no industries, virtually no spaces where women’s bodies aren’t judged. Yet writing, while still a creative pursuit, does not feed my soul in the same way that dance – the world beyond words – does.I haven’t seen the inside of a dance studio in about eight years. Every day that I don’t dance, a sliver of my soul withers. My heart aches to move again, to get lost in myself, to get lost in music, in motion, in space to trace those familiar patterns and shapes that still come so easily to me as I twirl safe in my kitchen. I want so much more. I want to be in a real studio with my peers on a real stage. I want to know what it would have been like if I’d kept going, kept pushing back at the haters.I can’t help but feel jealous of the adults I see talking about taking up ballet or re-entering the studio again for the first time since they were young. I envy that pure, uncomplicated joy that dance can bring it’s something I fear I’ll never feel again. I can’t just waltz into a dance studio and take a class. If merely mentioning dance to someone spurs a rush of inadequacy and failure, who knows what actually taking a class might unearth within me. Besides, I am not like them. I am not one of those people who merely took a few ballet classes in middle school. I could have been a professional. I got too close, so it hurts too much. It’s been a long road, but my body and I have come to a detente. I’m now a happy size 12: satisfied by the knowledge that my body – whether in spite of or because of its size – has executed perfect pirouettes and birthed beautiful babies. But coming to terms with my body doesn’t mean I necessarily forgive it for betraying me that I’ll ever stop wondering whether I might have spent my life onstage had I only been a bit lighter.Olivia Campbell is a journalist and essayist specializing in medicine, mothering, arts, and history.

Growing up in Portsmouth, I felt it was the far superior seaside town. Even though it’s just an hour away on the fast train, for me, in 2003, it felt like a different world. In Portsmouth, I felt trapped. I knew lots of people and I’m from a big family, so I always felt like I was being watched: I wasn’t. I would get on the train at Fratton, she would jump on at Chichester and 60 minutes later I would be looking out on Brighton beach.Brighton was the perfect place for a little gay to have a go at being “out” for an hour or so before going back home and pretending to have a crush on Leonardo DiCaprio (when, in truth, I just wanted to kiss Kate Winslet).She was fit, cool and had a really good MP3 player. I guess it was my first flutter of feelings for someone. I don’t think we were a couple, we never had that chat, we just both knew we were a bit different from everyone else, and in Brighton that summer we felt normal. I remember seeing older girls on the seafront pretty, cool and happily queer. I would stare at them, besotted, and wonder what their lives were like, if their families knew or if they had been kicked out of home. Were they ashamed like me? They seemed happy and they were having a laugh. It gave me hope that coming out wouldn’t ruin my life. That summer, I felt alive, I felt free. We shared roll-up cigarettes and the occasional kiss under the pier, talking about who we were going to become, where we were going to live and the adventures we would share.The six-week summer break came to an end and so did our brief romance. She decided to come out when we went back to college: she was telling everyone, even her mum. I thought she had completely lost her mind (it took at least another five years to get me out of the closet). We had a huge row on Brighton pier just in front of the waltzers a few people stopped to watch, which felt both exciting and embarrassing. She called me a dyke, I called her a bitch and we barely spoke again.It wasn’t exactly the perfect ending to my summer of love. After the row, she stormed off and I jumped on my skateboard and flew down the seafront with tears in my eyes and sea salt in my hair. I felt like I was in music video, which was thrilling, until I clipped a stone, came tumbling off and ripped my favourite pair of Dickies jeans. I vowed I would never love again, in that way that only a 17-year-old can."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0231e7474aa77487f3994190b54e6b3d306be09/0_0_4144_3032/master/4144.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=716487c3b97cba9584ea0db54d4e95b8 1320w","title":"all points east review victoria park london bjork lcd soundsystem lorde","story":"Victoria Park, LondonBig-hitting headliners such as LCD Soundsystem and Lorde made the first All Points East a success, but thin afternoon bills and a fuzzy identity didn’t helpLate last year, All Points East sent shockwaves through the London festival circuit. Hosted by Coachella promoters Goldenvoice and its parent company AEG (founded by controversial Republican donor Philip Anschutz), the bumper 10-day event was set to oust long-term residents Field Day, Lovebox and Citadel from east London’s Victoria Park. Really, this wasn’t a straightforward case of imperious corporate giant v the little guys – Lovebox for one is owned by promoter behemoth Live Nation – but that hasn’t prevented APE from acquiring the air of a bland business venture.It’s difficult to detect any specific identity among the branded displays and colossal Pizza Express concessions, and while its displaced forebears all have distinct party lines – Field Day continues to act as a hipster haven, Lovebox has doubled down on rap and R\u0026ampB and Citadel focuses on indie and extra-musical entertainment – the All Points East lineup seems strung together by neither style nor sensibility.That said, the festival’s big bookings are strong enough to warrant a little fuzziness elsewhere. Friday’s main stage sported a double dose of New York City nostalgia from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and LCD Soundsystem – eminently danceable and insistently poignant, they are the platonic ideal of festival headliners. While you could argue that Saturday’s bill-toppers the xx also boast those qualities, the London trio weren’t quite as compelling: their tendency to revert to a glacial pace meant their set sagged slightly in the middle. More triumphant was Father John Misty’s polyphonic folk, and Lorde, whose unorthodox pop amassed euphoric heft along the way.The afternoon bills felt thin, though there were gems to be found. Hookworms provided a warm blast of emo-punk Stefflon Don gave a masterclass in sonorous dancehall Hercules and Love Affair showcased sumptuous disco. In fact, there was a strong dance music showing, with a DJ-dedicated stage and a weekend-long outing for James Murphy and Soulwax’s brilliant makeshift club Despacio.It was left to Sunday headliner Björk to create a lasting impression for this rather disparate series of shows. Doubling as the first UK date on her European tour, her stunning avant-pop opera had a suitably awesome backdrop in the form of a (real) full moon and lightning display – plus a lush woodland stage set. Largely a showcase of songs from last year’s “Tinder album” Utopia, the title track’s pastoral woodwind was quickly flooded by treacly bass, and the twisted bucolicism continued from there: glitchy storms of production juxtaposed against impish flautists and Björk’s unmistakable voice. The latter, both urgent and brittle, ensured that even old hits such as Human Behaviour bristled with life. In many ways, Björk’s performance felt detached from the surroundings – her career has been defined by idiosyncrasy and integrity, which aren’t exactly All Points East buzzwords – but it provided an undoubtedly sublime climax to the weekend nevertheless.Not that this spelled the end of All Points East’s debut outing: the next few days will see the festival grounds stage free community-minded events, while the final stretch will be filled, confusingly, by a trio of one-off gigs that very much resembles another three-day festival. It remains to be seen whether its backers believe it’s worth carving out any sort of coherent character for All Points East. Currently little more than a showcase for high-calibre (and presumably pricey) headline acts, its debut proved a decent if not especially distinctive addition to the festival calendar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bdec5e3c59ecbebe158222092622a6c6460448a/0_0_4032_3024/master/4032.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d0c28b025bca87a4bf726b6482e29a77 1440w","title":"chris froome giro victory questions adverse analytical finding","story":"Refreshingly, many of the new generation emerging in cycling are unencumbered by clear memories of the sport’s recent past. It is partly in that context that the reaction of the New Zealander George Bennett to Chris Froome’s Giro d’Italia winning performance on Friday en route to Bardonecchia has to be seen.Confronted with the news that Froome had held out over 80 kilometres over three mountains to take the overall lead, Bennett – captured on video by his Lotto-NL team’s social media people and by the website cyclingnews – could not hide his disbelief. “Did Froome stay away? No way. He did a Landis. Jesus!” His reference was to Floyd Landis’s astonishing comeback to win at Morzine in the 2006 Tour de France, which set up the American as, provisionally, the overall winner, until a positive test for testosterone was announced.This kind of parallel is the stuff of any spin doctor’s nightmares and Lotto-NL promptly issued a statement explaining that Bennett did not mean to cast aspersions. “This is not an insinuation but a way to express the admiration for an exceptional achievement,” the team said. Bennett, inevitably, was asked to explain himself, which – less inevitably but admirably – he was willing to do. “If we can’t compare a cyclist to another cyclist, we can’t make a comparison to any cyclist in the last 20 years,” he argued just before the stage start on Saturday.That point regarding the complexity of ranking performance in a sport that is dogged by half a century of doping is well made but cycling’s current ability to tie itself in knots is second to none. On one level Froome’s ride to Bardonecchia was the climax of a breathtaking Giro, which saw dramatic collapses – Esteban Chaves, Simon Yates and Thibaut Pinot, who abandoned on Sunday morning – and a dramatic reversal of fortune, from a position where it looked as if Froome stood no chance of his third consecutive Grand Tour victory.On another level this was pretty much what had been feared by those who felt that Froome should not ride the Giro d’Italia as he awaits the verdict on an adverse analytical finding for salbutamol, which he is contesting on the grounds that he has done nothing wrong. The issue is nothing to do with Froome personally. He showed courage, moral and physical, in making that escape on Friday, he demonstrated breathtaking descending skill and he showed admirable sangfroid in limiting his losses day by day for the first two weeks of the Giro. If ever there was a race that demonstrated the adage that you may not win a stage race on any given day but you must try not to lose it, this was the one.A Froome win leaves the race result in abeyance pending the ruling. He may keep the win or he may not.If the results were to be rejigged, however, that act alone cannot rewrite the history of the race. That history was forged by Team Sky and Froome, whose decision to race hard on Wednesday and Friday blew the standings to bits.It remains to be seen whether the 2018 Giro d’Italia could be yet another race in cycling history with an asterisk against it, yet another which counts for nothing.It is to avoid putting an entire race in limbo due to delay in resolving an Adverse Analytical Finding that the Mouvement Pour un Cyclisme Crédible, the sport’s voluntary anti-doping body, insists that its member teams do not field riders facing an AAF in races. As the 2017 winner and Froome’s runner-up this year, Tom Dumoulin, pointed out, if it had been him that was contesting a salbutamol ruling, he would not have been permitted to start the Giro.Team Sky have always refused to join the MPCC. (In the interests of fairness it should be pointed out that Simon Yates’s Mitchelton-Scott and the Astana team of the third finisher, Miguel-Ángel López, are among the World Tour teams who are not members either.) It is their legitimate right but it leaves them open to the criticism that they are putting their own interests above those of their sport. But in the last 18 months the team appear to have given little sign they are interested in the wider image of cycling, with their response to the tale of Jiffy Bags, lost medical records, the 55 doses of cortisone they bought between 2010 and 2013, and its climax in a highly critical – albeit strongly denied – parliamentary committee report.It is now five weeks until the Tour de France peloton gathers in the Vendée. There is every indication that Froome’s salbutamol ruling will not be complete by then. More contortions are in store, quite possibly lasting until late summer or early autumn. Unfortunately the Giro may be only the beginning of the end game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cebc47d070cf4a76a78a01f5b41eef442e5f41f9/0_61_1646_988/master/1646.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc5cd167ed655df0c41e96c01a51c228","title":"england drop mark stoneman keaton jennings pakistan headingley test","story":"England have responded to the dismal nine-wicket defeat by Pakistan at Lord’s by dropping Mark Stoneman and recalling Keaton Jennings as the second opener.Stoneman replaced Jennings in the team last summer after his former Durham team-mate struggled to follow up a century on debut against India in Mumbai the previous winter and endured four disappointing Tests against South Africa.Stoneman showed courage under fire during the Ashes defeat but a string of low scores for Surrey at the start of the summer had left him vulnerable. England kept the faith with the intention of giving him both Tests against Pakistan. His showing at Lord’s forced the change, with the 30-year-old looking bereft of form and confidence while making scores of four and nine.Jennings, who joined Lancashire during the winter, has started the season brightly and will open alongside Alastair Cook on Friday as England attempt to square the series at Headingley."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa88bff9bf7b3959431affa9c630163efa68f066/9_1_4914_2948/master/4914.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3f58b39a57c287d563342d0a9445fb5","title":"unanswered questions leave chris froome in the shadow of suspicion","story":"While Simon Yates comes out of the Giro d’Italia with credit, there is still uncertainty about Team Sky and their lead rider When Simon Yates cracked so disastrously on the bottom slopes of the Colle delle Finestre while leading the Giro d’Italia last Friday, it looked like the most humiliating of personal catastrophes. Yet it may have been the best thing that has ever happened to the young English rider, at least if he wants to avoid the fate of Chris Froome, the man who caused his downfall. Yates had gone into his 13th day in the leader’s pink jersey holding an advantage of almost half a minute over his nearest pursuer, with the memory of a trio of majestic victories on mountain stages to keep his morale high as he faced the challenge of hanging on for just three more days. He couldn’t do it. As Team Sky marshalled their forces to send a revived Froome spinning up the unmade road leading to the 2,178m summit, Yates had no answer. When Froome slipped away from the leading bunch up the right-hand side of the road, with 80km of the stage and two more major climbs still to go, the young Englishman was looking to his left. When he spotted the danger he found there was nothing left in the legs that had carried him clear of his rivals on those earlier mountains. By the end of stage 19 he had lost the huge amount of 38 minutes and all hope of finishing high in the general classification, never mind of challenging Froome for the victory.  A day later, on the stage from Susa to Cervina, he lost a further 45 minutes and on Sunday in Rome he wound up 21st in the final overall classification, an hour and a quarter behind Froome. But in one respect – perhaps, in the end, the most important of all – his downfall represented an unexpected success. By hitting the wall two days in a row, Yates provided convincing evidence that he is riding clean. Any doper cracking as comprehensively he did would make sure the same thing did not happen the next day. That’s what Floyd Landis did in the 2006 Tour de France, when he responded to failure on the Galibier and the Croix de Fer by dosing himself with testosterone and returning to take a stage to the ski station at Morzine with an epic solo escape of 120kms. That positioned him to take the yellow jersey in Paris, which he did – until the traces of testosterone showed up and he was stripped of his victory.  Yates’s failure surely banished the doubts cast by the four-month ban handed down in 2016 after his team had failed to complete a TUE form for a controlled asthma medication. Even though the official designation of the offence was “non-intentional doping”, Yates was the first to admit that the shadow would linger, possibly for the remainder of his career. Now, perhaps, it has been removed. Froome would love to be able to say the same, but he chose to race in Italy while last year’s adverse analytical finding for Salbutamol is still under investigation. That is his right, and he claims that the findings will clear him to everyone’s satisfaction. But he cannot blame those who have listened to so many lies from cyclists that they are inclined to make scepticism their first response. For them, the instinctive desire to cheer was stifled long before he had crossed the finish line. His great escape on the Finestre should have been worthy of a place in road cycling’s most romantic feats. The names of Coppi, Merckx and other heroes of various golden ages were widely invoked, but I was reminded, as Froome made his way through the banks of snow at the summit, of the Luxembourg champion Charly Gaul’s astonishing ride through the Dolomites from Merano to Monte Bondone on stage 20 of the 1956 Giro. The Angel of the Mountains, as he was nicknamed, started the day in 24th place overall and launched his attack in unspeakably filthy weather, gradually shedding all his rivals. Many of them abandoned the race altogether on the final climb, during which Gaul’s frozen limbs had to be revived during a brief stop with warm water and a swift massage from his team manager before he remounted to finish the 240km stage more than eight minutes ahead of his nearest pursuer. Two days later, just like Froome, he was in the pink jersey on the final podium.Such are the legends on which cycling history is built (and, yes, we accept that the heroes of the golden ages used primitive doping products to dull the pain). Froome, elbows out and legs whirring as he raced up the shale track before plunging down a descent made treacherous by rivulets of meltwater, was bidding to join them, and to some he did. For once, even his inelegant style, normally an affront to those who prize elegance on a bike, made perfect sense: he grew up riding mountain bikes on trails in Kenya, and here he was putting those techniques to good use. Others, however, look at Team Sky’s tainted record over the past couple of years, involving inconsistent accounts of potentially damaging incidents and medical records that went missing or were never kept. They wonder why, when Froome was asked point-blank during the Giro’s first rest day whether he was still using Salbutamol, he refused to give an answer. Perhaps he did so in the belief that he retains the right to the statutory confidentiality which was ripped apart when the adverse finding was made public by this newspaper. But cycling, and serial grand tour winners in particular, long ago forfeited the right to keep secrets. While it continues to do so, some of us who long to applaud will be keeping our hands in our pockets.

Again, just like the first set. Wawrinka bent double as he tries to prevent a further break. Certain tennis players have a reputation for putting on injuries when they are losing, but this looks genuine. The movement has gone, but the determination hasn’t. He manages, via deuce, to win the game. That’s 4-3 now. Bad news for Stan! Garcia-Lopez has broken Wawrinka. He served out the next game to love and his winning shot saw the Swiss really look as if he can barely walk. It’s 4-2 in the fifth set, and seemingly no way back. Wawrinka may not not wish some kind of death or glory comeback if it damages his knee any further. Dutra da Silva, just as in the first set, has taken a 2-0 lead in the second set. Meanwhile, Garcia-Lopez and Stan Wawrinka cannot be separated they are at 2-2 in the fifth and final set. Djokovic has his face on, despite winning that first set 6-3 after those early scares from Rogério Dutra da Silva. The Barcelona commuter, the lucky loser, Marco Trungelliti, has beaten Bernard Tomic, 6-4 5-7 6-4 6-4. His mum and gran will be pleased, not least because he has won 79,000 extra euros as a result. All those “are we there yet?” calls have been so worth it. Ridiculous rally follows that. Wawrinka eventually forces Garcia-Lopez into a mistake but there is still a set point. That’s won by an ace. And that takes this match into a fifth set. How long can Stan’s knee hold? Wawrinka loses his bearings when presented with a chance to volley the ball home and it sails beyond the baseline. Set point to Garcia-Lopez. At last, someone blinks, and Wawrinka is the victim of some fine forehand play from Garcia-Lopez. He goes 5-3 up, but then makes an error to take it back to 5-4. “Vamos, vamos,” says Garcia-Lopez once more. And he holds his two serves, though Wawrinka made an unenforced error when a golden volleying chance was his. At the change of ends, both have won all of their service points. Into the tie-break we go, Wawrinka wins both his to go 2-1 up. Djokovic has broken back and the score with Dutra Silva is at 2-2.Wobbles from Wawrinka, whose urgency to get this done is causing him to over-amp things, but he does manage to force a tie-break by making it 6-6. Some stretches, and it’s Garcia-Lopez to serve first. At 5-5 in the fourth set, Wawrinka forces a pair of errors from Garcia-Lopez, and gets to break point again. His first attempt is a backhand rocket which he can’t keep down, and it bounces out of bounds. At deuce, Garcia-Lopez serves well to gain the advantage, and then holds the set with an overhead. Another rescue job from Wawrinka is required. Meanwhile, Dutra Silva held his serve and is 2-0 up on Djokovic. Wawrinka looks troubled, well below his best, but he squares it at 5-5. Garcia-Lopez was presented with an open goal of a winner, but got caught in several minds, and his drop shot rattled off the net. Garcia-Lopez held his nerve and his serve to make it 5-4 and that means Warwinka must hold his serve in this game, or set five, which his dodgy left knee won’t appreciate, will beckon. Djokovic was broken in the first game of his match with Dutra Silva. Nobody, aside from Cameron Norrie, is having it easy out there. Some animalistic noises from Wawrinka as he seeks to win the match in this set. The heavy weaponry is being used, and he hits two howitzers down the line to force a break point. “Vamos,” says Garcia-Lopez to himself, knowing this is a vital juncture, and it goes to deuce. Warwinka didn’t make too much of a fight with the seventh game of the fourth set and is now 4-3 down to Garcia Lopez. His serving has been a little more assured here, and he seemed set to make it 4-4 with ease only for it to come back to 40-30. Garcia Lopez disputed the call that won Wawrinka the game, but the set is back in the balance now. On the Philippe Chatrier court, Novak Djokovic is warming up ahead of his match with Brazilian veteran Rogério Dutra Silva.And Garcia-Lopez levels to break back. He was a little lucky with a drop shot that hit the net cord, for which he was apologetic, and there are worrying signs of Wawrinka getting a little distracted. Warwinka a break up now and heading for a victory that looked so unlikely when Garcia-Lopez cruised to that 6-2 win. A note of caution: Stan did not sit down on the change of ends his dodgy knee is clearly playing up again. Stan Wawrinka took the third set 6-4 and it’s going with serve in the fourth at 2-2. Garcia Lopez is having to do all the chasing now. Meanwhile, the other big breaking news is that former world number 1 Victoria Azarenka has perished in the first round, losing to Katerina Siniakova of the Czech Republic, who won 7-5 7-5. The former Wimbledon champ had to dig deep in a game that took over two hours. At the end, she found her straps, though a number of flat spots gave reason for caution. And Kvitova gets the break, and will serve for the match. Kvitova, 4-5 down to Cepede Royg, suddenly found her serving mojo and hit three aces. It’s 5-5 and getting nervy. A punishing forehand from Warwinka takes it to 5-3. The niggling knee appears to have been forgotten. Stan Wawrinka is 4-3 up in the third set now, and with a break to his name. It’s a battle royale on Court Philippe Chatrier, where’s it’s 4-4 between Kvitova and Cepede Royg in the third and final set. A modest, but confident Cameron Norrie speaks after his 41-minute match ended with Gojowczyk abandoning with injury. I am not sure what was going on with him but I will take the win.I was really really nervous. He was a little bit tired from last week. It was tough to get the win in that way but I’ll take it. The body was feeling good and the mind is fresh. Norrie will play local French hero Lucas Pouille in the next round. Not a bad morning’s work from him, and he taken some official Roland Garros towels as souvenirs. The German gave up the ghost when 3-0 down and a set down in the second set. He was unable to continue. Good signs from Norrie in that match, though Gojowczyk’s obvious lack of fitness needs to be taken into account. Norrie won the first set 6-1.

Potential cast members were not auditioned, but invited to taster sessions if they concluded that the project was for them and could commit the required rehearsal time on Friday evenings and Saturdays, they were in.The key to managing the biggest team she has ever worked with, says co-director and Lyceum associate Wils Wilson, has been preparation. She brandishes a script in which every cast member’s name and photograph is attached to notes on their interests, skills and allotted parts. Every single entrance has been numbered and linked to accompanying costumes and props.The feat of choreography and coordination is evident in rehearsal, as iniduals criss-cross the stage at different speeds, performing separate mimes, or get drawn into mini-dramas as they go, amazingly never once banging into each other. Some characters are instantly recognisable – Charlie Chaplin twirls his cane and a sprinkling of mythological creatures add a surreal tone to proceedings – while others are more quotidian, leaving it open to the audience to write their own stories around each appearance.As a movement specialist, Parker is used to working without words, but Handke’s script offers roles and actions for each character. “Actors always want to know, ‘But why am I doing that?’ and here I can say, ‘Stick to the task’. Not having words to learn frees the body so much: they are doing, often things that they do every day.”The sense of collective endeavour is powerful among cast members too: David Hunter, a 58-year-old NHS practice manager, is a regular visitor to the Lyceum and suffered a serious brain injury last year that affected his mobility and speech. “From a personal point of view, it’s been a tremendous experience,” he says. “Everyone has been so supportive, especially helping me work on the movement and coordination.”The production marks the end of David Greig’s second season as Lyceum artistic director, but was the first pitch that he made to the Lyceum board, he explains. The use of a community cast bookends with his autumn 2016 debut, his own updating of Aeschylus’s 2,500-year-old tragedy about a refugee crisis, The Suppliant Women, which similarly used local volunteers to carry the work.The Hour took longer to come together, says Greig: “The logistics are hard because of the sheer scale.”“Also Handke was exploring the public space as a place of dream and imagination and surprise,” he adds, “and I want the Lyceum to be an engine of civic energy and transformation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e50f507b2f216c68088cce4dd630080005d560c/0_50_6476_3886/master/6476.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf074e09b3cccf3fd279a3f213b9ab02","title":"dundee locals guide new va museum waterfront","story":"The city’s beautiful waterfront is being reinvigorated thanks to a £1bn makeover, with the stunning new V\u0026ampA museum, the first outside London, as its centrepieceDundee and the River Tay come as a pair. From William McGonagall’s poetry paying tribute to “the silvery Tay”, recounting the rail bridge disaster of 1879, to the current waterfront transformation, the river is the lifeblood of the town. The best way to see the city from the Tay estuary is to board a vessel operated by Pirate Boats, which operates from the pretty former fishing village of Broughty Ferry, five miles up the coast.And it is from the water that you get perhaps the best views of the beautiful new Kengo Kuma-designed V\u0026ampA, which will have permanent Scottish design galleries including objects from Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s Oak Tea Room. The trip also takes in Broughty Castle, the Larick Beacon, lighthouses, the strangely beautiful oil rigs, a grey seal colony, and the real possibility of seeing a pod of bottlenose dolphins.• One hour trip from £80 for two adults and two children (7-15) or £24 per adult, pirateboatsltdThe new V\u0026ampA will have much to live up to in the form of the McManus, the museum and art gallery that celebrated its 150th anniversary last year. This is a popular weekend hangout for nerdy schoolchildren who, like me, are fascinated by the Tay whale skeleton and the gruesome torture implements from medieval Dundee. There was a collective sigh of relief when it turned out they were still in place at the museum’s reopening in 2010 following its refurbishment. The McManus combines social history with an impressive painting collection and temporary exhibitions. From 2 June to 21 October the McManus will become the McMenace, with an exhibition celebrating the Beano, produced by Dundee publishers DC Thomson, as the comic reaches its 80th birthday.• Admission free, Albert Square, mcmanus The DCA was the cornerstone of the city’s cultural renaissance. When it opened in 1999 it was regarded with suspicion by some, but now, with its combination of art installations, creative learning programmes, a two-screen cinema, and a cafe bar with outside seating, it has become a destination that offers as much to fans of blockbusters as to chin-strokers. In combination with Creative Dundee, it has created Behind the Scenes, a walking tour giving backstage access to the city’s cultural venues and workshops, starting at the DCA and taking in Dundee Rep and the McManus.• Galleries free, 152 Nethergate, dca.org.ukOn the waterfront, and part of the £1bn redevelopment, Slessor Gardens is Dundee’s newest public space.

It also hosts outdoor gigs, with Steps in June, Rita Ora in July, Simple Minds in September, and more to be announced. There are quiet areas for city-centre contemplation and the Discovery Walk with bronze plaques paying tribute to local inventors and social reformers.• dundeewaterfrontDraffens was once the city’s department store of choice – it closed in the 1980s – and part of its basement now houses this speakeasy, with cocktails starting at around £8 (try the “corpse reviver”, a mix of gin with triple sec and absinthe). There is no official online presence (an unofficial Facebook page gives the location) but to save your shoe leather, it can be found down an alleyway called Couttie’s Wynd off Nethergate. The entrance is unsigned and unassuming but listen out for the jazz below.Good cake is widely available in Dundee, though visitors will struggle to find a slab of the traditional Scottish fruitcake that bears the city’s name.

Homemade soups, snacks, hot drinks and cakes are reasonably priced compared with the chain cafes, and the atmosphere adds extra value.• 11 Union Street, on FacebookThe brainchild of a University of Dundee student, OpenClose has provided local street artists with the canvas of neglected doorways on city centre backstreets. This has created two open-air art trails, with a location map of the 19 doorways available to download from the project’s website. The success of OpenClose has extended its reach from the city centre into other areas of Dundee, with artists bringing the forgotten doorways of Stobswell to life.• Free, openclosedundeeFor more than 40 years Groucho’s has welcomed and educated music lovers, watching its racks go almost full circle from only vinyl to predominantly vinyl with a hangover from the invasion of those pesky CDs.

Visit some of the best beaches in the world with a trip to Miami, San Diego and Los AngelesStop 1: Miami, FloridaIf your idea of holiday heaven is the sand between your toes and sea breeze in your hair, then this trip to the US is a shore thing. Start by flying into the ultimate beach city of Miami. From the pastel buildings and teeny-weeny bikinis of South Venice to the rugged scenery and bike trails of Key Biscayne, Miami gives famously good – and varied – beach action.Mid Beach, MiamiIf the thongs and flash cars of South Beach get a bit too much, then Mid Beach – just a few miles north – is where Miami’s stylish scenesters hang out. For the full Club Tropicana experience, The Miami Beach Edition hotel has indoor and outdoor pools, a bowling alley, an ice-skating rink and cocktails served in bronze pineapples. Although sadly the song lied – the drinks aren’t free. What does come gratis is scoping out all the nearby art deco architecture which lines Collins Avenue and Ocean Drive.Bill Baggs Cape Florida state park, Key BiscayneKey Biscayne (known as “the key” to locals) feels like you’re escaping the city to an island oasis, even though it’s just a short drive over the bridge (hire a car from Avis for the ride). Bill Baggs is the beach for secluded sunbathing, cycling, kayaking, windsurfing and views of the Miami skyline. Pop into the mid-19th-century Cape Florida Lighthouse (ancient by US standards) and catch a glimpse of Stiltsville, a collection of historic homes that appear to float above the bay. Lighthouse Cafe, right on the shore, is the spot for a cold beer and a fish supper. Surfside, Miami BeachThis sleepy little beach town was where the Hollywood elite hung out in the 1930s, and it now hosts community picnics on the sand and street food trucks on the third Thursday of every month. The restaurants in town represent Miami’s melting pot of cultures, from the duck fat matzo ball soup at Josh’s Deli to the spaghetti at Cafe Ragazzi. The Grand Beach Hotel Surfside has a rooftop pool with sunset views, and suites where the coast is so close you could reach out and build a sandcastle.Stop 2: San Diego, California With its year-round sunshine and more than 70 miles of beaches, the southernmost tip of California is just a five-hour flight from Miami with American Airlines. Swim, surf, sunbathe or just soak up some southern-Californian vibes.La Jolla CoveTucked between sandstone cliffs, this white sand gem gives way to a deep aquamarine bay, where snorkellers and scuba ers can explore sea caves, underwater canyons and more marine life than a Nemo movie – the area is protected by the San Diego La Jolla underwater park ecological reserve. Just north of the cove is La Jolla proper, a mile-long stretch of sand known for its gentle breaks, making it an ideal beach for learning how to surf or stand-up paddleboard (also known as Sup). CoronadoThis dreamy stretch of sand at the tip of the peninsula is regularly featured on the best beaches in the US lists. The Hotel del Coronado (“The Del”) is the ultimate wooden beach house – with fairytale turrets, and was the setting for Some Like It Hot, filmed there in 1958. If some like it cooler, you can always take a break from the glorious sunshine by strolling down to the boutique shops, galleries and museum on Orange Avenue.Pacific BeachWhether at a beachside bonfire or in one of the many bars and clubs, “PB” is where San Diego’s surfer dudes and students hang out. The boardwalk is full of rollerbladers and skateboarders, and there are more restaurants and bars here than you can shake your surf wax at. Kono’s Cafe is a brunch institution, and SandBar claims to have the best fish tacos in San Diego (and recently won second place for the best fish tacos in the whole of California) – which is saying something.Stop 3: Los Angeles, CaliforniaRenting a car from Avis and driving two hours up the coast on the legendary Pacific Coast Highway to Los Angeles rewards roadtrippers with beautiful beach stop-offs along the way. Explore the upscale areas of Laguna and Newport Beach (all your fantasies of The OC brought to life) and don’t miss Crystal Cove, where Beaches was filmed in 1988, to get you in the mood for La La Land.Venice BeachFrom the Arnie-alikes pumping iron at Muscle Beach and the acrobatical break dancers, to the influencers posing for selfies in front of street art – there’s never a dull moment in Venice Beach. And despite tech companies such as Snapchat moving to town, the area’s bohemian, eclectic vibe remains as distinctive and enthralling as the smell of incense on the boardwalk. Stay in nearby Santa Monica at the stylish Shutters on the Beach, which has a copy of Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea in every room.Manhattan BeachLess than five miles south of LAX airport, Manhattan Beach has two miles of beaches with sand so fine that developers exported it to Waikiki Beach in the 1920s. Perfect your spike at the volleyball nets, or stroll down the wooden pier to check out the free aquarium. Grab lunch at the seafood shack Fishing With Dynamite – it’s delicious.MalibuThis area is known for A-list homes and some of the finest beaches in LA. Head to Zuma Beach for a surf lesson from Malibu Makos Surf Club or go outdoor rock climbing on the bluffs with Rock N Rope Adventures. Make a reservation to tour the Eames House, Charles and Ray’s home, or just sit and watch the seals and dolphins from Point Dume.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ccb0223a80e7ec1baf93ac35a222e693ae87f1/0_0_5600_3362/master/5600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95b13522b048658e5e37328576103cce","title":"deep south sounds the ultimate music geeks playlist","story":"Take an aural trip through the southern states of the US – arguably the birthplace of country, rock‘n’roll, jazz and blues – and you’ll be hankering to visit the south for realA musical journey through the deep south is a melodious thing, and I should know – I did a trip there myself with a newly acquired husband, seven years ago, for our amazing honeymoon. How lucky we were. The music of Louisiana, Tennessee and Georgia provides an incredible trip through the rich history of the US, exploring the way Americans express themselves through jazz, soul, country, pop and blues. Even though I’m now an old married soul, these tunes still resound loudly in my life, and I want to jump on a plane every time I hear them.We start with a blast in New Orleans, and the life-affirming noise of the brilliant Rebirth Brass Band. They’ve been mixing jazz, hip-hop and funk with the city’s centuries-old second line tradition (of brass band music at funeral parades) since 1983. Catch them at their regular haunt, the Maple Leaf, as I did, and you won’t be disappointed. Then we head to Nashville, to meet country’s first huge star, Kitty Wells with It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels – the genre’s first No 1 single, in 1952. She laid the groundwork for later Nashville-made stars such as Dolly Parton, Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift, and her lyrics are impressively forthright to boot: “Too many times married men think they’re still single,” she burrs.The first ever rock‘n’roll song was also made in Tennessee, down the Interstate 40 in Memphis. Rocket 88 was credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, but the band were actually Ike Turner’s (who the world would know more of later). Their song jangles and shudders like the promise of a new dawn. The first song about rock‘n’roll fame came from the south too – enter Louisiana boy Johnny B Goode. He lives “among the evergreens”, Chuck Berry tells us, and plays his guitar down by the railroad track his mum says someday he’ll be the leader of “a big old band”, and the song’s still so thrilling, you believe her. A few years later, a white boy from Tupelo came to Memphis too soon after, Elvis Presley was a worldwide sensation. Memphis, Tennessee is about a longing for home that has a sad twist in its tale, but the tune has a wiggle in its hips, as do Presley’s vocals. Staying in Memphis with Stax Records – one of America’s most supreme soul labels – it’s Sam and Dave, and what is arguably the greatest song they ever released, Soul Man.A quick dash across states follows, with Ray Charles and Georgia On My Mind. His 1960 single is even more moving when you realise he’s talking about his home (although the 1930 original was written by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell about Carmichael’s sister, Georgia). The south can be intriguingly rural too. Georgia boys R.E.M. made Automatic for the People in New Orleans, and their gorgeous instrumental named after the city is full of Louisiana’s heady strangeness. Then we zip back to their old friends, the B-52s, “heading down the Atlanta highway” to find their Love Shack. A party spirit thrives on open roads of the south, and it’s here in spades – and in squeals.Next, we venture into downtown Atlanta, where so many rappers made their names. Elevators (Me \u0026amp You) tells the story of how Outkast made it in the city, years before international fame hit with Hey Ya! Another tale of how the south leaves you wanting more, Tennessee Song, comes from contemporary country star Margo Price, who’s signed to Jack White’s Third Eye Records in Nashville. We finish our journey with one of today’s greatest pop stars, Atlanta’s Janelle Monae, who reminds us how America’s rock‘n’roll spirit lives on in our time. Play all these songs loud. You’ll probably fall in love too.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f01879a1f09968611897e8031e2ee41ace4d0ef9/0_93_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75ba008b4290cf448719bae1c2775129","title":"north korea us summit on track says moon candid talks friend kim jong un","story":"Donald Trump confirmed on Sunday that US negotiators were in North Korea for talks ahead of his planned summit with Kim Jong-un – a meeting the US president said was cancelled only three days before.“Our United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself,” the US president tweeted. “I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day. Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this. It will happen!”The Washington Post first reported that the US officials had crossed into North Korea. The Post said Sung Kim, US ambassador to the Philippines, was with Allison Hooker, Korea expert on the White House National Security Council, and a Pentagon official and had met Choe Son Hui, the North Korean vice-foreign minister.Later, a state department spokeswoman said the US delegation was in “ongoing talks with North Korean officials at Panmunjom”, a village on the border between North and South Korea. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said a “pre-advance team” had left for Singapore to work on logistics. Before Trump’s supposed cancellation of the meeting on Thursday, the summit had been set for 12 June.On Saturday, South Korean president Moon Jae-in met Kim Jong-un in a surprise move. On Sunday Moon said Kim was committed to meeting Trump and achieving complete denuclearisation. Amid hugs and smiles, Moon met Kim on the North Korean side of Panmunjom, the site of their first meeting a month earlier. The atmosphere was “just like an ordinary meeting between friends” and the two held “candid talks”, Moon said. A video released by the South Korean presidential office had the audio replaced with dramatic music, showing the two men embracing, both with wide smiles.The spontaneous offer by Kim to meet, and Moon’s quick acceptance, showed how close the two leaders have become. It capped a whirlwind 24 hours of diplomacy as Moon scrambled to salvage the summit between Trump and Kim. On Saturday evening at the White House, as Moon was briefing reporters on his meeting with Kim, Trump suggested a climbdown was possible.“We’re doing very well in terms of the summit with North Korea,” Trump said. “It’s moving along very nicely. So we’re looking at 12 June in Singapore. That hasn’t changed. So, we’ll see what happens.”Michael Hayden, a former director of the CIA, was less sure Trump would have an advantage. He told ABC’s This Week: “Kim Jong-un knows his programme inside and out. I think he knows what he can concede. I don’t know that the president has done the kind of homework that would allow him to do this.” Discussing the Saturday talks, Moon said Kim “once again committed to complete denuclearisation”. But he repeatedly refused to answer questions on how North Korea would relinquish its nuclear weapons or if it would allow international experts to inspect nuclear facilities, issues which have hung over discussions between Washington and Pyongyang.US officials have demanded North Korea unilaterally disarm before earning concessions on sanctions or a pledge of non-aggression. Pyongyang prefers phased negotiations and concessions. Kim expressed “his fixed will on the historic” meeting with Trump, according to the North’s state-run Korean Central News Agency. Photos of the Moon-Kim meeting were printed on the front of the Rodong Sinmun, the Workers’ party newspaper. “It’s strategically smart for Kim to invite Moon for a face to face meeting, it helps portray him in the public eye as a very friendly, diplomacy-oriented statesman,” said Jenny Town, managing editor of monitoring group 38 North. “It really offsets the tone Kim’s regime has put forward with statements threatening nuclear war.”But Town warned there was still a chasm between Washington and Pyongyang on core issues, saying there was little point in holding a summit that lacked substance.“This is not diplomacy, it’s political theatre,” she said. “There is no trust between the two right now, so why would Kim trust any US security guarantee on paper? Trust on both sides need to be built over time and no one should expect Trump to fly to Singapore and leave with all of North Korea’s nukes.” Moon said: “The path to complete denuclearisation and full peace was never going to be an easy one.” He added: “I’m sure we will succeed.”Moon also said he hoped there could be a meeting between North Korea, South Korea and the US to formally end the Korean war, which ceased with an armistice in 1953. He praised Kim for announcing a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests, as well as the closing of a nuclear test site this week. The two sides are set to hold “high-level talks” on 1 June as well as military discussions and efforts to set up reunions between ided families."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/976c2bbc132a348fba2cdc30b647ce8a86aab07e/0_3_2491_1495/master/2491.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e05e9b0831cf258f018487bc995f58a7","title":"colombia presidential elections ivan duque gustavo petro runoff","story":"Iván Duque, a fierce critic of the peace accord, will face-off against former mayor of Bogotá Gustavo Petro in second roundColombians have failed to elect a president outright, setting the stage for a bitter runoff between two frontrunners from opposite ends of the political spectrum, while a peace process with leftist rebels hangs in the balance.While voters were united in their distrust of establishment politicians, the campaign highlighted increasing polarisation, with Duque campaigning on a platform of market-friendly economics and Petro criticising the multinational mining companies that operate in the country.Some voters were also worried that with a leftist at the helm could mean their country follows neighbouring Venezuela toward economic ruin – a crisis that has caused more than a million Venezuelans to flee to Colombia. Petro was once a vocal supporter of Hugo Chávez, the late Venezuelan president whom many blame for that country’s woes.Sunday’s vote took on extra significance, marking the first presidential elections since a peace deal was reached between the government and leftist rebel group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (or Farc). That deal formally ended five decades of war that left 220,000 dead and 7 million displaced but failed to win over voters who in late 2016 rejected the deal in a referendum. The peace process was the initiative of outgoing president, Juan Manuel Santos, who won the Nobel peace prize for his achievement.Though the deal was amended and ratified in congress, promises of softer sentencing for rebels and guaranteed seats in congress proved a step too far for many Colombians who saw Sunday’s vote as a second referendum.Duque – now the clear favourite to take the presidency in June – is opposed to the peace deal. His mentor and ally, former president Álvaro Uribe, remains a powerful figure in Colombian politics, having long been fiercely critical of the peace process.Petro once belonged to the long-defunct M-19 guerrilla group and supports the deal. But unless he can convince more moderates to swell his movement, his chances of winning next month are remote.Election day began in a leaden mood beneath a leaden sky, with Santos casting his vote in the courtyard of Bogotá’s magnificent neoclassical Congress building, and addressing reporters. “These are the best-attended elections ever,” he said, “in a country closer to peace than it has ever been.”He was followed, according to tradition, by his predecessor Uribe – whom Santos once served as defence minister but who has become his nemesis. Uribe placed his ballot paper and said: “I have voted for Iván Duque, because of his preparation for office, and his programme for security and respect for the law.” Soon afterwards, in the Asunción district on the edge of his electoral fortress in desperately poor barrios in the south of the city, Gustavo Petro arrived, pressing through crowds of supporters, to vote at the San Lucas school, converted to accommodate polling booths. “Uribe, can you hear us? Petro for president!” they chanted, and: “Gustavo, friend, the people are with you!” The candidate moved through his throng to the booth, accompanied by his daughter Antonella who was wearing the yellow colours of Colombia’s football team. “The future of all our sons and daughters depends on who wins this,” he said. “The more people vote, the more free citizens we will have. I promise a humane Colombia We will improve health and education, challenge corruption and pursue peace.” Duque had earlier voted at the National Institute of Pedagogy, as though to demonstrate the bitter polarisation in this country, proceeding to hear midday Mass at Our Lady of Lourdes church in the historic Chapinero district, where his well-heeled supporters packed the aisles. Duque was whisked in via a rear entrance by his armoured convoy, taking a front pew with his wife, Beatriz. A benediction was sung – bizarrely – to the tune of The Beatles Hey Jude and while the audience sat, upright, Duque lowered his head in prayer, before falling – while others stood – to his knees.The peace accord has had a rocky ride in the run-up to this decisive moment. Clause one commits a government to “integrated rural reform”, while clause four demands the voluntary and enforced eradication, and substitution of coca. Both have met with ferocious opposition: 160 indigenous and land rights leaders have been assassinated, and war rages over coca production between government forces and a mesh of mafia interests and Farc dissidents and other criminal syndicates connected to big landowners. The worst violence is in the Tumaco region on the Pacific coast, the most intensive – and contested – coca-growing region in the world. Duque has consistently refused to uphold both clauses, while Petro and Fajardo are committed to continuing the peace process.A final televised debate on Friday night focused almost entirely on the accord. Duque said it had “bamboozled the Colombians”, while Petro insisted: “The peace is not a problem of negotiation with the guerrillas, but an agreement with society to live without violence.” In a debate the previous evening, Fajardo said, aiming at Duque: “That would be a bad thing: a president who does not want peace.” Out in the countryside, the tension has been palpable. Carlos Castilla is one of those working on the front line of the accord’s implementation, for a ision of the agriculture ministry, helping coca growers substitute their crop with licit alternatives. “Peace”, he said, in the tropical wilderness around Tumaco, “is not something you just sign, it is something you build.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c335a0eb394dbfcb75ef53a8d0e461d6f1f4e68/0_192_3132_1879/master/3132.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c05b1808a1fda2abbb61627e8747ad6","title":"italy president sergio mattarella names interim prime minister carlo cottarelli","story":"Sergio Mattarella asks former IMF economist Carlo Cottarelli to try to form a governmentItaly’s president has formally asked Carlo Cottarelli to try to form a government after quashing the hopes of the Five Star Movement and Lega to form western Europe’s first populist government.Sergio Mattarella turned to the former International Monetary Fund economist to run a technocratic government until a fresh election can be held.

New Zealand is the canary in the coal mine, if we can’t deal with it, who can?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e87184b567b48ea60b54dec68002620231598104/0_211_4176_2505/master/4176.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccc1c0cb7a17bf4590663f0a62770f28","title":"spider man of paris to get french citizenship after rescuing child","story":"Malian migrant who climbed four storeys thanked by President Emmanuel MacronA Malian migrant hailed as a hero for scaling a building in Paris to save a four-year-old child hanging from a balcony is to be granted French citizenship.Mamoudou Gassama took just seconds to reach the child in a rescue captured on film and viewed millions of times online.After meeting Gassama at the Élysée Palace on Monday morning, President Emmanuel Macron thanked the 22-year-old and said he would be made a naturalised citizen. Macron also said he would be given a role as a volunteer firefighter.Gassama told the French broadcaster BFMTV that when he saw the child clinging on to the fourth-floor balcony, “I did not think, I saved him”.He said: “When I took him in my arms, I spoke with him and asked: ‘Why did you do that?’ But he did not answer.”The incident took place at about 8pm on Saturday in northern Paris.Footage of the rescue shows Gassama pulling himself up the building from balcony to balcony as a man tries to hold on to the child. On reaching the fourth floor, Gassama puts one leg over the balcony before reaching out with his right arm and grabbing the child.Firefighters arrived at the scene to find the child had already been rescued.“Luckily, there was someone who was physically fit and who had the courage to go and get the child,” a fire service spokesman said.Tracked down by reporters a day later, Gassama said he had acted without thinking. “I saw all these people shouting and cars sounding their horns. I climbed up like that and, thank God, I saved the child,” he said.Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, praised Gassama on Twitter for his “act of bravery” and phoned him to “thank him warmly”. She described him as the “Spider-Man of the 18th”, referring to the Paris district where the rescue happened.“He explained to me that he had arrived from Mali a few months ago dreaming of building his life here,” she said. “I told him that his heroic act is an example to all citizens and that the city of Paris will obviously be very keen to support him in his efforts to settle in France.”According to initial inquiries by the authorities, the child’s parents were not at home when the incident occurred. The father was questioned by police for having left his child unattended and was due in court later, a judicial source said. The child’s mother was not in Paris at the time."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3511273.1527510914!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"6km section of connemara greenway opens to cyclists","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Connemara greenway is set to run between Galway and Clifden.

Photograph: PA Wire Theresa May has strung herself and her government up on a DUP hook from which there is apparently no escaping. Short, that is, of telling the unionists she has no choice but to make a commitment to the possibility of customs controls on the Irish Sea to secure the greater objective of a frictionless border between North and South.Last week she was told by the EU in Brexit talks in no uncertain terms that her complex formula for sidestepping the “backstop” commitment she made in December – or, rather, reinterpreting it - is a complete non-runner. She must now go back to the drawing board and produce a new way of operationalising the backstop that reflects the uncomfortable promises made in December. This backstop ensures no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland in the event there is no agreed solutions on how to avoid a hard border. And she must do so fast as a June summit is looming. How she ever thought it would be a runner is not clear, as one senior EU official close to the talks admitted. “You are not the only one to be confused here,” he told this correspondent at a post-talks briefing. Mrs May has struggled with the reality that in December, in order to demonstrate “sufficient progress” and see talks move on to their next stage, the backstop commitment was conceded as a guaranteed fallback to the EU for the Withdrawal Agreement in case longer-term talks failed to produce a borderless EU-UK trade deal. It is now enshrined in draft, unagreed form in a special protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement.Under pressure from unionists opposed to controls on the Irish Sea – inevitable if Northern Ireland is treated as a separate case – Mrs May has delayed and fudged in the Northern Ireland strand of talks in the hope that the guarantee might not be necessary. But the EU wants a firm legal commitment by June. And there is no sign of an alternative long-term solution yet.And May has been suggesting in recent weeks that the customs provisions suggested in the backstop should be extended on a UK-wide basis to obviate the need for any separate treatment of Northern Ireland goods. This would be on a strictly time-limited basis, she insisted, so that the UK’s ambitions to sign separate trade deals would not be unduly inhibited. Two problems: the time limit undoes the guarantee element of the backstop and the UK was only committing to the customs element of the backstop, not its full regulatory alignment. Absent the latter there can be no frictionless Border.The UK had refused to discuss the backstop issue in the Ireland talks strand last week, but, to the surprise of EU negotiators, sought to raise it in the “future relationship” discussions in another room. “We have not addressed these issues in the context in which they need to be addressed,” the EU official complained.“They did, however, in the beginning of the meeting on the future partnership,” he said, “refer to the fact that Mrs May remains determined to address the Irish Border issue through the overall EU-UK relationship.“They said that they are currently discussing only the customs dimension of the backstop and that they are looking at making that EU-UK-wide. At the same time they said that they recognise that the Article 50 agreement (Withdrawal Agreement) protocol could not set out the permanent long-term EU-UK customs relationship.” So was the official, he confessed. Progress can’t be made to the June “sufficient progress” talks yardstick unless, he insisted, “we have a recognition that the backstop has to be Northern Ireland-specific. And we do away with the fantasy that there is an all-UK solution to that.“And we need to have the recognition that regulatory alignment for Northern Ireland is the key to avoiding a border. “Progress at this stage seems elusive – substantive progress even more so.” The EU now awaits, within two weeks at most, an explanation in writing of how the agreed backstop will be operationalised and the legal language for it for the Withdrawal Agreement. Arlene Foster can expect an uncomfortable call from Downing Street.As for the longer term future relationship discussions on trade and customs, we are still awaiting a British position. These too require agreed text for October, a broad political outline to accompany the Withdrawal Treaty. On this time is also running out, and the UK will have to come off the fence soon.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

Photograph: Chris Kleponis Con artists have always been slithering around. Huckleberry Finn tangled with flimflam men on Mississippi riverboats. There was a flirty snake-oil salesman in Oklahoma!  And Marian the Librarian fell in love with a charming charlatan, professor Harold Hill, in The Music Man.It was all part of an amusing American tradition of rapscallions doing their little side hustles. But now narcissistic con artists are dominating the main stage, soaring to great heights and spectacularly exploding. We have one running amok in the Oval. And we have one who finally turned himself in at a Tribeca police station Friday. Shakespeare in Love was good. But Harvey in handcuffs was great. Harvey Weinstein spent many years prosecuting his nefarious schemes against women before women ensured his prosecution.Elizabeth Holmes shot to fame as the youngest female self-made billionaire after she dropped out of Stanford at 19 and then founded the company that became Theranos. She claimed to have created an easier, cheaper way to do blood tests, just by pricking a finger, but then it turned out she was a literal bloodsucker, defrauding investors of $700 million on a nonexistent technology. As Maria Konnikova wrote in her book, The Confidence Game, “The whirlwind advance of technology heralds a new golden age of the grift. Cons thrive in times of transition and fast change” when we are losing the old ways and open to the unexpected.We are easy marks for faux Nigerian princes now, when chaos rules, the American identity wobbles, and technology is transforming our lives in awe-inspiring and awful ways. Trump voters allowed themselves to believe they had a successful billionaire who knew the art of the deal when he only knew the art of the con. They bought his seductive campaign narrative, that the system was rigged and corrupt and only he could fix it. After winning by warning voters they were being suckered, he’s made them all suckers.Those who ignored whispers about Weinstein’s grotesque behaviour burned to believe that Hollywood was more than juvenile comic-book movies, that it could still make classy, sophisticated films with great roles for mature actresses like Meryl Streep and Judi Dench. And despite tales of misogyny and sickening transgressions, they wanted to buy Harvey’s grand narrative, that he was a liberal feminist who could raise enough money to help elect the first woman president. With Holmes, people were longing for a young woman to break into the club of boy geniuses conjuring unicorns.She played to that, imitating Steve Jobs by wearing a black turtleneck and driving a car with no licence plate. She pitched a Jobs-like mythic story about her company, that it was not merely about making money, it was designed to be “the most important thing humanity has ever built.” High-minded elites like to scornfully say that Trump voters fell for his scam because they were ignorant and racist. But the high-minded elites fell for Holmes’s scam, even the fake deep authoritative voice she put on. Her board had George Shultz, Henry Kissinger, Jim Mattis and David Boies Rupert Murdoch and Robert Kraft were investors.“It’s a controversial thing to say now, but Holmes wowed all these older men and wrapped them around her finger with her charm and youth and good looks and cool vision,” says John Carreyrou, the Wall Street Journal reporter who broke the scam story and who wrote a book, Bad Blood, about it. Carreyrou says Silicon Valley has always had “a flimflam element” and a “fake it ‘til you make it” ethos, from the early 1980s, when it was selling vaporware (hardware or software that was more of a concept or work in progress than a workable reality).“We’ve been lionising and revering these young tech entrepreneurs, treating them not just like princes and princesses but like heroes and icons,” Carreyrou says. “Now that there’s a backlash to Silicon Valley, it will be interesting to see if we reconsider this view that just because you made a lot of money doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re a role model for boys and girls.”Jaron Lanier, the scientist and musician known as the father of virtual reality, has a new book out, Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now. He says the business plans of Facebook and Google have served to “elevate the role of the con artist to be central in society”.“Anytime people want to contact each other or have an awareness of each other, it can only be when it’s financed by a third party who wants to manipulate us, to change us in some way or affect how we vote or what we buy,” he says. “In the old days, to be in that unusual situation, you had to be in a cult or a volunteer in an experiment in a psychology building or be in an abusive relationship or at a bogus real estate seminar.“But now you just need to sign on to Facebook to find yourself in a behaviour modification loop, which is the con. And this may destroy our civilisation and even our species.”Lanier worries, now that tech has lost its halo, that there is nothing optimistic to replace it. “We don’t believe in government,” he says. “A lot of people are pissed at media. They don’t like education. People who used to think the FBI was good now think it’s terrible. With all of these institutions the subject of ridicule, there’s nothing – except Skinner boxes and con artists.”Read more about how and why Donald Trump\u0027s administration is sending shockwaves

resistant to climate change, pests and disease but also fortified with vital vitamins and minerals.The initiative could save the lives of hundreds of thousands of children who die each year from poor nutrition in developing countries as well as supplementing diets in the west.The Department for International Development (Dfid) has quietly invested more than £100m into breeding the new generation of super-crops which now stand poised to create what experts are calling a “second green revolution”.The crops include iron-rich beans that can withstand a 4 degree Celsius jump in temperature,

If we can reach our target of 1bn, then potentially it is the next biggest thingHowarth Bouis, a US economistImportantly, they have been created through traditional breeding techniques rather than being genetically modified which means they can be planted without waiting for regulatory approval.“The first green revolution reached at least one billion people and was a huge success. If we can reach our target of one billion, then potentially it is the next biggest thing,” said Howarth Bouis, a US economist whose organisation HarvestPlus has received £87.4m from Dfid to breed and distribute crop varieties fortified with Vitamin A, Iron and Zinc.About 30 million people – around six million households – have so far benefited from the new crops, primarily in Africa, but the aim is to reach one billion by 2030. A further six million farmers in Asia are using scuba rice but the aim is 18 million by 2028.Scientists believe that if they achieve the one billion target they will effectively halve the world’s estimated two billion suffering from what is known as “hidden hunger” or micronutrient malnutrition.The first green revolution, which occurred in the early to mid 1900s, won its instigator Norman Borlaug a Nobel Peace Prize and spawned disease-resistant, high-yielding wheat strains which are credited with saving 250 million lives worldwide.Agricultural breakthroughs trump medical innovations such as antibiotics and vaccinations for lives saved historically because food is so central to life.It is estimated one million children a year die from micronutrient malnutrition which leaves them prone to stunted growth, poor vision and illnesses and diseases that have the potential to become worldwide epidemics.Agronomist Norman Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supplyThe new super-crops not only replicate the traits of the first green revolution in having higher yields but also have been – or are being – cross-bred further to incorporate genes that protect from disease, pests, floods, drought and heat.“Our centres are developing climate adaptive crops. Farmers like them not only because they are climate tolerant but also high yielding. We just need to get them into mainstream markets and piggy back on them with our vitamin strains,” said Bouis.For the “heat-beater” beans, a staple in Rwanda where the fortified varieties provide up to half a person’s recommended daily intake of iron, scientists in Colombia trawled a gene bank of 36,000 samples to find a Mexican strain capable of withstanding temperature rises expected over the next century due to climate change.Biofortification | Super-crops heralding the next green revolutionIt will not only safeguard the 50 per cent of land that would have been lost to farmers due to higher temperatures but could also open up new markets in tropical areas for the beans.“Even if they can only handle a three-degree rise, that would still limit the land lost to climate change to about 5 per cent,” said Steve Beebe, head of bean breeding for the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture.Scuba rice was created after scientists tracked down an Indian rice variety with a gene, SUB1A, which was activated when the plant was submerged. It was crossed with India’s top-selling, high-yielding Swarni rice to counter the annual loss of 4m tonnes of rice to flooding in India and Bangladesh, enough to feed 30m people.Dr Uma Shankar Singh, a director of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), said: “Sustaining productivity is the most important factor and we now have six million farmers cultivating 3 million hectares. At minimum it is adding 3 million tonnes of rice. We have also developed SUB1 varieties with salt, drought and stagnant flooding tolerance.”Biofortified beans in RwandaDfid is now the biggest funder of HarvestPlus, whose work into fortified crops was started in 2003. Nottingham University professor Martin Broadley, a research fellow with Dfid, said the genesis of the programme came from research showing how expensive and inefficient it was to deliver supplements or fortified processed foods like bread to rural areas.“Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approaches,” he said.According to the World Health Organization, every $10-$15 invested in, for example, the vitamin A rich orange sweet potato produces one extra year of good quality life per inidual..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approachesProfessor Martin Broadley, Nottingham UniversityHarvestPlus deliberately spurned genetic modification in favour of natural methods. “If we’d invested our money in GM, they could have been left sitting on the shelf. Conventional breeding is not as powerful a science but at least we can do a lot of good with it without the blockages you have with transgenics,” said Bouis.Government agriculture centres and NGOs are supporting the distribution of the seeds. As it seeks to reach 1 billion, Dfid has put in an extra £4 million to get private seed producers to take up the “super-crops” and achieve the necessary increase in uptake.The roll-out of the seeds has been supported by promotions including a radio soap opera, My Children, in Uganda to advance the orange sweet potato, a rap song by Rwandan musicians to encourage use of iron-rich beans and Yellow Cassava, a Nollywood (Nigerian Hollywood) film highlighting the nutritional benefits of the vitamin A rich crop.Women clear wet mud alongside the bank of the river in Satkhira, Bangladesh. Bangladesh is one of the continental countries most vulnerable to climate change.At least 14 studies are being carried out to establish whether eating the fortified crops improve the health of the communities consuming them. The early results are encouraging.In Uganda, the orange sweet potato, taken up by 60 per cent of farms in the area studied, saw a significant increase in vitamin A uptake among families, a 9 per cent fall in those with low vitamin A and a drop of up to 19 per cent in diarrhoea among children.Children eating orange maize in Zambia saw improvements in their sight through increased vitamin A. Women given fortified beans in Rwanda reversed their iron deficiency, reducing anaemia. College students in Rwanda aged 17 to 25 who ate the beans scored significantly better in cognitive tests of memory and speed after just 18 weeks.Studies into whether eating fortified crops improves the health of the communities have yielded promising resultsA Dfid spokesman said: “Biofortification is highly cost-effective as it provides a single intervention which benefits both this generation and future generations to come. By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are already vitamin-rich, with no need for additional supplements.“The crops remain high yielding and vitamin rich for future harvests. This compares with supplements which need to be repeated, or fortification which needs to be continuously added to food products.”More controversially, Dfid is backing one of a potential new generation of GM crops now closing in on market readiness. It is funding work on modifying plants’ photosynthetic efficiency so their water use is cut by 25 per cent by changing the expression of a single gene.A potential breakthrough has also emerged in Mozambique’s field trials of more water-efficient GM maize (WEMA). Early results suggest it is not only resistant to drought but also the devastating stem borer and fall army worm pests.Ohio State University scientists are working to create a GM “golden potato”, which would provide 42 per cent of a child’s daily vitamin A.By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are vitamin-richUganda is trialling a “golden banana” high in vitamin A created by Australia’s Queensland University of Technology by inserting a gene from a Papua New Guinea banana into the commercially-successful Cavendish banana.It is named after William Cavendish, the sixth Duke of Devonshire, a passionate horticulturalist who developed it on his Derbyshire estate in the 19th century.Public and political scepticism, however, remains a major hurdle for GM. The salutary lesson on this is “golden rice”, a GM strain engineered to boost vitamin A. More than a decade after it was hailed as a potential game-changer, its progress to farmers’ fields has stalled in a blizzard of regulation and public opposition.If the next green revolution is to come, harnessing nature rather than genetically modifying it may prove to be quickest and most efficient route.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Murder inquiry launched after man killed in hit and runGirl Guides to learn how to be good with money with new \u0026#34saver badge\u0026#34Harry and Meghan to visit Canada on honeymoon, reports suggest Family of woman bludgeoned to death say \u0026#39light in our life is extinguished\u0026#39 Westworld, season 2, episode 6, Phase Space recap: a shocking return for a familiar faceItalian president gives former IMF official mandate to be prime minister, as populists prepare for fresh electionsBank holiday Monday weather: flash floods in Midlands claim first victimApparatus brings black comedy to Kafka\u0026#39s tale of torture – Brighton Fringe, review France grants honorary citizenship to hero ‘spiderman’ migrant who scaled Paris building to save four-year oldWest Midlands hit by flash floods overnightGirl, 18, died at Mutiny Festival \u0026#39after taking two pills\u0026#39 as second victim identified as a young fatherThe 8 things you might have missed this weekend\u0026#39Pay-as-you-go\u0026#39 bin scheme \u0026#39could leave households £50 a year worse off\u0026#39 Butchers \u0026#39living in fear\u0026#39 as vegan attacks on the rise, says Countryside AllianceLords’ Speaker adds support to call for John Bercow bullying investigationItaly\u0026#39s populist parties vent their fury as attempt to form a government collapses over choice of staunchly anti-euro economistA Very English Scandal, episode two, review: Ben Whishaw is a delight in this raucous adapation of the Thorpe affairPatrick Melrose, episode 3 review: a frothy game of existential CluedoNHS needs extra funds for a \u0026#39technological revolution\u0026#39 in order to survive, Jeremy Hunt saysAmbitious trade deals won\u0026#39t be possible if UK stays in version of customs union, Boris Johnson warnsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"giant panda cub makes first appearance","story":"A giant panda cub has made her first public debut aged five-months-old.

team denies claims match fixing test against","story":"Aneel Munawar in undercover recordings The England cricket team has been forced to deny outrageous match-fixing claims after a documentary alleged that a Test match against India was rigged. In an unprecedented statement, the English Cricket Board (ECB) said that there is nothing we have seen that would make us doubt any of our players in any way whatsoever in the face of claims of spot fixing during the 2016 match in Chennai. Tom Harrison, Chief Executive Officer of the ECB, said that they had discussed the documentary claims with all of the players, adding: They emphatically deny the allegations, have stated categorically that the claims are false and they have our full support.“Neither ECB nor the International Cricket Council (ICC) is aware any credible evidence connecting any England players to any form of corruption.An undercover journalist, posing as a businessman looking to place bets on the match, filmed a match fixer claiming that he had three England players with whom he arranged spot fixes during the Test in 2016.Aneel Munawar, who is accused of working for organised crime syndicate D Company, was recorded boasting that he has been fixing matches for six or seven years and can fix up to 60 to 70 per-cent of matches with players in every team. I\u0027m telling you, each script I give you will happen, happen and happen, he said. Joe Root, England\u0026#39s Test Captain, described the allegations as \u0026#39ridiculous\u0026#39Just before the 2016 match began he called a middle-man working for the reporters to tell him how players would perform at certain points in the game. Though his predictions have not been revealed, Al Jazeera\u0027s documentary Cricket’s Match Fixers claimed that they were accurate. The England  players alleged to have been involved, who have not been named, told the documentary makers that they categorically deny allegations made by a source who is a known criminal.The fixers were also caught discussing  plans to rig the outcome of England’s first Test in Sri Lanka, scheduled to begin on November 6, by doctoring the pitch to make it impossible for the contest to end in a draw.Tharange Indika, a groundsman at Galle International Stadium, was suspended by the Executive Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket whilst investigations take place. He denies all allegations against him.\u0027Spot fixing\u0027, which hit the headlines eight years ago when three Pakistan players were jailed over the practice in one of the sport\u0027s biggest scams, has become increasingly common in recent years as it is much harder to detect than throwing an entire match and provides more opportunity for bets. One former international cricketer previously accused of match fixing, whose identity was concealed, told Al Jazeera: They give them expensive gifts, like  Rolex watches. They give them houses, flats, cars.They send beautiful girls to the players, like models, so they get involved with them.He claimed that cheating players could earn up to £200,000 a game and were trapped into fixing matches. Joe Root, England\u0027s Test Captain, described the allegations against his team as ridiculous. I am aware that there is a documentary and it is outrageous that our players have been accused. All the players have the full backing of the ECB, he told a press conference. He said that they are concentrating on the cricket ahead of the second Test against Pakistan after losing Sunday\u0027s first Test, adding: “All the players have been briefed by the ECB, and been told there\u0027s absolutely nothing to worry about.Similar claims have been made against two Australian players in relation to their match against India at Ranchi in March 2017. Cricket bosses there have issued an equally vociferous denials. The ICC has launched an investigation into the claims made by the documentary, saying that it takes them very seriously.Repeated requests for disclosure of full evidence from the 18 month investigation have not yet been complied with, the governing body said. Munawar has declined to comment since undercover reporters revealed their identity. Murder inquiry launched after man killed in hit and runGirl Guides to learn how to be good with money with new \u0026#34saver badge\u0026#34Harry and Meghan to visit Canada on honeymoon, reports suggest Family of woman bludgeoned to death say \u0026#39light in our life is extinguished\u0026#39 Westworld, season 2, episode 6, Phase Space recap: a shocking return for a familiar faceItalian president gives former IMF official mandate to be prime minister, as populists prepare for fresh electionsBank holiday Monday weather: flash floods in Midlands claim first victimApparatus brings black comedy to Kafka\u0026#39s tale of torture – Brighton Fringe, review France grants honorary citizenship to hero ‘spiderman’ migrant who scaled Paris building to save four-year oldWest Midlands hit by flash floods overnightGirl, 18, died at Mutiny Festival \u0026#39after taking two pills\u0026#39 as second victim identified as a young fatherThe 8 things you might have missed this weekend\u0026#39Pay-as-you-go\u0026#39 bin scheme \u0026#39could leave households £50 a year worse off\u0026#39 Butchers \u0026#39living in fear\u0026#39 as vegan attacks on the rise, says Countryside AllianceLords’ Speaker adds support to call for John Bercow bullying investigationItaly\u0026#39s populist parties vent their fury as attempt to form a government collapses over choice of staunchly anti-euro economistA Very English Scandal, episode two, review: Ben Whishaw is a delight in this raucous adapation of the Thorpe affairPatrick Melrose, episode 3 review: a frothy game of existential CluedoNHS needs extra funds for a \u0026#39technological revolution\u0026#39 in order to survive, Jeremy Hunt saysAmbitious trade deals won\u0026#39t be possible if UK stays in version of customs union, Boris Johnson warnsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/09/05/TELEMMGLPICT000043134890_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkOwR0iP77jSmoq9t8DUmdpoeWhrs_rFJRBZ2-2XkJAA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"pay as you go bin scheme could leave households 50 year worse","story":"Overflowing wheelie bins in SouthamptonA new pay-as-you-throw recycling scheme being planned by councils will cost homeowners as much as £50 extra per year unless food packaging is overhauled, waste experts have warned.The controversial pay-as-you-throw collection scheme, proposed by council chiefs, is designed to encourage people to recycle more by charging them for the weight of the general waste they put out.But according to one of Britain\u0027s biggest waste collection companies the move could leave millions of families worse off unless food manufacturers are forced to improve the recyclability of packaging. Today Suez is calling for the Government to force food manufacturers to make all packaging sold in the UK at least 50 per cent recyclable by 2025.At present less than 10 per cent of packaging is recyclable.Homeowners risk \u0026#039wasting their time\u0026#039 recycling because of confusion over what can be recycledWithout the increase, which would give households the opportunity to recycle more, they could find their council bills rise by £50 a year under a pay-as-you throw system, it warned. A pay-as-you-throw system for household black bin rubbish should be phased in by 2030 as part of a revolution in boosting recycling and efficient use of materials, Suez said.The call comes as a poll reveals that almost a quarter of people feel sandwich packaging or fast food containers are the main cause of litter, while almost a fifth (18 per cent) think crisp packets and sweet wrappers are most to blame. And one in seven (14 per cent) thought plastic bottles were the main problem, the YouGov poll found.Suez said it wants producers to contribute more to the costs of collecting and recycling their products, such as coffee pods or pet-food pouches, and for them to operate refundable deposit systems for cans and plastic bottles.The UK\u0026#039s recycling rate has changed little over the yearsThe deposit scheme charging consumers a levy on their bottles or cans - which they can reclaim by returning them for recycling - should apply to on-the-go plastic drinks bottles less than 750 ml, and drinks cans, and the deposit should be set at 10p.Suez chief executive David Palmer-Jones said: We envisage a revolution, where the notion of \u0027waste\u0027 is consigned to the bin and, instead, we truly value the materials flowing around the economy.The advent of pay as your throw for black bag rubbish leaves a clear choice for households where they may see their council taxes rise if they throw away more that cannot be recycled.

None made last year’s top 10. Customers praised the smells of Lush stores, the prices at discount cosmetics store Savers, and the staff at Smyths Toys, Which? said.The survey also asked shoppers what they liked about shopping in-store and found customers value being able to touch, feel and try on items before purchasing (82 per cent) and being able to ask staff questions (39 per cent).But customers said they were put off by crowds (49 per cent), queueing (49 per cent) and the behaviour of other shoppers (38 per cent).Ben Clissitt, Which? magazine editor, said: “It is clear that our traditional high street is changing and while this is bad news for some retailers who have struggled to adapt, others have seized the opportunity to make their mark.“Our findings show that if retailers can strike the right balance between good value, quality products and first-class customer service, shoppers will keep coming back to their stores.”WHSmith has been contacted for comment.The top and bottom rated stores for 2018, according to the Which? survey of 10,356 shoppers is as follows.

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in AsiaBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars.

Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occurScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”.

In other cases vulnerable asylum seekers have been released onto the streets with no accommodation. One immigration law firm saying they were dealing with the problem on a daily basis.Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said the it was “cruel and callous” for the Home Office to hold asylum seekers with a right to live in the community in “prison style” removal centres, while Labour MP David Lammy said it was wrong to treat “innocent people like criminals”. It comes amid mounting criticism of the UK’s immigration detention system, which currently holds around 26,500 people each year and around 2,500 at any given time. Recent figures obtained by The Independent revealed at least one person a day needs medical treatment for self-harming in detention, while the prisons watchdog described conditions in the centres as “prison-like”.The government is already under intense scrutiny following the Windrush scandal, which revealed that Caribbean nationals who had lived in the UK for decades were wrongly detained in removal centres. As many as 5,000 Commonwealth citizens in Britain have since been identified as potentially having been deprived of their immigration rights.In January, the government repealed a law that had enabled homeless detainees to apply for accommodation from within detention if they had nowhere to reside when released. This meant around 2,000 detainees who previously applied for this support each year are no longer able to, according to charities.A separate accommodation provision is available for asylum seekers and failed asylum seekers if they would be destitute without it. But lawyers and groups working with detainees said this was difficult to obtain from within detention because they would fail the “destitution test”.One male asylum seeker was granted bail in March after spending 10 months in detention, but his application for asylum accommodation was rejected by the Home Office on the grounds that he was “not destitute by the fact that he is being housed and his dietary needs are catered to”.The refusal letter stated: “Detention is based around shared facilities (bedrooms, shower rooms and dining rooms) which is not dissimilar to emergency accommodation with lack of liberty being the main difference.”At least one person a day is self-harming in UK detention centresThe man’s grant of bail lapsed and he remained in detention.In another case, a man who came to the UK in 2003 after fleeing torture in his home country was granted bail in March on the condition that an address for accommodation would be provided by the Home Office.But the next day he was released with no address, and has since been relying on charities, asylum seekers and several iniduals of good will for support with housing and food.Toufique Hossain, director of public law at Duncan Lewis Solicitors, told The Independent his team was seeing the issue on a daily basis.“What we’re finding is that that Home Office is failing to provide accommodation in time. There are massive delays in them providing the accommodation, we’re talking months,” he said.“Immigration judges decide all the conditions are right for the person to be released and they direct the Home Office to provide accommodation. But then we’re seeing nothing.”Mr Hossain said that because the Home Office can’t be held in contempt of breaching a bail order, the department was often failing to act on providing accommodation unless the detainee issued unlawful detention proceedings.“If they’re fortunate enough to get a decent lawyer who will issue unlawful detention proceedings, they can get an order from the high court saying the Home Office must provide accommodation within a set period of time, and it does miraculously find accommodation,” he added.“They’re not prioritising it is because they’re immigrants, and it obviously costs money to provide accommodation.  In the meantime, people languish in detention at the cost to the taxpayer. The harm caused to people who have a legitimate right to be released is inexplicable.”Claire Sullivan, research and policy coordinator and charity Bail for Immigration Detainees (BID), said the vast majority of detainees the charity supports was no longer able to apply for accommodation support from the Home Office.Home Office keeping torture victims in detention, finds watchdog“As a consequence, many detainees are being indefinitely detained for no other reason than their lack of suitable accommodation. Others have been released by the Home Office to the streets, potentially into destitution,” she added.“As well as no application process, there is no appeal right for refusals to provide bail accommodation. Further, the Home Office does not provide reasons for refusals.”Jerome Phelps, director of charity Detention Action, accused the Home Officeof creating a “bureaucratic black hole” for people in detention.“People we work with are finding themselves detained in prison-like conditions indefinitely, with judges powerless to free them. Decisions by judges to order release become meaningless if the Home Office fails to provide the necessary address,” he said.“The lack of a time limit on detention makes it urgent that the department return to respecting the release decisions of the independent judiciary.”Responding to the findings, Ms Abbott said: “We have a legal and moral duty to treat refugees with fairness and humanity, but day after day we see just how cruel and callous the Tories’ hostile environment policy has become.“Detention centres with their prison-style security are not appropriate accommodation for asylum seekers that have been given the right to remain. This practice must end.”Mr Lammy echoed her view, saying: “It is totally wrong that the Home Office are holding asylum seekers in detention centres and treating innocent people like criminals.“The principle of habeas corpus is the founding principle of our legal system, and yet in 2018 the Home Office is unlawfully depriving people of their liberty. It is time for a review of the hostile environment policy that underpins this cruelty.”A Home Office spokesperson said it was aware of some cases of detainees waiting for accommodation to be allocated and that they were working closely with the accommodation providers, police and HM Prison and Probation Service to source suitable accommodation.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesChris Ashton of the Barbarians scores against England at Twickenham.

Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13Mr Kellner points out that Leave voters outnumber Remain by 1.3 million and that since the referendum roughly 1.2 million voters had died, while 1.4 million have entered voting age, meaning “demography has already reduced that lead by more than half”.However, he warned that even if a second referendum were to take place, Labour would have to “campaign actively to stay in the EU”.“This would, of course, require Jeremy Corbyn to abandon his past views of Brussels, which have ranged from lack of enthusiasm to outright hostility,” he added.Time to ‘face the reality’ of Brexit, EU’s chief negotiator tells UKUK exporters struggle with skills shortage as Brexit looms, study saysChaotic Brexit could force interest rate cut warns Mark CarneyAn exclusive survey for The Independent by BMG Research in December showed 51 per cent of people now backed remaining in the union, while 41 per cent still want Brexit.Legal challenges have also claimed another referendum is required before Britain can leave the EU.Campaigners say the 2011 “referendum lock” introduced by David Cameron prevents any significant change to relations with the EU without the public’s say, and therefore requires a second referendum.The news comes as Michel Barnier, the chief Brexit negotiator for the EU, told Britain to “face the reality” of Brexit, and warned against blaming the EU for any negative consequences it caused.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Civil liberties campaigners called on Sainsbury’s to ditch the surveillance screens, which were branded a “gross intrusion” of privacy and a “blatant attempt to intimidate customers”. One Sainsbury’s regular, who did not want to be named, told The Independent she had been a customer for decades but was “shocked” to find herself being filmed while purchasing her groceries at a branch in central London. “Not only does it feel like there is mistrust and that you are potentially guilty of something, but there’s also the fear they will be storing your data.” She added: “I shan’t be using their self-service machines ever again. I felt violated.”Sainsbury’s CEO sings ‘We’re in the Money’ before ITV News segment about £12bn merger with AsdaAnother shopper, Alex Durham, said he encountered the screens at an outlet in Fitzrovia, London. The 27-year-old filmmaker said: “It struck me as bizarre really. I don’t want to seem all tinfoil hat, but it just seemed a little bit Orwellian. “It’s a bit bizarre just to be looking at your face while you’re doing something, because it really feels like someone is over your shoulder while you’re just getting a packet of crisps and a coke.“It just felt a little bit strange.”After asking Sainsbury’s about the cameras, he was told they were to help “facilitate a better customer journey”. Other customers complained on social media to the supermarket. One said a screen “clearly” showed the pin machine, while another posted an image showing a Sainsbury’s monitor displaying a keypad. I took a photo this morning and you can clearly see the pin machine and keypad. I’ll be boycotting this store and any other store that has these screens. It’s insane. pic.twitterQqE2PINOsO“What’s up with recording customers entering their PINs at the self-checkout?” Gabriel Currie asked. One Twitter user said the CCTV meant you could see down my top and this image was displayed on the screen.Complaining to Sainsbury’s, Chloe Heatlie said: “It’s pretty creepy to be frank with you. Certainly didn’t benefit my customer experience.”Multiple social media users vowed to boycott the machines, and even Sainsbury’s itself, until the screens were removed.A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said the cameras were part of a “security measure” to increase safety at its stores. UK news in picturesUK news in picturesChris Ashton of the Barbarians scores against England at Twickenham.

The screens act as a deterrent to customers by making them more aware they are being watched.Silkie Carlo, director of civil liberties watchdog Big Brother Watch, said: “Sainsbury’s new self-surveillance screens are a gross intrusion of shoppers’ privacy, broadcasting the contents of our wallets and baskets. “These new cameras are a blatant attempt to intimidate customers and make us feel more closely watched than ever.“It is absolutely disgusting for Sainsbury’s to treat its loyal customers like criminals, especially as it is now nigh on impossible to get a human checkout. Big Brother Watch calls on Sainsbury’s to remove these surveillance screens urgently.”Sainsbury’s said it had installed the cameras at more than 300 stores, but refused to say if they would be rolled out to its remaining 1,100 outlets or whether the monitors were proving an effective deterrent.The supermarket said footage from its self-facing cameras, some of which were installed last year, were kept for 31 days before being overridden. According to a recent study, £3.2bn worth of goods is stolen from UK self-service tills every year. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Brussels’ decision to kick the UK out of the scheme was angrily denounced by ministers, with Philip Hammond, the chancellor, vowing to launch a separate satellite initiative if the EU refuses to back down.Tensions were already running high following days of strained negotiations in Brussels, during which one senior EU source described the UK’s demands as “fantasy”. Mr Hammond dismissed that remark as “not helpful”.Speaking at a legal conference in Lisbon, Mr Barnier noted the importance of agreeing how the relationship between the UK and the EU will be governed once Britain leaves the bloc.He said: “We have probably made a lot of progress on the substance of the withdrawal agreement, but without effective governance, these gains will be of limited value.“Because without agreement on governance, and without an agreement on Ireland and Northern Ireland, there will be no withdrawal agreement, and therefore no transition period.“The United Kingdom is well aware that our citizens and businesses, on both sides of the Channel, need legal certainty.”Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union.

The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13Hinting at continued frustration in Brussels over a perceived lack of detail in the UK’s negotiating demands, Mr Barnier urged ministers to be more “realistic” and warned them against playing a ‘blame game” with the EU.He said: “We also want an ambitious partnership with the United Kingdom in the long term. But to achieve this, we need realistic proposals from the UK – proposals that respect the institutional architecture and the integrity of the European Union.“I can see the temptation of the blame game to bring the negative consequences of Brexit on the European Union. But we will not be impressed. I will not be impressed.”He added: “For the economy, for foreign policy, the best way to influence the decisions of the European Union is to be in the European Union. The United Kingdom wants to leave. It’s its decision. Not ours. And that has consequences.“The United Kingdom must look at the reality of the European Union in the face. It must also face the reality of Brexit.”Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe EU and the UK are at loggerheads over how disputes will be settled after Brexit. Britain wants to establish a joint committee, with members appointed by political leaders, to resolve any issues that arise, but European leaders have insisted the ECJ must be given the final say.Ms May has previously insisted: “The jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK must end.”In a sign of the continued distance between the two negotiating teams, Mr Barnier said: “We cannot accept that a jurisdiction other that the Court of Justice of the European Union determines the law and imposes its interpretation on the institutions of the Union.”The former French minister said the EU was open to the UK changing its stance, but that time was running out.He said: “If the United Kingdom would like to change its own red lines, it must tell us. The sooner the better.“We are asking for clarity. A negotiation cannot be a game of hide and seek.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The two had been lovers after meeting in 1960 when being gay was banned.Scott, who worked as a model, was said to have had a full blown affair with the politician and even had liaisons in Thorpe’s Commons room.But after they parted, Thorpe was said to have viewed Scott as a dangerous blackmailer intent on revenge - something that could have wrecked his political ambitions.For while homosexuality was legalised in 1967 it was still taboo for people in the public eye.Scott had been lured on to Exmoor by a hitman, who was allegedly a part-time pilot called Andrew Newton who had been hired as part of the plot.He shot the model’s dog before turning the gun on Scott – but it jammed. Effing and jeffing, he sped off.After managing to hail down an approaching car, Scott blurted “Jeremy Thorpe” to the driver.A police investigation lead to a trial in the Old Bailey with the Liberal leader accused of conspiracy to murder along with three other men. But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime. And he was acquitted along with the others.But Scott maintains Thorpe wanted him dead and said he only felt safe when the politician died in 2014.His younger self has been played by actor Ben Wishaw in the new BBC drama starring Hugh Grant called Very English Scandal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408650365.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"apply here for our first summer internship scheme to work for the the number one paper","story":"The internships, for 18 to 25-year-olds, are available in roles including reporting, news-gathering, design and production, across print and online.Placements will last up to 12 weeks and be based mainly in London.

They have much to lose.Theresa May is demanding back the £1billion we put into this system.But that is chicken feed next to our £39billion divorce bill.She must insist not a penny is paid until we are reinstated in Galileo and a trade deal is signed.We were naive to imagine Brussels would be a friendly partner after Brexit.Its powerful bureaucrats are now nakedly and dangerously hostile.WOULD you pay £2,000 extra tax a year to keep the NHS afloat?

And it looks like there might be turbulent times ahead off-screen too.Actress Eleanor Tomlinson, who plays feisty Demelza, believes she should be paid the same as Aidan Turner, the star turn as Captain Ross.Eleanor isn’t sure how much Aidan takes home.But it has been confirmed this week that he tucks a heck of a lot more cash into his tight britches than her.Bosses at the company which makes the hugely successful Poldark series — back on TV next month — say it’s because he has significantly more screen time than any other character.I think they are quite right, and not just because of those half-naked scything scenes. As Ross Poldark, Aidan is ably supported by a splendid cast. But he carries the show and his character’s name is in the title.On the other hand, it was ludicrous that the luminous Claire Foy, who portrayed the Queen in The Crown, was paid less than Matt Smith, who played Prince Philip.Claire was the true shining star of this production and had more lines to learn, more scenes and many more long hours in front of the cameras than anyone else.Bosses were shamed into giving her £200,000 in back payments.I hope she enjoyed every well-earned penny, but she should actually have been paid a lot more than Matt.You also wouldn’t expect any actress playing Miss Marple to be paid the same as her male co-stars.She obviously deserves a bigger share of the pie, and likewise you wouldn’t for a minute acceptBrenda Blethyn being given equal pay with her young whipper-snapper sidekicks in Vera. She merits a far bigger salary.Brenda is the reason we tune in, and as the lead, she has more pressure to shoulder. Just like Poldark, if Vera had been a flop, then Brenda and Aidan would have taken all of the flak and their careers would have suffered.If actors and actresses are doing exactly the same work they should be paid exactly the same amount of money.That should apply across the board to every job in the land.It’s unfair for a female professor to earn less than her male counterpart, or someone working on the factory floor or in a shop to take home less just because she’s a woman.That’s why I was taken aback when new Strictly head judge Shirley Ballas defended the BBC for paying her less than her predecessor Len Goodman.Shirley graciously said it was because she was “on trial”. But I’m delighted that for her upcoming second series, bosses have apparently had a rethink.Whether this is because they feel Shirley has “proved herself” or is due to the outcry over equal pay, it is, at least, a baby step in the right direction.I would love to see the same applied in teaching, medicine, finance — every other job where men and women are putting in the same hard graft.When it comes to acting, equal pay is more complex.Marlon Brando was paid £2.6million in 1978 to appear as Superman’s dad. He worked for 12 days, refused to learn his lines and was on screen for less than ten minutes.It was thought his presence would put bums on seats, but it must have been hard to justify to the rest of the cast.Then there was Elizabeth Taylor, who cashed a cheque for a million dollars to appear as Cleopatra in 1963. Co-star Richard Burton was paid buttons in comparison.Stars are worth as much money as their agents can grab and it depends on their box-office appeal. It’s the same when it comes to certain West End shows or pantos.Talented singers and dancers have to watch half-witted reality stars being parachuted into lead roles and paid fortunes to shift tickets.So while I understand why Eleanor is a bit miffed, I don’t think she had a leg to stand on.But at least it has got people talking about equal pay and highlighting injustices.And if she is the undisputed star in her next role and getting most of the screen time, then she absolutely should get a bigger pay packet.MEGHAN MARKLE went from elegant, alluring, ultra-modern bride to a frumpy wife in less than 72 hours.Her gown was perfect, but this outfit she wore to a party for Prince Charles after her big day looked like one of Princess Anne’s recycled horrors.I’m not sure if it was because Meghan is now a duchess she felt she had to conform to a safe and stuffy look, but it really didn’t work.There’s obviously a lot more to the newest royal than being a fashion plate. She’s bright as well as beautiful and has always had impeccable style.It’s easy to dismiss fashion as being trivial and shallow, but what you wear makes a statement, especially if you are globally renowned.Meghan’s outfit for her father-in-law’s birthday bash at Buckingham Palace screamed that she had been assimilated into the royal “Firm” and was going to be a good girl.We just expected more from the feisty 36-year-old. I hope it was just an unfortunate blip.WOODY ALLEN’S life reads like one of those particularly dark and warped indie movies.He married one adopted daughter and still stands accused of sexually abusing another.He has been disowned by his biological son, the campaigning journalist Ronan Farrow, who helped expose the Harvey Weinstein scandal, over the alleged abuse of Ronan’s sister, Dylan, when she was just seven.Allen, who is now 82, remains lauded by Hollywood luvvies and besotted film buffs who think of him as a cinematic genius, although those who believe Dylan would describe him as a “dirty old man”.He was in a relation- ship with actress Mia Farrow, but their unconventional family fractured after Mia discovered he had been having a sexual relationship with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi, who he went on to marry.JEFF GOLDBLUM is one of the coolest guys on the planet.He’s quirky, eccentric and paddles his own canoe.There aren’t enough endearing characters like him on the planet, and he’s one of the best things about Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the newest movie in lucrative franchise. Jeff reprises his role as Dr Ian Malcolm, who first appeared in the original movie 25 years ago. Dr Malcolm doesn’t think human beings should mess around with nature and is consistently proven right.Jeff shares many of those views and behind that arm-waving, kooky exterior is a man of fierce intelligence and laser-sharp insight.If we were ever to be stupid enough to clone dinosaurs, he’s the man you would want in charge of sorting the whole mess out.Maybe Trump could get him to fix North Korea before Jeff starts on peace in the Middle East.Now the story has hit the headlines again with another of Mia’s brood of adopted children breaking their silence to support Allen.Moses Farrow, 40, wrote a blog this week about the man he calls Dad stating that Allen is completely innocent of any charges of abuse, which inevitably means he thinks his sister Dylan is a liar.No charges have ever been brought against Allen, but the family is broken and poor Dylan has been badly damaged by the alleged abuse claims that have haunted her for 25 years.There are no winners in this sad situation, apart from Allen himself.Actors still queue up for parts in his films and he continues to live his life as a privileged New Yorker.The breath of scandal has barely touched him, but his son is a tenacious investigative journalist and if there ever is a case to answer, it will one day be father against son, brother against sister and mother against father – and will inevitably be turned into a movie.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And for good.The free-trading “global Britain” Mrs May has repeatedly made central to her vision of our future will be dead.Her entire Department for International Trade will be redundant.Incredibly, we would be inviting Brussels to run the trade policy of the world’s fifth biggest economy forever — even after we have supposedly “left” the EU.And we would have NO say in it.This is not the minor detail Remainers want you to believe. It is a giant, decisive leap towards the destruction of Brexit and 17million referendum votes.It would be a mortal blow to the Prime Minister. How could she survive it?Tory rebels must realise this. But even wrecking their PM, Government and party, jeopardising national stability and potentially handing power to Corbyn’s Marxist lunatics fails to deter them.Mrs May must leave them in no doubt about the monstrous risk they are taking.Then, for the first time, she must turn that aggression on Brussels.The Sun is heartily sick of the EU’s destructive belligerence and playground bullying, sick of it “teaching Britain a lesson”, sick of our timid, cowed Government cravenly turning the other cheek.We’ve had two years of it.

Like it denies poisoning the Skripals, backing Assad’s chemical weapons massacres and meddling in other countries’ ­elections. But the world must act.Many countries have sent Putin’s spies home.

The knife is not the crime. Children seldom randomly pick up knives and decide to stab people. In my experience it often starts when the child is young.This spate of killings will pass but for now it affords the attention and opportunity to reflect.Currently, the debate is cyclical and futile. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says it’s not his fault, he needs more police. The police say we need more of them. The Government says you’ve had more police but it didn’t make a difference. Meanwhile, children are dying on the streets.The search for solutions must stretch beyond the police. Aside from outrage, there needs to be a focus on the causes, as well as the symptoms, of these crimes.This shouldn’t detract from taking knives away from those carrying them, but we can’t ignore the fact that replacing a blade is as simple as going to the kitchen drawer.Those of us who are more able to look at the world through the eyes of young people who carry knives for protection and status get closer to how they think.What we are witnessing is a sophisticated type of group mind. Some of our boys are so mentally zoned into a culture of violence. All of my youths know, directly, someone murdered, or at least seriously injured, on our streets. Some have been involved.How did we get to this place? Slowly. As the influence of parents, pastors and school principals has waned, all our young people speak of a distinct feeling of powerlessness.The tried and traditional levers and sanctions affecting the development of children are not functioning effectively. For too many, the family bond is damaged and so ruptured we overlook its devastating effects. My young people need something to fight, something to believe in. Like everyone else, they want to be someone, and sometimes that means fighting each other.It is a sad day when, for some, employment prospects are more plentiful with local dealers selling weed and crack than the only other job on offer at the local barber’s.Some of the young people I work with speak about the role of their family’s socio-economic status in their life choices. If they’re lucky, they see their parents locked into dead-end, minimum-wage jobs with no security or satisfaction. Knives, they conclude, are a type of urban qualification. As one put it: “Everyone wants to be someone, this is my way.”Digging deeper, I learned that 85 per cent of my students had never patronised a black-owned business in the past five years, aside from a barber shop. Too many of them carry the assumption that blacks are inferior. “This is how it is,” Adamu told me. “Our business is on the road, we are designed for the hustle.”I began this work with an agenda to keep black boys from being arrested in their droves.Sadly, a lot of our kids have ended up in prison, but they started the three-lap race of life two laps behind. For some, it is almost impossible to work through all the scars.For many of our children, entrance to crime and urban violence is connected to a sense of wanting to be accepted and acceptable — violence is currency.Their hope is that they survive long enough to one day grow out of it. The desire to belong is so real that any community, including gangs, will do.The more law enforcement is used, the more of a challenge it becomes. It almost acts as encouragement because it is something else to beat.Drugs are also a way of life. For some it’s about using, for others it’s selling. It’s simply a way to earn money. A visit to our social housing estates will reveal high levels of organisation. Like any business, you have distribution points, a clear marketing strategy and, most of all, plans to deal with the opposition.I also see the age of involvement getting younger and they don’t care if they live or die. In that sense they are like suicide bombers.Recently I was involved in the rehabilitation of two nine-year-old boys. One was tasked with moving weapons from location to location and the other given addresses for drug drops. He would deliver the packages during school lunch breaks in exchange for McDonald’s, KFC and clothes.Children like these do not grow up seeing themselves as having a future in business or leadership. They are crying out for genuine role models. When our young men find more employment opportunities from businessmen than “road men”, real change will begin.Until that time, we need to love these children back to sanity. They are simply not able to make the rational choices our education and social systems demand.We experience a ruling class committed to maintaining the status quo. Talk about social mobility is just air. Our children are left with the crumbs that fall from the master’s table.The Government is afraid of the mob — but in some areas there is little less than anarchy breaking out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government has no credible policy and the whole world knows it.“Whitehall’s real preparations are for the continuation of EU law and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.“The State has made no preparations to leave and plans to make no preparations to leave — even after leaving.”Barring a last-minute change of tune, Mrs May is walking into an ambush which will sour relations with Brussels and condemn Britain to a generation of rancorous civil discord.A botched deal will be dressed up in Brussels newspeak as a triumph for all sides.In fact it will almost certainly betray 17.4million British people who explicitly voted OUT in the biggest democratic mandate ever seen in this country.Voters who hoped for clear and unequivocal freedom from EU laws and regulations are unlikely to stay silent for long.They expected Brexit ministers to carve out a prosperous and independent future.Instead, they have watched defeated Remainers mount a ruthless and successful counter-attack.From a position of strength as a major trading nation, Britain has surrendered on all fronts, caved in to Brussels bullies — and handed over a £39BILLION ransom for the privilege.We are likely to remain bound by a version of the EU customs union, the single market and the European Court of Justice for years to come. Meanwhile, mass immigration runs out of control.Perhaps to his own amazement, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has succeeded in his aim to make Britain worse off outside.We will not be allowed to flourish as a free-trading sovereign state.Nobody can be more vividly aware of this than Mrs May as she prepares for her looming summit.Yet she has only herself to blame, starting with the catastrophic snap election which destroyed her Commons majority.She needlessly coughed up that £39billion with nothing in return from Brussels and allowed herself to be derailed by phantom threats of IRA violence if the UK establishes any sort of border with Ireland.The sad truth is that Mrs May is not up to the job as Prime Minister at a momentous point in our history.In an age when words really count, we are lumbered with an ultra-cautious leader who cannot think on her feet or speak without notes.At a time when we should all be doing our best to make Brexit work, we have a Prime Minister who would much prefer to Remain.For the moment, Leavers such as Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg are pledging their loyalty.But a bad deal would provoke die-hard Tories into the only honourable action they feel they can take — and put her premiership on the line.They already have the votes needed to trigger a leadership contest.They will not support key Commons votes to dilute Brexit, risking Government defeat by an unholy alliance of Labour opportunists, Lib Dem and SNP wreckers and Tory Remainers.A disastrous combination of weak leadership, cack-handed communication and dismal diplomacy has plunged Britain into a needless constitutional crisis.It says something about Mrs May’s position as leader that her strongest card is the prospect of yet another general election — the third in three years.And the nightmare of political throwback Jeremy Corbyn storming the barricades and leading his Marxist extremists to power.[boxout featured-image=6392734]AS PM, Tony Blair insisted 50 per cent of school leavers must go to university.The result was grade inflation across the board and “Ology” graduates struggling to find a decent job.Now his sensible son Euan, 34, is arguing for tailor-made apprenticeships, giving kids a chance to earn while they learn.His views coincide with new Tory policy – T-levels, technical and trade qualifications which fit pupils to the work they want.They can range from plumbers and computer wizards to City bankers.Many will be driving their own car and buying a home by the time pals leave university with mountains of debt.It is the way forward in skill-hungry Britain.[/boxout] Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the past few months alone, two of the stores in the survey, Toys R Us and Maplin, have gone into administration.Others such as Mothercare and Laura Ashley have issued profit warnings, New Look has requested rent cuts, Debenhams is slashing staff numbers and announced an 85% drop in profits, while Carpetright has announced the closure of around a quarter of its stores.Some Laura Ashley, Mothercare and Debenhams customers told Which? that although these stores offered a good range and good quality items, they thought value for money was poor unless it was during the sales.In contrast, shoppers praised the cheap and cheerful nature of New Look stores but one shopper told Which? the “stores could be a bit tidier”.WH Smith was also attacked on social media, with one writing: Its been an awful, shamelessly overpriced shop for years.Another commented: Its a chocolate shop pretending to be a stationary shop. They are just terrible.Ben Clissitt, Which?

Because it could not.No amount of, Be careful - we could still walk out, you know, sabre-rattling makes the slightest odds when the other side knows that the day after doing so, we would be back pleading for continuity and for the ongoing delivery of, and access to, functions the British state has no capability to provide.And Dom Cummings, who ran the Vote Leave campaign, wrote last week: Downing Street, the Treasury, the Cabinet Office and the Cabinet have made no such preparations and there is no intention of starting.Chancellor Philip Hammond has come under fire for failing to provide enough funding for a no deal scenario.Last year, he set aside £3billion to fund Britains preparation for leaving the EU.The Sun revealed last week that ministers are making plans to turn 13 miles of the M20 into a lorry park if customs checks are imposed at Dover.A Downing Street spokesman said: The Prime Minister is committed to getting the best possible Brexit deal, one that works for the UK and the EU.The Government is committing extensive resources as part of our preparations for leaving the EU - whether in the event of a deal or not, and at the autumn Budget the chancellor allocated £3billion specifically for our exit preparations.The Foreign Secretary - who has just returned from a trip to South America - said quitting the EU will allow us to build stronger links with other countries.And he said our EU membership had weakened ties with countries such as Argentina, Chile and Peru.Boris wrote in the Daily : Now is our moment not to be less European - we can do a great free trade deal with the EU that will benefit both sides - but to be truly global again.Now is the time to create deals with these dynamic countries.He added: For Latin America and for Britain there are realms of gold on either side of the Atlantic.

The same was seen in our case.Though the patient reported accidental insertion of the shower head and denied voluntary insertion, there is a high suspicion of voluntary insertion for auto-erotic purpose.It is not the first time a foreign object has had to be removed from a rectum.In fact, its surprisingly common.A large variety of objects have been reported, including bottles, cans, glass bulbs, stones, small rods, fruits and vegetables, vibrators, dildos and toys, Dr Kumar added.Insertion of objects for auto-erotic purposes is the most common cause of rectal foreign bodies.Other common causes include accidents and assaults. The presentation is often delayed, and history is often improper.Two-thirds of the patients are males in their 30s or 40s, who use such objects for auto-erotic purposes.Last year a man perforated his bowel after he lost control of a 30in bendy sex toy after a boozy night.The 53-year-old man presented to A\u0026ampE complained of severe lower abdomen pain and admitted he had inserted a non-battery operated sex toy into his rectum.Doctors noted that the sex toy had been inserted into the rectum when the man was under heavy alcohol influence which led to a loss of control."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000409368888.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"facebook marketplace man takes ford fiesta without paying","story":"George Wood, 21, had advertised his silver Ford Fiesta on Facebook Marketplace when he handed over the keys to a “toothless” man - who promised to pay for it later.But George was left around £300 out of pocket when the buyer failed to transfer the money into his bank account.When the money failed to materialise he sent a flurry of texts to the culprit who responded: “You won’t be getting your money but you will be getting a punch in the mouth”.After Kent Police said there was nothing he could do, because he had willingly handed over the keys, George from Ashford, Kent posted an appeal on Facebook to try to find his motor.The alleged thief then sent George a picture of his 16-year-old car at a scrap yard - being crushed by a giant metal claw.George said: I was a bit of an idiot. He came to buy it, he said he had to transfer half and he never did.

Only half? Sounds optimistic to me.But leading the band which once epitomised sex and drugs and rock ’n’ roll — and the debauched history of the Stones is etched deeply into the corrugated faces of Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood — is the man who can teach us all we need to know about staying fit.Unlike Mick, we don’t have to take up yoga, ballet and kickboxing — but like him, we do have to think about getting our blood pumping every day of our lives.And unlike Jagger, we do not have to start every day with a smoothie — but we do have to think more about what we are putting into our bodies.Few of us could ever hope to follow Jagger’s punishing fitness regime, working out for hours most days of the week under the watchful eye of personal trainer Torje Eike.We don’t have the time, money or indeed fitness levels to keep up with this great-grandfather.But by having Mick Jagger as a role model, every one of us can be healthier than we are — slimmer, fitter and ready to rock ’n’ roll.The key to Jagger’s fitness is that everything counts.If you put good food into your body or if you eat rubbish.If you make regular demands on your body or just reach for the TV remote.Jagger gets mocked for his action-packed love life (at 73, he had a son with 29-year-old ballerina Melanie Hamrick) and for his laughter lines — nothing is that funny, Mick!But if you saw Jagger bouncing about like a 19-year-old this week, then you could not help but take him seriously.And want a slice of whatever he is having.So the next time the nation has a panic attack about how fat we are becoming, we need to get Jagger on the case.For — at the risk of being impolite — when did you ever see Jamie Oliver looking even remotely slim?But Mick Jagger is still dancing like it is 1969.And you never see a fat Rolling Stone. IT was such a glorious day in Windsor last Saturday that you would think even the hardest of hearts would soften at the sight of young love framed by pomp, pageantry and that cloudless blue sky.But the moaning anti-monarchy minnies are always with us.“Proof again that GB is an infantilised, escapist nation,” sneered Ugandan-born, Oxford-educated commentator Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, 68.Meanwhile, in Wales, Oxfam apologised if a modest royal wedding display in Oxfam’s Aberystwyth shop – Meghan and Harry face masks and some Union Flag bunting – had “caused upset”.But I was on the Long Walk in Windsor with those cheering crowds last Saturday, and I have never felt such a feeling of national unity.The monarchy exists solely with the blessing of the British people.We can divest ourselves of it at any time – as so many countries have ditched their royal families over the past few centuries.But if you stood among those crowds on the Long Walk – who came from every creed, class, race and religion on the planet – then you would believe that the future of the Royal Family is assured for the next 100 years.Anyone dreaming of a republican paradise should not hold their breath.Jada will be an inspiration to anyone suffering from the condition.Because with or without her hair, Jada still looks beautiful.BUCK-TOOTHED Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho is best remembered for two great performances – lobbing David Seaman’s ponytail in the 2002 World Cup and scoring eight times in one night with dancer Lisa Collins.One of these performances earned him the nickname “Pneumatic Drill”. And it wasn’t lobbing David Seaman.You might think that at 38, Ronaldinho’s pneumatic drill was getting a bit rusty, but in August he is to “wed” both his girlfriends, Beatriz Souza and Priscilla Coelho, in a joint ceremony.More three-in-one oil, darling?We are told that Britain should rely on the “good faith” from Brussels.What good faith?When did Brussels ever show anything but contempt, disdain and disrespect towards this country after we voted to leave?The EU’s attempt to shut Britain out of the Galileo satellite project – which we helped to fund – is just the latest insult.If May wants to give Brussels £39billion without a trade deal nailed down, then she should resign today.And make way for someone who will finally stand up for this country.THE Labour Party has suspended local party representative Ian McKenzie for saying that Islamic State would behead Labour’s Emily Thornberry rather than using her as a sex slave.McKenzie, chairman of the Lewisham East constituency, does not deny his crass comments, although some suggest they are being used by his opponents on Labour’s hard Left to discredit him.It sounds like he is doing a good job of discrediting himself.HARRY KANE will be England’s youngest ever World Cup captain – younger even than Bobby Moore.Kane will do a fine job but Bobby Moore beat testicular cancer in his early twenties and then lifted the World Cup at 25.And for any England captain, that will always be a hard act to follow.HOW stark-raving mad that TV historian Dan Snow feels he has to lie to his daughters that women flew Spitfires in World War Two so they feel free to “follow their dreams”.“My daughter was walking down rows and rows and rows of these Spitfire racers and she was going, ‘Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy’,” says Snow.So to protect his six-year-old daughter from what he calls “the grim realities of pre-20th century gender relations”, Snow told her that some women also flew Spitfires in combat.And when I read of Snow’s bizarre lie, I thought of Violette Szabo, who was parachuted twice into Nazi-occupied Europe during World War Two to aid the French Resistance.On her second mission she was captured, tortured by the Gestapo and executed at Ravensbruck concentration camp in 1945.She was 23.Dan Snow has apparently never heard of Violette Szabo – because if he had, then he could surely have told his daughters about her.But many readers will know her incredible story from the film Carve Her Name With Pride.Violette was the working-class daughter of a French mother and a British father.She fell in love with a French Foreign Legion soldier of Hungarian descent called Etienne Szabo, who was killed in 1942 at El Alamein.Violette, who spoke fluent French, trained as a special-operations field agent to fight the Nazis.The torments she suffered before her death are beyond our imagination and her courage is at least the equal of any man who fought in World War Two – and I speak as the proud son of a Royal Naval Commando who won the Distinguished Service Medal.Educate yourself about Violette Szabo, Mr Snow.Then tell your daughters about her.WE all grew up as Star Wars fans but now it feels like there is always a new movie or spin-off coming out.The Last Jedi was only last year and this week sees the release of Han Solo’s back story, Solo. Talk about flogging a dead Wookiee.When Katy Perry is taking to the stage in a C-3PO mini-dress, the exploitation of the Star Wars franchise has possibly gone too far.We’re doomed, Katy.

We’ve teamed up with the cycling experts at Halfords to select four great suggestions of cycle routes to visit. And we’ve listed some all-important things you may want to consider to ensure you’re completely prepared. \u2028Remember, a bike ride can be five minutes or five hours – the main thing is getting out in the fresh air with your loved ones. How to check your bikes are ready  If you’re heading off on a family trip then it’s important to make sure that everyone’s bike is in good condition. A few simple checks before you set out could save you a lot of worry later on. Make sure your bike’s tyres are inflated to the correct pressure (there’s a helpful guide here ), and remember that on mountain bikes there are different tyre pressures for on-road and off-road. If you have questions, then it\u0027s also worth checking Halfords’ massive selection of cycling help and advice online. Ideally, you’ll check the tyres around a week before you go, and re-check before you leave to see if they have lost any pressure during that time. If they do, you may have a puncture that you can repair. Alternatively, Halfords will do any bike maintenance you need in-store and has service and repair plans that offer yearly checks.  You should also make sure that your chain is rust-free, as well as checking that all your gears work and the levers operate them smoothly. Often a simple adjustment is all that’s needed, but if you don’t feel confident then Halfords has a FREE bike check to make sure you’re in good shape, and offers a range of services to ensure that your bike is in tip-top condition. Halfords experts will conduct checks on your gears, brakes, tyres and frame to make sure you’re good to go. Not only will you be taking advantage of their expert knowledge, you’ll also be freeing up more time to spend enjoying yourself. Get the right rack  If you\u0027re planning to drive somewhere with your family\u0027s bikes then you need to choose a rack for your car that suits your needs. The Thule 591 Bike Carrier allows you to mount one bike on the roof of your car, keeping it nice and safe en route to your cycling break. You can actually fit up to four to your car – so it’s a good thing that right now when you buy one, you can get another half price, with free fitting. Alternatively, consider a rear-mounted rack, like the Thule 9403 Bike Carrier , which holds up to three cycles. Right now there’s 20 per cent off a range of bike racks at Halfords, and its experts will fit them for you, meaning you can focus on your next trip. So, where to cycle?\u2028\u2028 Richmond Park, London  The Tamsin Trail in Richmond Park has quiet and car-free tracks that offer a cycle of a little more than seven miles. You can get there by train – although check the bike capacity with the relevant operator – or by car. Because the trails don\u0027t feature a lot of motor traffic it\u0027s ideal if you\u0027re just starting out or have kids.  It\u0027s only just outside London – you can see St Paul\u0027s through a gap in the trees at King Henry\u0027s Mound – but it feels like the proper countryside. Some with smaller children might be feeling a bit left out here, but don’t worry because Halfords has the Hamax Kiss Rear Child Bike Seat at half price in time for the bank holiday weekend.  Little kids adore being taken around on the back of your bike, and it will give you beefier leg muscles too! If you\u0027ve got a couple of smaller children then you might also want to consider the Halfords Double Buggy trailer, which is a two-seater trailer for your little ones (older than 12 months) that allows you to get out and about, and give them a load of fun at the same time. Ae Valley, Scotland  Located near Dumfries, the Ae Valley Route is classified as Green by the Scottish Forestry Commission, which makes it suitable for families (there are more challenging routes nearby too). It\u0027s about 5.6 miles with stunning views and exciting, single track forest roads. As it\u0027s well-suited to families, consider one of Halfords’ amazing kids bikes. The Apollo Gridlok is ideal for 8-11 year-olds and is currently has 20 per cent off. So too is the Carrera Star bike, aimed at smaller children aged 4-6. (Discount applies to 14” Carrera Star only.)  Remember, you can always pop in to store with you little ones to have them try out bikes, and Halfords experts are on-hand to help you pick the right model. They’ll check the bike is the right size and even build it for you, free of charge. Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire  A 14 mile marked circuit means that this won\u0027t suit very young cyclists, but may well appeal to families with a bit more experience. Of course you don\u0027t have to ride the whole route and circuit isn\u0027t too challenging even for families. The route is signposted too, just start at the Cannop Cycle Centre.  An ideal route for families who have developed a love of cycling together, perhaps with older kids. Consider the Carrera Kraken mountain bike for this trip, especially if your existing bike is looking a little sorry for itself. If you pop in store now you\u0027ll also find this brilliant bike is now only \u0026pound360, (down from \u0026pound450, thanks to Halfords’ 20 per cent offer on a range of bikes). Stanhope \u0026amp Tyne Railway Railway path, Sunderland  This route is easy to break into much smaller sections, and is made up of paths that follow the old railway route closed in 1985. There is no traffic to worry about, the surfaces are largely good quality gravel or tarmac and of course it\u0027s easy to access from Sunderland\u0027s public transport. This route is ideally suited for those who want to break up a cycling tour over a few days. The flat, mostly smooth paths mean that if you\u0027re not a mountain biker then you\u0027ll be fine.  And for those looking for a new bike, the Pendleton Somerby hybrid bike offers both style and practicality in spades.

David Olusoga said repatriating the objects help our relationship with the Commonwealth after Brexit .  Mr Olusoga, who came to the UK from Nigeria as a child, said he believed the Benin Bronzes should be given back to the country of his heritage after they were seized in ‘violent raids’ in the late 19th century. The historian, who presents the BBC Civilisations series, has called for the Elgin Marbles, one of the most high profile and contentious cases, should be returned to Greece.  He told the audience at the Hay literary festival that a friend of his had come up with a solution: “He said we should have a special version of Supermarket Sweep where every country is given a huge shopping trolley and two minutes in the British Museum. Maybe he’s right, maybe that’s the way forward.” He said there were around 4,000 objects taken from the Nigerian palace that were national treasures including the Benin bronzes.  “I think it’s a very, very clear case of appropriation and theft,” he said. “They were taken in 1897 during the raid on the Palace of Benin. The palace was destroyed they were taken and then sold to pay for the cost of the military adventure. Everyone was open about this – steal this stuff, send it to pay for the cost of the bullets. It’s just such a stark case of theft.” "},{"url":null,"title":"eight job osborne former chancellor","story":"NewsEight job Osborne!

But 60 years on those once-young men who were ordered to watch the test firing of Britain\u0027s deadliest weapon are victims of a different horror: official denial. At war pension hearings, Supreme Court appeals and over petitions and pleas, successive British governments have told our nuclear test veterans that what they did was nothing special. They were not irradiated, they cannot prove it, they have no claim.  There is evidence aplenty of what happened to those men. A University of Dundee study found a third of the veterans died before 1999, most in their 50s and from the sort of cancers that, were they at an American bomb test, would have got them a war pension.    To show your support for an official medal for the nuclear veterans by signing the petition - CLICK HERE .    Their wives report 3 times the normal rate of miscarriages. Their children have 10 times the normal amount of birth defects - such as missing and extra teeth, spine and skull deformities, heart and eye problems. Another study found double the rate of blood cancers that the government had admitted another found higher rates of leukaemia, Down\u0027s syndrome and infant mortality.  And we know the Grapple Y blast alone, on April 28, 1958, was 100 times more powerful than the bombs which levelled Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Imagine how it feels to be that veteran, and told that your family\u0027s suffering is still not proof.  The British government has always insisted on a scientific link between the radiation and the veterans\u0027 claimed health issues. That sounds reasonable, until you realise that the science which could establish the truth simply hasn\u0027t been invented yet - and by the time that it is, the veterans will all be long gone.  Of the 22,000 who were sent to Maralinga in Australia, Malden Island and Christmas Island in the south Pacific, and to US tests in Nevada, just 1,500 are still alive. A small and shrinking cohort who are still fighting a long-forgotten war.  But they have 155,000 descendants. You might even be one without knowing it, if there are estrangements or remarriages within your family. And scientists do agree on something - that radiation causes genetic mutation, that these mutations can last for 20 generations or 500 years, and that there is no way of knowing who will be affected.   To show your support for an official medal for the nuclear veterans by signing the petition - CLICK HERE .   Radiation causes random changes in the DNA. It may be pancreatic cancer, a thyroid dysfunction, or your sperm is rendered useless. It could be your children have blue eyes rather than green. A 2007 study on New Zealand veterans at British bomb tests found they had the same rate of genetic damage as survivors of the Chernobyl blast. The UK government would have you believe this is coincidence.  We need only common sense to realise that what links these men and their families to those of Chernobyl is the release of deadly, damaging material. Perhaps they were not all irradiated - perhaps they were harmed by the DDT sprayed over the island most days, or the toxic heavy metals that rain out of nuclear explosions like beryllium, or something else that was unique to the nuclear tests we conducted on two Pacific islands and two separate continents. The British government claims the bombs were safe. If that was so, why did we build a massive military base in the middle of the South Pacific in order to explode them?   To show your support for an official medal for the nuclear veterans by signing the petition - CLICK HERE .   If that was so, why didn\u0027t we save a lot of time and expense and test those bombs in Southampton? And if that was so, of what use could non-harmful, totally safe bombs possibly be to our military?  The answer, of course, is that it wasn\u0027t safe. We wouldn\u0027t do it today. And if we ever were to fire another nuclear weapon, you can be damned sure that we wouldn\u0027t do it with 22,000 of our own servicemen stood underneath it dressed in nothing but cotton shorts.   They did not know the risks. Many were on National Service with no choice about being there. The risks they took are now perfectly clear.  On Christmas Island a few weeks ago four of the veterans returned to dedicate a new memorial built by the impoverished islanders. They were feted by local politicians, given all respect, and invited to parade the standard of the British Nuclear Test Veterans\u0027 Association.  That is more honour than they have ever received in their own country. Here, they are told to apply for a war pension, and that to get one they\u0027ll need proof of their radiation dose, when such proof is either held by the government, never existed, or has long since been lost. So 90% of all their pension applications are rejected.  Here, \u0026pound17m of taxpayer\u0027s money has been spent fighting court claims for compensation. Here, the government admits irradiating civilians but not service personnel. Here, if they want a medal they have to buy an unofficial, unrecognised one - and it\u0027s \u0026pound45.

Yvonne Mason, from Atlanta, said the letter was so poorly written it would have barely scrapped a pass in her class. “If it had been written in middle school, I’d give it a C or C-plus. If it had been written in high school, I’d give it a D,” Ms Mason told South Carolina’s Greenville News. I have never, ever, received a letter with this many silly mistakes, she said.  The numerous errors included 11 examples of incorrect capitalisation of words such as “president” and “state”. Ms Mason, who had written to the Donald Trump about the Valentine\u0027s Day school shooting in Florisa which left 17 dead, was stylistically appalling. This included 11 examples of incorrect capitalisation of words such as “president” and “state”. Although she admitted it was probably written by a member of staff rather than the president, Ms Mason said she was surprised that it was so poorly written. “When you get letters from the highest level of government, you expect them to be at least mechanically correct,” she said. So she decided to dig out her favourite purple pen, as red is considered too harsh by some teachers in the US, make some corrections and return the letter. But Ms Mason wasn\u0027t just disappointed by the calibre of the writing but also the letter\u0027s content.  She said Mr Trump had completely failed to address her concerns. In the letter she sent the former teacher urged Mr Trump to individually meet with the families who lost loved ones at the Stoneman Douglas High School massacre.

Former Energy Minister Greg Barker, now a peer, is raking in tens of thousands as chairman of En+ Group. MPs last night called our revelation “deeply troubling” and urged the Tories to act. The Foreign Affairs Select Committee last week raised concerns about energy giant En+, which is “controlled by billionaire and Kremlin associate Oleg Deripaska”. Their report on Russian “dirty money” in the UK came just weeks after Donald Trump slapped sanctions on En+ and Mr Deripaska – a close ally of President Putin. The Mirror can disclose that Lord Barker, who quit as MP for Bexhill and Battle in 2015, agreed to become chairman of En+ in October.  MPs said its flotation on the London Stock Exchange a month later was an example of “contradictions inherent in UK government policy towards Russia”. The Mirror revealed last week that former Tory leader William Hague is a paid advisor to a law firm which “facilitated” En+’s controversial flotation. The FASC last week warned the UK is turning a “blind eye” to Russia’s “dirty money” and putting national security at risk. MPs also said London was being used to hide the “corrupt assets” of President Putin and his cronies.

Logan Johns-Evans was rushed to hospital after his mum Jade Johns found him unresponsive when she went to wake him up for school. She said the youngster had smoked a rolled-up cigarette but he had no idea the synthetic drug Spice was put in it as a joke.  Ms Johns told Wales Online that her son reacted as though a “monster had taken over his body” - and she\u0027s shared shocking photos showing him unconscious in his hospital bed.   The mum, from Wildmill, South Wales, said the drug could not be tested for in her son\u0027s urine or blood, but doctors checked his symptoms and made a clinical decision that he was suffering from the effects of Spice. The drug can cause fast heart rate, vomiting, confusion and violent behaviour, although many users are often pictured slumped over in town or city centres looking like zombies. Ms Johns said she and her family were beside themselves with worry as her son lay unresponsive in a bed at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend.  Ms Johns said: “He woke up at 3am and I thought he was sleepwalking because he was trying to make his way out the door and he was making no sense. “I put him back to bed and at 6.40am I went to wake him up for school and he couldn’t speak or stand so we whisked him to hospital. “He was in resus on high dependency. He was like a zombie. A monster had taken over his body and he had so much strength it was unreal.  “It was scary because he couldn’t speak and there was nothing in him. There was no response to his eyes or the light in his pupils, the only way you could describe it was like a zombie because nothing was making sense. “In hospital he became angry and he had so much strength but the doctors said he didn’t know what was going on. It wasn’t an 11-year-old child inside that body. “My daughter told me he had been smoking and someone came forward to say someone had put Spice in his rolly as a joke.” Around 33 hours after arriving at hospital, Logan came around and became his normal self but he had no memory of what had happened and believed he had only just arrived at hospital.

As boy soldiers in 1958, thousands of this country’s fittest young men were ordered to a tropical paradise to take part in the biggest military operation since D-Day. Today they have been honoured by the impoverished islanders who still live in the testing grounds – while in the UK successive governments continue to obstruct calls for official recognition. Ron Watson, 79, organised the trip to remind the British they are still fighting. He said: “A medal doesn’t take away the problems people had when they came home. But it relieves the psychological pressure we have been under for 60 years. “An official medal recognises that we made a sacrifice for our country. When you go to war in Afghanistan you know the risks – but in the nuclear tests we had no idea. Nobody did. We were the guinea pigs.” To show your support for an official medal for the nuclear veterans by signing the petition - CLICK HERE .  Former Royal Engineer Ron was just 19 when he was part of Operation Grapple, the crucial campaign to build a hydrogen bomb. It was held on a coral island 2,000 miles south of Hawaii, where a total of 22,000 servicemen were ordered to build the infrastructure for, and bear witness to, dozens of nuclear tests. Ron, like all the others, wore little but shorts and boots as they were ordered to muster with their backs to the beach, squat down and cover their eyes. “There was a flash so strong you could see the bones in your fingers like an X-ray,” said Ron, from Warboys, Cambs. “Then a terrific heatwave like an electric heater being waved across your bare back, a crack and a rumble. Fellers who stood up too soon were knocked to the ground by it all. When we were told to stand and look, there was a great ball of fire in the sky. Afterwards we just got on with the day job.” Ron lost all his teeth within two years of returning home. He and his daughter have both had tumours removed their thyroids – the organ where radiation is known to accumulate. And his wife suffered two later-term miscarriages, which led to divorce. Research has shown a third of the test vets were dead before 1999, many in their 50s from radiogenic cancers. A 2007 study found their wives report three times the normal number of miscarriages. They have an estimated 155,000 descendants, who suffer 10 times the usual amount of birth defects.   Now four of the Cold War heroes have made a pilgrimage to the testing grounds at Christmas Island – since renamed Kirimati - to mark the 60th anniversary. Along with Ron were former RAF technician Leslie Hawkins, 81, from Horley, Surrey, and another two ex-Royal Engineers Robert McCann, 79, from Romsey, Hants, and Ray Carbery, 80, from the Isle of Man. Ray, who has constant bowel problems and a severely autistic son, said: “What people don’t realise is they didn’t send the weedy guys. They gave us all medicals first, we were the healthiest they had. “The surprise isn’t that some of us aren’t so bad, it’s that so many healthy men aren’t here any more. Whatever happened on Christmas Island killed the fittest lads in the armed forces. Out of the 12 in my unit, half died of blood cancer.” The veterans took with them toys and books for the schoolchildren, as well as blood pressure monitors, surgical gloves and stethoscopes for the hospital, all paid for from their own pensions. They were feted by the island’s political leaders, shown demonstrations of local dancing, and taken on a tour to the south of the island to find the wreckage left behind by the British: rusting metal huts, overgrown bunkers, and concrete plinths to which bomb balloons were tethered.  And at a special commemoration service, they were invited to dedicate a new memorial built by the islanders. Speeches were exchanged and the four old soldiers bore the standard of the British Nuclear Test Veterans’ Association Ron said: “It’s ironic that that the o.nly people prepared to recognise what we did are on the other side of the world. Our own government doesn’t have the decency to do the same.” In the UK no nuclear test veteran has ever been invited to meet a Prime Minister. Around 90% of those who seek war pensions are refused, and despite the MoD’s scant records are required to provide proof of their radiation dose. And more than \u0026pound17m has been spent fighting successive court claims and war pension appeals. Leslie has made three return trips to Christmas Island but says this will be his last. He said: “We’re probably the last ones who’ll ever make that journey, so it was important to go. “It would be nice to have a medal rather than have it swept under the carpet. There’s not many of us left so it wouldn’t cost much.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kevin maguire tories defenceless military","story":"NewsopinionKevin Maguire: Tories defenceless on military pay cutWeakening trade unions and stripping employment protection under the cover of cutting red tape when the gig economy’s falsely ­self-employed cabbies and couriers suffer as much or more as the employed, is what drives these Tories as it did the old\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByKevin MaguireAssociate editor22:06, 27 MAY 2018NewsopinionZero hours contracts have become an increasing curse (Image: Getty)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOffhand Tory Caroline Dinenage’s contemptuous dismissal of desperately low-paid local women being cheated of \u0026pound500 a year tells a bigger national scandal. The brazen Gosport MP and junior Health Minister is proving an enemy rather than an ally as cooks and cleaners at military bases on \u0026shyPortsmouth Harbour fight a contractor’s dirty tricks. This column last October revealed the plucky Fort Blockhouse group’s brave if unequal fight against ESS, part of Compass Group with a Fat Cat \u0026pound5.8m boss, after the corporate bloodsuckers unilaterally decided to stop paying them for two weeks of the year. I regret to report deadbeat Dinenage fobbed off the women when they asked for help, doing the bare minimum as far as I can see in writing to junior Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood then forwarding his worthless reply to a union official without the courtesy of a covering letter. Acknowledging “strength of feeling”, Ellwood added offence to \u0026pound500 injury – two weeks’ pay – by hiding behind MoD contracts, deals granting bad employers green lights to short-change loyal staff. Unite regional officer Bob Middleton’s judgement that the Tory pair “washed their hands” of indefensible abuse is bang on the money.  Gosport is a small piece of a large jigsaw as exploitation at work spreads rapidly and proliferating zero hours contracts become an increasing curse. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady says she’s met Germany’s powerhouse Angela Merkel more often in the last two years than she has Theresa May. A Tory PM who sees CBI business chiefs monthly, but grants a sole audience to the champion of six million workers, betrays the anti-grafter mentality of Conservativism. May, Dinenage, Ellwood and too many of their Tory colleagues instinctively identify with the boss not the bossed, the exploiter not the exploited. Weakening trade unions and stripping employment protection under the cover of cutting red tape when the gig economy’s falsely \u0026shyself-employed cabbies and couriers suffer as much or more as the employed, is what drives these Tories as it did the old.

Thomas and Rebekah Entwistle feel like “hostages” after the structure was put up just 2ft from their front window, blocking the stunning view from their rural home. Music teacher Thomas, 27, and Rebekah, 24 believe the barrier was erected by a farmer who is understood to be involved in a dispute with their estate’s developer over land borders. The pair, who wed in July, moved into the \u0026pound220,000 four-bed property on a Persimmon Homes estate in Blackburn, Lancs, just before Christmas. The fence was in place when they got back from the Dominican Republic last month.  Thomas said: “This was our dream home – now it’s turned into a nightmare. It feels like we are imprisoned in our own house. “The fence is 2ft from our front window – it’s like having the Berlin Wall in front of our home.” “We are being held hostage in a land dispute which is nothing to do with us.  We bought [the house] because of the view, which has now been replaced by a huge wooden fence. Rebekah is always in tears. She is in despair.” He continued: “We’re not even sure we want to live here now. “We keep the curtains closed in the front room, and spend most of our time upstairs. Even if the fence gets taken down, there is no guarantee it won’t come back later.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rogue green heineken ecstasy tablets","story":"News\u0027Rogue GREEN HEINEKEN ecstasy tablets\u0027 blamed for deaths of two people at Mutiny FestivalEXCLUSIVE: Police are investigating after Georgia Jones, 18, and 20-year-old Tommy Cowan both fell ill just 20 minutes apart but sadly died at the music event in Portsmouth, Hants\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAdam Aspinall21:32, 27 MAY 2018Updated23:07, 27 MAY 2018NewsThe Green Heineken ecstasy tablets were being taken at the festival, it\u0027s claimed (Image: Alamy)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRevellers are tonight blaming a batch of rogue ecstasy tablets for the death of two people at a dance music festival this weekend. Police are investigating after Georgia Jones, 18, and 20-year-old Tommy Cowan - aka Tommy Bakeer - were both rushed to hospital after falling ill just 20 minutes apart at Mutiny Festival but sadly died. There are claims tonight that people were taken ill at the festival after taking so-called \u0027Green Heineken\u0027 MDMA tablets. A total of 15 people at the dance music festival were taken to hospital, with one still in critical condition and organisers cancelled the festival today over safety concerns. Just hours after Georgia’s death, her heartbroken mother posted a tribute to her daughter who was “full of life” and urged other drug users to learn from her death. She said her daughter suffered a 45-minute long fit after taking ‘two pills’ at the event in Portsmouth, Hants, where headliners included Dizzee Rascal on Saturday night, and Craig David due to headline on Sunday.  Hampshire Constabulary said the two deaths, which are not being treated as suspicious, were separate incidents before organisers cancelled the rest of the festival this morning. Eyewitness Sam, 20, revealed that people were taking ecstasy tablets nicknamed “Green Heinekens” at the festival and that is what is believed to have caused the emergency. He said: “I saw the girl on the ground being treated by paramedics, it was a horrendous sight, she was in a very bad way. “People said she may have had two pills and if they were the Green Heinekens I can see why as my friend only had one and he was in a right state afterwards. “We had not heard anything about any drug warning, but as soon as people started getting ill it was blamed on the Green Heinekens.”  Mutiny Festival, held at Portsmouth’s King George V playing fields, was expected to attract 30,000 revellers over the course of the two-day event. On Thursday, just two days before the pair died, police said they would be clamping down on drugs at the event. Tributes have since been flooding in to the two young adults. Janine Milburn, Georgia’s mother, said “my little girl was 18 and full of life” and “I just hope this stops at least some of you ending up the same”. Her heartbreaking post read: “As I have now spoken to family members I can now say Georgia died yesterday due to complications after taking two pills at Mutiny. “If nothing else I hope what has happened to her will deter you from taking anything ever.” She continued: “The pills had caused her temperature to rise so high it made her fit for 45 mins. “This then caused her muscle to break down and turn her blood acidic. Her heart was irregular and stopped numerous times and then her lungs filled with blood and fluid and I made the decision to turn everything off. “My little girl was 18 and full of life, I just hope this stops at least some of you from ending up the same.” Georgia’s family did not wish to make a comment when a reporter visited their home in Havant, Hants. The family of Tommy, who goes by Tommy Bakeer and Cowan and is also from Havant, also did not wish to speak.

So far the post has been shared more than 13,000 times, and many people have paid tribute to Georgia. Katy Murray wrote: Just devastating, poor poor family. Such a tragedy heart goes out to them.  Caroline Hayman said: Thinking of family and friends, sad loss. Megan Way wrote: Thoughts go out to family and friends. So sad. And Adele Jenner said: Thinking of the family today and sending all my love and strength, so tragic. There were also claims revellers were taken ill at the festival after taking so-called \u0027Green Heineken\u0027 MDMA tablets. A statement released by organisers of Mutiny said: It is with tremendous sadness that we can confirm that two of our festival family died in hospital overnight. An 18-year-old woman and a 20 year old man were taken to Queen Alexandra Hospital where they sadly died. Following the terrible news from earlier today, the team behind Mutiny Festival are incredibly sad to announce that the Sunday of the festival has been cancelled as a safety precaution. The safety of our amazing customers has always been paramount to us and so to keep everyone safe and in respect to those who have passed, we have taken the decision not to open today. As you can imagine, this decision was not taken lightly and was taken with the support of the local statutory authorities who we continue to work with.

The retailer has found itself in the bottom two for its eighth consecutive year after shoppers panned it for poor customer service and value as well as for the standard of its shops  I find WH Smith very expensive and its stores need updating, one customer told Which?, while another said: I always use the self-service tills because the staff are rude.  A third shopper summed up the retailer\u0027s troubles, branding it hugely inferior to what it was in the past. WH Smith\u0027s poor performance comes only a week after it faced a backlash for overcharging customers for toothpaste and other toiletries in its hospital shops. Which? asked more than 10,000 shoppers about their shopping experience at 100 major retailers.  The customer scores given are based on customers\u0027 experiences of purchasing non-grocery items, their satisfaction levels and the likelihood of recommending each shop. Lush, Savers and Smyths Toys have been named the highest ranking shops a huge leap for three retailers that didn\u0027t even manage last year\u0027s top 10. Customers praised the smells of Lush stores, the prices at discount cosmetics store Savers, and the friendly and cheerful staff at Smyths Toys. Last year\u0027s top two, Toolstation and Richer Sounds - a winner at last week\u0027s Which? Awards - are now in fourth and sixth place, respectively. Despite only dropping by two percentage points, John Lewis, which finished joint third in 2017, falls to 10th place - its worst ranking since our annual survey launched in 2010.  But the department store\u0027s strength as an all-rounder was still evident, as it snatched the top spot in four categories - appliances and electronics, furniture and home, outdoor and sports and wellbeing and beauty. Price proved to be a deciding factor for many consumers - particularly when it came to everyday essentials - pushing stores like Savers up the rankings. Which? saw a similar trend in its recent supermarket survey, which this year saw Aldi overtake Waitrose for the first time in three years, proving that customers are sometimes willing to sacrifice their overall shopping experience if it means getting better value for money. Customers also favoured retailers that offered a sensory experience or specific expertise that is simply not available to them online. Getting top marks in this year\u0027s entertainment category was Waterstones, despite the rise of e-books and the popularity of online retailers like Amazon. People who gave it a high score commented on the stores\u0027 pleasant surroundings as well as the recommendations from friendly staff.

The report, published by Las Vegas news station KLAS, reveals new details of the November 2004 encounter including first hand reports from shocked US Navy personnel.  A video of the strange object, shaped like a Tic Tac mint, emerged last December.  And the report reveals further details of how the UFO was repeatedly spotted during training exercises over a six-day period off the coast of southern California and Mexico.  It was initially seen on radar by the crew of the USS Princeton on November 10, who referred to it in the report as an Anomalous Aerial Vehicle (AAV).  The missile cruiser\u0027s chief fire controlman said it started at an altitude of around 60,000ft - the furthest the ship\u0027s radar could detect - before very rapidly dropping to 50ft. The object then darted away at such speed it was assumed to be a ballistic missile.  It was seen again on November 14, and several F/A-18 Hornet jets returning to the USS Nimitz were sent to try and trace the object. But they were unable to detect the UFO itself, with one of the pilots instead reporting a circular disturbance in the water between 50 and 100 metres in diameter. A Hawkeye surveillance aircraft was also unable to get a lock on to the UFO.  According to the report, it was possible the disturbance was being caused by an AAV but the AAV was \u0027cloaked\u0027 or invisible to the human eye. Another theory was the object had a highly advanced capability to operate undersea completely undetectable by our most advanced sensors. The object was later described by witnesses as an elongated or a \u0027Tic Tac\u0027 shape and said it was around 46ft long, solid white, smooth, with no edges.  It was uniformly coloured with no nacelles, pylons or wings, the report claimed.  F/A-18 pilot David Fravor later revealed the object appeared to notice the US aircraft before zooming away.  He said: It takes off like nothing I\u0027ve ever seen. One minute it\u0027s here, and off, it\u0027s gone.

Fire crews had already been called to the building at Rue Marx-Dormoy in the French capital\u0027s 18th arrondissement with a terrified neighbour on the neighbouring balcony struggling to help the boy back up.

The group\u0027s guru, hippy Georg Berres, claims he only found out it was the former champ\u0027s holiday home when German media turned up on the doorstep. Mr Berres said he wants to give the villa, named Son Coll in the rural north-east town of Arta, a spruce-up. Squatters have already cut weeds and picked up rubbish around the property. But Mr Berres, a 44-year-old carpenter, insisted this week he would leave if police turned up to tell him to go.   As of today, no complaint from the owner of the Majorca house is thought to have been received by Civil Guard officers.   Becker , 50, was declared bankrupt last June after blowing his \u0026pound100m fortune.  The triple Wimbledon champion’s wife Lilly vowed to stand by him but revealed in March their marriage came close to collapsing.  The retired tennis star purchased his Majorcan villa in 1995 and briefly put it on the market in 2007 for a figure reported to be close \u0026pound13million before withdrawing it shortly afterwards. Locals in Arta said last year around the time he was declared bankrupt they had not seen Becker for years. The pundit is thought to own Son Coll through a Spanish company.

That still amazes Dixon.“Honestly, knowing Kev’s talent when he went down to Burnley and got promoted to the Premier League, I expected him to do what Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson have,” he said.“I was sure it would be a stepping stone to one of the top-six clubs down there because that is the kind of ability he has.“He was thrown in at the deep end at Dundee, like a few of us were, but he quickly became a very big player in the team and it wasn’t a surprise when English clubs started watching him every week.“Burnley seemed a good move for him because he was getting a game and they got promoted but something went wrong and it knocked him back for a while.“What exactly the story was I don’t know and maybe we never will, but for me the good thing is he is back in with a chance of getting up to the highest level again.“I have to say when you look at the clubs he’s played for down south and the number of games he’s had, you would never say he’s had a bad career.“It’s just that he belongs in their Premier League and I really do hope Fulham win tomorrow and he can spend the next few seasons at that level.”He notes with interest McDonald is no longer the attacking midfielder of his Dens days, but tends to be the man who sits a touch deeper.For him, that’s just a another sign of his all-round ability.“Kev was very much an attacking midfielder when we played together but the times I have seen Fulham on television this season he has had more of a holding role.“He can still get forward and chip in with a few goals and he’ll be a very important player for them at Wembley.”Such is the “small world” nature of football that McDonald is not the only reason Dixon will be rooting for the Cottagers in a game that could earn the winners £160 million, even if they were to be relegated this time next year.“Oliver Norwood plays beside Kev in their midfield and I played in the same team as him at Huddersfield, so it would be good to see them both go up.“I even know the other midfielder, Stefan Johansen because I played against him a few times when he was at Celtic and I was at United.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/08/598c50e5ced49-e1505748380849-940x557.jpg ","title":"poll do you back a name change for dundees dens park home","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDens Park could be set for a historic name change ahead of next season’s kick-off.The Tele revealed earlier this week that Dundee FC, which has played at Dens since 1899, may be set to incorporate the name Kilmac into the stadium title.Sources have said the name change would be similar to that introduced by former Premier League counterparts Partick Thistle FC, who now play at The Energy Check Stadium at Firhill.We want to know whether you think a naming rights deal is a good idea to give the Dark Blues more income.Simply answer yes or no below.Dens Park no more?

signed a deal until 2021 with the Championship Canaries in January and was loaned back to the Dons for the remainder of the campaign.McLean is in South America with the Scotland squad for the friendlies against Peru and Mexico.Former Dons team-mates Shinnie and Scott McKenna are in Alex McLeish’s squad.Celtic’s Ryan Christie, who was on loan at the Dons, is also part of the Scottish contingent.McLean is rooming with Shinnie on the South America trip and is delighted he is set to earn a debut cap.McLean said: “I’m especially pleased for Shinnie.“The other three of us have been in the squad for the past couple of games and Shinnie’s really deserved his call-up.“He’s been excellent throughout the season and his hard work has had the recognition it deserves.“It (call-ups) shows how well Aberdeen have done this season.”McLean is set to win his fourth Scotland cap in the upcoming friendlies.He earned a debut cap in a 1-0 defeat of the Czech Republic in Prague in March 2016.He followed that up with an appearance in the 1-0 loss to Holland at Pittodrie under interim manager Malky Mackay last November.New boss McLeish handed McLean another cap in the 1-0 defeat of Hungary in

little sunshine in your life","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFolllowing on from its fantastic tour in 2010, Sunshine On Leith is set to return to His Majesty’s.Featuring classic songs from popular Scottish band The Proclaimers, Sunshine On Leith follows the story of Ally and his friend Davy as they return home from the Army.The show sees them being confronted with civilian life, relationships, blind dates and other commitments.As these characters slowly rediscover their sense of identity, they start to question what home really means to them.Director James Brining thinks the musical, which also puts spotlight on Scottish history and political unrest, is more relevant than ever.He said: “As the UK questions whether it is still one country and what ‘Britain’ means in the 21st Century, this show questions if your roots and your home really define you.“With the beautiful, barnstorming, popular songs of The Proclaimers as its soundtrack, the show never fails to ignite big and powerful emotions from its audience.”Steven Miller, who portrays Davy, said that to an extent, he has some things in common with the character he plays.He said he fully understands how Davy feels when he gets home after being far away for a long period of time.The actor said: “I have been living in London for 18 years and I left when I was 19, so I have almost been there for longer that I have not been there if you know what I mean.”Steven said that it always feels right to go home even though everything is different and changed.He added: “So I guess there is that sort of feeling and connection to the character.“Ultimately, it is home. I think that the question is ‘What is home to you?’.”Steven suggested that home means different things to different people.He said: “For me, personally, the idea of home is Scotland because that is where I was born, that is where I grew up.“There is that idea of home as the place where I lay my head at night, which ultimately is a flat in London. “But there is also the idea of home which is wherever my partner is.“So there are many different ideas of home!”If he was asked to summarise the show in three words, Steven would say it is all about “love, family and change”.Even though Steven was well aware of The Proclaimers before he was cast to play Davy, he was surprised how many tunes he recognised.Steven, whose favourite song to perform is Letter from America, suggested that the show is very detailed.He said: “The musical supervisor of the show has done, I think, a spectacular job of taking some raw energy and heart of The Proclaimers music and bringing it to the stage.“It is expanded in different ways to encapsulate different things.“It is beautiful.”Steven is certain attendees do not have to be The Proclaimers’ fans to enjoy the wonderful musical.He said: “It is a story about relationships, love and meaning of life.“Each number feels like a part of that journey.”The Proclaimers’ singer Charlie Reid said that while their songs were never written with theatre in mind, “some of them do seem to have strong themes which lend themselves to a play”.Theatre and musical lovers can see Sunshine On Leith next Tuesday to Saturday at His Majesty’s.

A footway is to be installed on the northern side of the B987 connecting to the existing network within Kintore.“Bus services operate along the B987, linking the station to the centre of Kintore, Kemnay, Inverurie and Aberdeen with stops provided in the vicinity of the proposed station.“Transportation is therefore satisfied with the sustainable travel accessibility.

He added: “Paddy has really good experience and he is a really good player.“He’s a good defender, he’s a good talker which is important and he steps into the game really well from the left-back position.“We’re really pleased with how Aidan McIlduff performed at left-back for us this season.“But we’re still in the dark as to what Aidan will be doing next season.“So when Paddy became available it was a no-brainer to sign him.“Paddy was disappointed he was released at the end of the season by Ayr United.“Up until the last few games of the season he was playing and I think he was a bit disappointed.”Boyle has had a long career.

There are no rules or limits to the imagination – they may want to be a wizard or superhero.If a child does not know what they want to be they can decorate their hat with something they are passionate about such as a sport, graffiti art, dancing shoes, or musical instrument.The idea behind the fun is to raise money for the UK’s leading children\u0026#8217s charity to help give thousands of disadvantaged children a better future. When they go into school, nursery or playgroup on May 18, parents and carers can make a voluntary donation of £1 to £2 to Barnardo\u0026#8217s Scotland.Children are full of surprises, and this is a fun way of allowing their imaginations to run wild in a way that will be inspiring, educational and raise money to help transform the lives of children who desperately need our support.It is easy to sign up on our website where you\u0026#8217ll find lots of resources and ideas to ensure your fundraising Hat Day will be a huge success and help support the children and young people we support in your local community.To register, visit www.barnardos.org.uk/hatday. Here you\u0026#8217ll find everything you need to make the event a success at your school, nursery or playgroup.Our resources section has school posters, sample letters for parents and hat-making guides. Contact regional relationships manager for Scotland, Jennifer Keegan on Jennifer.Keegan@Barnardos.org.uk for further information or assistance.To help with ideas, Barnardo\u0026#8217s is launching a separate \u0026#8216Top Hat\u0026#8217 competition for teachers/parents for best hat in the run up to Hat Day, with a poll to decide the winner on the Barnardo\u0026#8217s Community Fundraising facebook page.Martin Crewe, director for Barnardo\u0026#8217s ScotlandSir,I write concerning the blight of ferry disruptions across my council ward, particularity on the island of Islay.We cannot allow CalMac\u0026#8217s management blunders and lack of funding from the Scottish Government to act as a ball and chain which is holding back my local ward\u0026#8217s fast industrial growth.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the UK.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

Moore took the free-kick, but his curling effort from 27 yards lacked power.Moore, however, was not to be denied his hat-trick and 60 seconds later  steered a good low finish past Scott Urquhart\u0026#8217s left hand.The early first-half jitters returned to the League defence just after the hour mark when hesitation in the box allowed Nikki MacDougall, of host club Tarbert, to nip in and force the ball past Urquhart from nine yards to add a fifth goal for Argyll.A flurry of changes from both sides with 16 minutes remaining saw Scott Soudan and Lewis MacNaughton replace MacDougall and McCallum for Argyll.The league adjusted quicker to the changes and Kyle Reid and Robbie Martin combined well for Martin to pull a goal back in the 77th minute.With five minutes remaining, Soudan\u0026#8217s tenacity in the box robbed Daniel Smith on the six yard line and left him one-on-one with Urquhart.Soudan\u0026#8217s stabbed effort was stopped by Urquhart\u0026#8217s outstretched right foot but, typical of his luck on the day, the rebound fell kindly for the Campbeltown Pupils\u0026#8217 striker who rounded the prostrate Urquhart and walked the ball into the empty net.The full-time whistle ended an entertaining encounter with the players and officials retiring to the Islay Frigate Hotel for the presentation ceremony.The Duncan MacDougall man of the match award was given to Red Star\u0026#8217s Kieran Moore.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sun brings out the best in lochgilphead golfers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 17/05/18, 2:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOn a lovely sunny Sunday the gents competed to gain a place to play in this year\u0026#8217s match and knockout competition.Jim Hunter was excited to return a nett score of 58, six strokes below par.

It was a gamble \u0026#8211 but one that paid off, with the business now turning over millions each year.He left the business \u0026#8216at least 10 years ago\u0026#8217, but was a very interested visitor at last week\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216Fyne at 40\u0026#8217 celebrations \u0026#8211 more on pages 16 and 17 \u0026#8211 to mark the company\u0026#8217s four decades in business.\u0026#8216Looking back, I feel quite astonished really,\u0026#8217 he told the Advertiser.\u0026#8216I mean, away back we had a wooden hut, but before that there was a fish box and an umbrella. We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

Red Star won their only previous title \u0026#8211 SAFL Fourth Division \u0026#8211 in 1988 under manager Hughie Lindsay. There have been promotions, relegations and plenty of drama in between, but never a league crown.Red Star manager Dougie Moore said: \u0026#8216This is a major achievement for the club and for a small town like Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216We only have a small squad, but with some excellent players, many of whom have been involved with the Soccer Centre, which deserves great credit.\u0026#8216Seeing them play football with a smile and allowing them to express themselves on the pitch has been extremely pleasing and a personal highlight.\u0026#8217Led by Pipe Major Craig Lang and lead drummer Graeme MacMillan, Mid Argyll Pipe Band won the British Pipe Band Championship at Grade 4B.Craig, now in his sixth season leading the band, was \u0026#8216absolutely delighted\u0026#8217 to clinch first place among 21 competing bands.He added: \u0026#8216The band had an average age of 18 on Saturday at Paisley with four players in their first competition, one still in primary school.\u0026#8216It has taken years of hard work and a lot of that can be credited to Rod Buchanan for chanter lessons and Donald MacLachlan, our drum tutor.\u0026#8216It is also a great result for Graeme MacMillan, who returned after a five-year absence from the pipe band circuit to win a major.\u0026#8217The band celebrated in style on their return from Paisley with an impromptu performance in Lochgilphead town centre to the delight of band parents and supporters.Before heading to Tarbert on Sunday May 27 to play at the Scottish Series sailing event, Mid Argyll Pipe Band will be at the Ropework in Lochgilphead the day before to help Red Star celebrate.Star will receive the Premier 2 trophy at 3.45pm on Saturday and it is an occasion not to be missed.PICS:Mid Argyll Pipe Band members celebrates after their championship success. no_a21MAPBchamps01Pipe Major Craig Lang clutches the British championship trophy. 06_a21PipeBand08Lochgilphead Red Star AFC, league champions. 06_a18RedStar_TeamPhoto_home01\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 21","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/05/18, 5:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Many thanks to Robert Wakeham, writing in last week’s Advertiser, for his questions regarding the nesting colony and status of common gulls within the former oil depot, currently the Mid Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

Council chiefs shut a popular seafront tower amid safety fears in March. Now they have warned that the unit, enjoyed annually by thousands, will lie dormant until “later this year”. The multi-play tower is awaiting a \u0026pound260,000 overhaul after “a number of health and safety risks” were uncovered. Other equipment is still in use, but the giant climbing frame which anchors the park remains roped off. The lack of progress on a replacement has led to discontent among parents and political figures. Ayr west councillor, Martin Dowey, said: “As a tourist town, getting this replaced should have been high priority.  “Thousands of families will come to our beach over the summer and be left disappointed. “It is sadly indicative of a lack of progress from the council on many issues at the seafront.” Councillors signed off \u0026pound260,000 in their March budget to fund a replacement for the old play tower, which lasted 23 years. A council spokesman said: “The seafront play park remains open with funds agreed for a new play tower following the budget decision in March. “We are set to dismantle the old equipment in the next few weeks. “The new tower will be made to order and we expect it to be delivered later this year, it will then take a few weeks to install.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12321370.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/mwr_ayp_240917Shankland.jpg","title":"ayr united goal machine lawrence","story":"NewsAyr United goal machine Lawrence Shankland hails his best weekend in footballAlthough the 29-goal striker didn’t play in their title-winning match against Albion, he played a huge part in Ayr finishing top.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet16:33, 2 MAY 2018Updated16:59, 2 MAY 2018NewsLawrence Shankland wins the PFA Scotland League 1 Player of the Year Award (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGoal machine Lawrence Shankland has hailed his best weekend in football.

Ambassador Bowling Club president Anne Gibson said South Ayrshire Council’s new money spinner will stop some elderly members from getting out of the house. Ms Gibson said the Prestwick club is a social lifeline for older people including widowed folk. And during the cold, dark winter months it is somewhere safe to go to keep elderly people active. Finance bosses at the council want drivers to pay at Bellevue Road car park near the club and swimming pool. It is believed the move, which will roll out in other towns, will coin in \u0026pound120,000.  Anne said: “Our club is a social hub for elderly members. Eighty per cent of our members are aged over 73. They already pay because it is a private club. “We worry the car parking charge on top of that wil mean they can no longer afford it. There is a real threat the club may close or the parking charges will drive down membership numbers.” It is estimated the new fees will add \u0026pound3 to every game played. Anne continued: “South Ayrshire Council are supposed to encourage sport and leisure. This car park is used for the bowling club and the swimming pool. This should be a special case.” Describing individual member experiences, Anne said: “One of the men said he is recently widowed. He was depressed in the winter and said the bowling club was a Godsend to combat loneliness.  “His story is echoed by lots of people. Members have said if the club closed they don’t know what they would do. One lady had a fall and the doctor advised exercise like bowling, which is essential for health. They don’t like going out walking on their own. We offer a warm and friendly environment.” Coaching and rink space for blind bowlers is also provided. And young junior members are being coached to an international standard. She added: “Parking at a distance could prove hazardous for older members in icy or slippy conditions but that may be their only option if charges are introduced.” The club are collecting signatures for a petition.

Heartbroken Margaret Hogg lost son Robert, aged just seven, and daughter Meghan at 27. Now she says the pain of weekly trips to their resting place has been turned to dread due to dirt over their lair. It comes amid claims that dogs are being allowed to “roam loose” at Ayr Cemetery. Margaret, pictured above with her brother, Michael Bashta, said: “It is upsetting enough to make this journey every week. “Both of my children died in my arms and it is something you never get over.  “Robert passed away after a car accident and Meghan had a blood clot in her lungs. “I try to make their grave as nice as possible but time and again it is ruined.” Margaret, who says fouling is an ongoing problem at the Holmston Road cemetery, believes some owners are using the graveyard as a walking route. She said: “I was approaching the grave one day when a woman saw me coming and quickly put her dog back on its lead. “The steam was still rising from the dirt when I got there. It is sickening that people can show that lack of respect. “It’s not the dog’s fault – but why are people taking them into a cemetery in the first place? “They should be banned from somewhere like that.”  Ayr MSP John Scott is among those calling for owners to clean up their act. He said: “Managing the behaviour of dogs is part of being a responsible dog owner and, of all places, this should be true in a place like a cemetery. “I have contacted South Ayrshire Council over this matter and hope that they will take all steps open to them to ensure that fouling is dealt with at Ayr Cemetery, as indeed it should be everywhere else locally.” A council spokesman said: “Signage is in place in our cemeteries to remind dog owners to respect South Ayrshire, keep their dogs under control at all times and clean up after their pets. “When this does not happen, the council is prepared to use enforcement action.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"freeloader who befriended 83 year","story":"NewsFreeloader who befriended 83-year-old jailed for pinching his cashStranger Laura Cowley wormed her way into the life of former miner Peter Bicker after approaching him in the street.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley16:21, 22 MAY 2018NewsLaura Cowley\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA scrounger who befriended an 83-year-old man before nicking his wallet has been jailed.

No other disposal other than custody is appropriate.” He jailed her for another 90 days for shouting, swearing and uttering threats of violence at Ayr Hospital on January 18. Sheriff Montgomery said the “court would not tolerate such behaviour” towards medical staff and the emergency services. Cowley has failed to comply with a drug testing and treatment order (DTTO). She appeared in the dock from custody following a guilty plea to the theft of Mr Bicker’s wallet at an earlier hearing.  Her lawyer John Gallagher said being taken into custody “saved her life.” He said her behaviour in the last four to six weeks has been “night and day” compared to the past. An earlier hearing heard how big-hearted Mr Bicker had been happy to assist Cowley with money and accommodation until his daughter told her to to never come back. But she repaid Mr Bicker’s generosity by turning up at his door on July 29 asking for money. As he took out his wallet, she snatched it away popping it in her handbag. Cowley also admitted five shoplifting charges in Ayr High Street from 2017. Sentence was deferred for good behaviour. Sheriff Montgomery said: “Hopefully you will be released in due course in a better place than you have been in for a long time.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12552838.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/aor_ekn_230518_raceday_01.jpg","title":"horse racing preview lockinge hamilton","story":"NewsHorse racing preview: Lockinge and Hamilton take centre stageThe Lockinge takes centre stage on Saturday, while Hamilton\u0027s Friday night card is also a cracker.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post17:07, 17 MAY 2018Updated10:11, 18 MAY 2018NewsLibrisa Breeze, right, could run well at a big price, says Julie (Image: Getty Images Europe)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLockinge Day at Newbury on Saturday looks to be a belter, writes bookmaker Julie Williams. The current going is good to firm. And in a clutch of Group and Listed races, it’s the Lockinge Stakes at 3.40pm over the straight mile which definitely warrants most attention. It’s a race where the winner is too often easy to find in the market. Short priced favourites account for seven of the last 10 winners. In an open race, RHODODENDRON (7/2), LIMATO (9/2) have attracted money at the head of the market. Trained by Dean Ivory for renowned gambler Tony Bloom, LIBRISA BREEZE (16/1) is not without his chances. A Group 1 winner at Ascot last year on soft ground, the six-year-old\u0027s best form to date has come on an easier surface. As a son of MOUNT NELSON whose progeny have a 20 per cent strike rate on good to firm ground, I would, however, not be put off. Given there are chinks in the armour of the top two in the betting, LIBRISA BREEZE (16/1) looks a nice each way prospect nonetheless to be picking them up late. Closer to home and we have some great racing at Hamilton this Friday evening to enjoy.  It serves as an opportunity for racing fans to see not just the whites of the eyes of bookmakers they are looking to fleece but those of the beautiful thoroughbreds, the equine athletes, who make the sport so much more than just a numbers game. The pre-parade ring is the place to catch a glance of them. Set back from the paddock, without saddle cloth or tack to mar your view, it is here you will see if your fancy has missed a bit of work, or is on its toes, toned, muscled and fit to go. No horse can win a race in the paddock but it is easier to spot one who is likely to leave their race there. First up at 5.55pm is the Novice Stakes – a five furlong dash in which six of the last 10 favourites have gone in. In that time stall five has proved bountiful for punters with four bold winners breaking from there. I love Hamilton, but it has not always been kind to me by way of results. Forgive me for saying I hope the favourite gets sunk this time! The top race on the card goes to the stayers. The 1m 4 furlong trip of the Braveheart Handicap at 7.30pm has drawn entries from Newmarket yards such as that of Saeed Bin Suroor and Roger Varian. Not only will their horses have to outstay the field, the trainers will have to outwit the likes of Jim Goldie, Keith Dalgleish and Mark Johnston. It is not quite a battle between North and South but it may feel that way should Jim Goldie’s THEGLASGOWWARRIOR land the pot of \u0026pound25k. The Uplawmoor-based yard have saddled three winners of this in the last decade. SIR CHAUVELIN had improved by a stone when he doubled up to run out a fine winner in last year’s renewal. After a gutsy win at Musselburgh last time out and racing off bottom weight, THEGLASGOWWARRIOR (12/1) will have his supporters. I will be one of them.

The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

Lauren said: “We were introduced to each other in Magaluf by mutual friends having gone on separate holidays. “However, it was around six months later, in early 2012, before we started dating and our wedding day was on our six-year anniversary. “In October 2013, Graeme moved in with me in my house in Bellfield where we still live with our two cats, Baxter and Chichi.” The couple tied the knot at the Dumfries Arms Hotel in Cumnock on Saturday, March 24, this year.  “The sun was shining all day,” said Lauren. “The day went perfectly with no issues at all – we couldn’t have asked for better!” The bride’s wedding gown was from Brides of Scotland in East Kilbride with the kilts being from MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick. The wedding party consisted of bridesmaids Lisa Robertson, Ashley Brown and Michelle Dornan best man Gordon Mcfadyean and ushers Mark Wason and Dale Goldie. The couple opted for a closer to home getaway after the wedding but have big plans for the summer.  Lauren said: “We went to Edinburgh for a few days the week after the wedding but have our honeymoon booked in June in Cancun, Mexico.” Karen Simpson Photography captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with a gorgeous collection to look back on. Wild Wood Flowers in Prestwick pieced together the bouquets for the day with Westcoast Cakes in Largs creating the couple’s wedding cake. Groom Graeme designed the traditonal three-tier wedding cake that included tiny figures of the couple’s cats. Jacqui Harrow created the beauty looks while Heather Errici styled the hair on the big day. Lauren added: “We would like to thank Caroline at the Dumfries Arms Hotel for making our day so perfect and both sets of parents for their help and contributions.” Have you been married recently and would love your big day featured?

Entertainment will see a parade leading off from Sainsbury’s in the town from 11.30am, including Clydesdale horses and a motorcade of classic cars and bikes.

Developer Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel want to extend planning permission at Greenan until 2024, Alloway and Doonfoot Community Council heard last week. The planning application for the huge Dunure Road development was granted in 2010 to build 500 houses, a care home and shops. Community Council Chair Marilyn Dalgleish said the planning process had already lasted for the length of time a child attends school. Marilyn said: “It will be 2024 before the development is finished. This has been going on for so long. They want to add another six years.” She added: “Why should a developer keep pushing and pushing the boundaries?”  Last week’s community council meeting in Alloway Primary School heard folk don’t feel the style of housing is in keeping with the area. Alloway resident, Andrew Russell, said there should be more bungalows in the development. Marilyn added: “We go to the bother of putting in objections but we don’t know if anyone is actually reading them.” The community council intends to object to the latest time extension. Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel are halfway through the work. Members are seething after councillors approved a towering care home on an elevated position on Dunure Road boasting stunning views. Originally the home was supposed to go on land lower down but the spot was changed – prompting uproar. People mounted a campaign to stop it, with a roadside protest during a councillor visit to the location.  Community council secretary Brendan Ferguson said: “They located the care home on the road in a position which was much higher, and bigger that was originally approved. “I think the whole local population was shocked with the way the care home was driven through despite all the objections.” Inverness-based care firm, Mealmore Ltd will employ 60 staff at the base on a two-acre plot. The two-storey build will soar to almost 13 metres. A spokeswoman at Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes said: “Our most recent application to the council is solely to seek approval to extend the outline planning permission expiry date to allow us to complete the five phases of construction on a site allocated for housing in the local development plan. “This will ensure continuity of delivery of much needed private and affordable homes as well as contributing financially to the local schools and bus service.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "}]
