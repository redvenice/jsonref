Nothing more to it than that.\u0027Sir Keir repeated his apology for questioning the truth of Mr Johnson\u0027s statement that the Opposition leader had previously said it would be better for the UK to remain a member of the European Union\u0027s medicines regulator.The former director of public prosecutions had said Mr Johnson was talking \u0027complete nonsense\u0027 after the Conservative Party leader accused him of repeatedly calling for the UK to stay in the EMA, suggesting such a move would have hampered the country\u0027s Covid-19 vaccine rollout.Sir Keir apologised for the error after it was pointed out that Hansard, the official record of Parliament, had recorded him in January 2017 questioning why the UK would want to leave the EMA and that it should be something retained as part of the Brexit process.\u0027I had misheard what the Prime Minister was putting to me, I was wrong about that and, as I say, hands up, I got it wrong.

We\u0027re now at the same levels of new cases we were when we came out of lockdown at the end of November, with the difference being our NHS is overstretched and death rates are still high. \u0027Importantly, we still need to give the vaccines a few more weeks to take effect and drive cases lower. If as hoped these trends continue, I believe we should now be looking at getting children back into the classrooms sooner, so vaccinating teachers would be my next priority.\u0027Meanwhile, the government today revealed it expects to have vaccinated all over-50s before May 6 as Boris Johnson plots a route to freedom.The Cabinet Office disclosed the schedule as it confirmed that elections in England will take place on that date - citing the fact that the top nine groups will have received jabs as a reason it can \u0027go ahead with these polls with confidence\u0027.Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi repeatedly refused to give a timetable for completing the first phase of the rollout - totalling 32million people - in interviews yesterday.But the government said today: \u0027The UK\u0027s vaccination programme is planned to have reached all nine priority cohorts by May, meaning that the Government can commit to go ahead with these polls with confidence - and maintain the choice for voters between voting in person or remotely.\u0027However, the news is likely to fuel pressure from Tories to speed up easing of lockdown. The head of the 70-strong Covid Recovery Group has called for restrictions to be lifted altogether once all over-50s have been offered doses.As optimism rises about the vaccination programme, the PM is preparing to bring back outdoor mixing and sport once children are back in school from March 8, with hopes of a \u0027quick return to normal\u0027 in April and May.One Whitehall source said: \u0027If the vaccine programme goes the way we think it will go, then you will start to see quite a quick return to normal in April and May.\u0027According to the Times, both team and solo sports could be given the green light to resume within weeks of March 8 - the day pupils are supposed to go back to the classroom.Outdoor socialising could also be allowed around the same time, reflecting scientific consensus that coronavirus finds it harder to spread in the fresh air.The Prime Minister\u0027s blueprint - due to be unveiled formally on February 22 - will also earmark dates for non-essential shops and pubs, which have been shut since the third national lockdown came into force in January, to finally reopen.Mr Johnson is also understood to be eager to overhaul complex rules that had required pub-goers in some areas to order a \u0027substantial meal\u0027 with alcohol, drawing scorn when ministers were forced to clarify that a scotch egg counted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1444756e99a73fb5d4b2a2bc4d3faaff33f14441/558_586_1386_832/master/1386.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2206b20bb3d66556dad50f95196bddd5","title":"abstract genius ray k metzker photographs in pictures","story":"A new exhibition showcases the American virtuoso’s bold and experimental way of working.

That was after several years when ministers said they wanted to turbo-charge the insulation of British homes, only for those plans to be shelved.“For the first time in a long time we can see a positive picture,” he said.His staff assess whether homes need cavity wall insulation, external rendering, ground source heat pumps or underfloor heating before arranging for the work to be done and later checking it is up to a high standard.This year he expects to employ an extra 50 HQ staff to cope with the flow of business from the government’s “10-point plan for a green industrial revolution” and particularly the seventh element: greener buildings.About 50,000 jobs are due to be created in the building sector to meet emissions targets that Johnson believes will meet the UK’s obligations ahead of the United Nations Cop26 summit in Glasgow later this year.The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who unveiled a £3bn post-pandemic green package last year that Labour described as inadequate, is expected to support the 10-point plan in his budget on 3 March with extra cash to meet a more ambitious £9.2bn Conservative manifesto pledge to improve the energy efficiency of homes, schools and hospitals.In the meantime, the government’s Green Homes Grant (GHG), which opened for business in September, is the main vehicle.Plagued by teething problems, the GHG voucher scheme was due to dispense £2bn by the end of this March giving homeowners two-thirds of the cost of energy-efficient improvements, up to a maximum of £5,000 a household, or the full cost up to £10,000 if residents have low incomes.Payment delays forced many installers to down tools and stop recruitment. Within three months of the launch, an embarrassed department of business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) had extended the scheme to March 2022.Horrocks, who is also head of the insulation industry body and regularly negotiates with officials from BEIS, recognises that finding 50,000 workers will be difficult while the construction industry is weighed down by its reputation as a cyclical business that traditionally hires and fires in sync with the ups and downs of property prices.“The industry is not the first choice for young people. It is not considered a desirable career. And that will only change if we reach out and convince them there are lots of opportunities in this green business,” he said.Training grants play a large part in his plans for expansion. Workers who render homes with insulating material can gain NVQs while architects are offered the necessary qualifications to become home assessors.The financial rewards are also good, with specialist trades people earning more the £50,000 a year and mostly working indoors, unlike many construction workers.Industry optimism, however, is not universal. Simon Blackham, technical manager at insulation board manufacturer Recticel says the government’s funding initiatives are still too short term. That, he says, prevents firms from making major commitments to raise staff numbers.Regulations covering residential developments are another sore point. New homes will not have to meet tough emissions standards until 2025. Until then, only the most basic insulation is needed to satisfy the rules.“We can produce enough insulation panels for as many zero-carbon homes as the industry can build right now. There is plenty of manufacturing capacity. So there is no reason why we can’t build passive homes from today,” he said.Factories producing insulating materials are largely automated and job numbers are likely to stay largely the same, said Blackham, though he would increase staffing levels in marketing, warehousing and distribution should sales improve.Simon Storer, chief executive of the Insulation Manufacturers Association, agreed that a firmer commitment from the government to insulate homes would guarantee manufacturing jobs rather than increase them.Economists say the same outlook applies to all parts of the UK’s “green” manufacturing sector: automation already dominates production and limits the creation of skilled jobs.Michael Pollitt, a business economist at the Judge Business school, Cambridge University, said that while 35 jobs are created in the broader recycling industry for every £1m invested, only 10 jobs are created by opening a gigafactory (battery factory). In the windfarm sector £1m creates just two jobs. The average for “green jobs” is five per £1m invested.Any chance of a manufacturing bonanza is further undermined by the trend for much of the highly profitable, green industrial equipment to be developed and constructed abroad, from wind turbines to electric cars.Philip McCann, chair in urban and regional economics at Sheffield University’s management school, says the UK has struggled to develop a green industrial base because a postwar gap persists between innovative startup businesses and their larger cousins that might translate profitable ideas into mass production.A lack of skills training is another. “It is not a lack of money, it is about an over-centralised system when in the US and continental Europe, regions and cities have power and can tailor their support.”Pollitt argues that Britain’s relatively small manufacturing base makes it ideally suited to making the transition to a zero-carbon economy. A flexible labour force also means that workers who find themselves unemployed, or in sectors damaged by the pandemic, can easily make the transition.“Britain’s advantage is that it has a largely decarbonised service sector that dominates the economy. If the UK cannot decarbonise then it is hard to see what country can.”But he also fears that the meagre sums of money dedicated to green grants and subsidies and the limited funding horizon will turn off workers.“Green jobs are seen as part of a short-term transition while the existing stock – which could be homes or power stations – are replaced.”That means green jobs do not look like a career even though a target to reach net zero by 2050 would make them an option for most people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e627ff32a661ab70008525eed8dd3b6bfa394fd0/0_137_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6fe0eb7875396e57c5cd49b1d02dfa2","title":"ofgem energy price cap markets us jobs data brexit business live","story":"Sterling has also had a good week and is on track for its fourth week of gains. It is edging higher against both the dollar and the euro after the Bank of England put negative interest rates on the back burner. The central bank told banks to prepare for a potential cut below zero in six months’ time. Connor Campbell, a financial analyst at trading platform Spreadex, says:The vaccine rollout is still going very well so that is probably an underlying positive for UK markets at the moment.However, signs of any delay or slowdown in the pace of the vaccine rollouts will be a huge obstacle in the coming weeks or months.The drop in UK house prices recorded by Halifax in January mirrors that reported by Nationwide building society – the two closely watched house price surveys – and suggests that the turn of the year coincided with a change of momentum in house prices. Andrew Wishart, property economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, says prices are likely to drop back this year as the stamp duty holiday ends on 31 March and unemployment continues to rise.With both Halifax and Nationwide recording a drop in January, the looming end of the stamp duty holiday in March appears to be reversing the 2020 house price surge. Both indexes are based on mortgage approvals, which are normally secured about two months before completion. Very high transaction volumes have led to delays in conveyancing, so the drop in prices probably reflects the increasing likelihood that those at the approval stage of the home moving process will miss out on the tax saving.On the vaccine front, the US drugmaker Pfizer said today that it had withdrawn an application in India for emergency use authorisation of the Covid-19 vaccine it developed with Germany’s BioNTech. Pfizer failed to conduct a local trial, unlike other companies that have conducted small studies in India. In January, Indian regulators approved the vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, along with another shot created in India by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research.This means that the PfizerBioNTech vaccine will not be available in the two countries with the biggest populations, India and China. Pfizer said this week that it expects to rake in $15bn sales from the vaccine this year, and raised its profit outlook on the back of it.China is using a locally-developed vaccine, by Sinovac. Its CoronaVac shot has been given to tens of thousands of people in China under an emergency use programme, even though it has not been formally approved yet. Regulators are also reviewing another vaccine for approval, developed by the state-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group, known as Sinopharm.Back to our main story about Ofgem’s decision to lift the cap on energy prices, which will put £96 on households’ bills, to £1,138. The price comparison website MoneySuperMarket says there are 80 tariffs cheaper than the regulator’s new benchmark.Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, says:There are some early signs that the upturn in the housing market could be running out of steam, with the annual rate of house price inflation cooling to its lowest level since August. Industry figures for agreed sales remain well above pre-pandemic levels but new instructions to sell have decreased noticeably, and total stock held by estate agents has risen to its highest level since before the EU referendum in 2016. The stamp duty holiday has undoubtedly helped to fuel growing demand amongst households for larger properties. However, given the current time to completion across the market, transactions in the early part of 2021 probably don’t include many borrowers who expect to benefit from the stamp duty reprieve. How far and how deep any slowdown proves to be is a challenge to predict given the prevailing uncertainty created by the pandemic. With swathes of the economy still shuttered, and joblessness continuing to edge higher, on the surface this points to slower market activity and downward price pressures in the near-term. That said, we saw the power of homeowners to drive the market in the second half of last year as many people looked to find new properties with greater space, spurred on by increased time spent at home. Such structural demand changes, coupled with any further policy interventions by government, could yet sustain underlying market activity for some time to come.In Asia, shares in the Chinese video app Kuaishou nearly tripled on the first day of trading in Hong Kong, giving TikTok’s chief rival a market value of $180bn, Mark Sweney reports. The debut of the short form video site on Hong Mong’s stock exchange on Friday has been one of the most eagerly-anticipated initial public offerings this year and raised $5.4bn (£4bn). The company’s stock jumped 194 per cent in early trading on Friday at HK$338 from the initial public offering price of HK$115.  Kuaishou, which made a $1.1bn loss last year, competes in China with ByteDance, the owner of TikTok and its Chinese sister app Douyin. The company says that it has around 300 million daily active users, who spend an average of 86 minutes or more on the app.  The company makes money from activity including taking a small cut of the “tips” users leave for the creators that make content they particularly like, which come in the form of virtual gifts such as small digital “stickers” of objects, which accounts for about 62 per cent of total revenues. It also makes money from livestreaming e-commerce, sometimes fronted by celebrities to try and attract more buyers, as well as online buyers. Kuaishou’s revenues grew from $1.3bn in 2017 to $6.2bn in the nine months ended September 30, 2020, however it still reported a loss of $1.1bn.The struggling clothing retailer French Connection has received two separate takeover offers from potential suitors, reports my colleague Mark Sweney.The company, which unsuccessfully sought to find a buyer in 2019, said it has been approached by the retail investor Spotlight Brands, with backing from the restructuring and investment firm Gordon Brothers.The second approach has come from the brand investment platform Go Global Retail, in conjunction with HMJ International Services. French Connection said any offer is likely to be in cash, and cautioned:Discussions with both Spotlight and Go Global remain at a very early stage.

Energy suppliers must also continue to ensure support is easy for consumers to access.Customers on standard or default tariffs who want to avoid a price hike should switch to a different provider or deal as this remains the best way to keep your bills down. Do your research, shop around and switch - you could find a deal £260 cheaper than the new price cap level.The manufacturing sector has held up better than services in recent months, as shops, restaurants, bars and hotels have been much harder hit by being forced to close during lockdowns.And Citizens Advice notes that the energy price increase will coincide with a change in universal credit. Alistair Cromwell, acting chief executive of the consumer group, says:This increase will be a heavy blow to a lot of households. For many people on Universal Credit it will come at the same time as the £20 a week increase to the benefit is set to end.With a tough jobs market and essential bills rising, now is not the time for the government to cut this vital lifeline.Richard Neudegg, head of regulation at Uswitch, says: The price cap increase is an aftershock of last year’s lockdown, partly because many customers have struggled to pay their energy bills, plunging them into debt that suppliers have been unable to recover. With more of us at home, usage remains high and energy costs hike, there’s a very real danger that the rising price cap will end up trapping households on default tariffs into a vicious circle of energy debt. The good news is that there are plenty of fixed deals available that would protect households from market volatility and provide not just certainty and reassurance, but significant cost savings. He said the best value fixed deal currently available on the market is £945 from Avro Energy, while the new price cap will sit at £1,138, for typical usage. This means that by switching, households could save themselves £193 across their annual energy bills.Peter Earl, head of energy at the price comparison site comparethemarket, is not impressed with Ofgem’s move. He has urged households to check their tariffs, saying that they could potentially save hundreds of pounds by switching supplier.Raising energy costs for millions of households by an average of £96 is an extraordinary move in the current environment. It calls into question the whole point of a price cap which was designed to protect the most vulnerable households. The additional £23 hit announced earlier this week to recover the costs of unpaid bills in the cap’s ‘Adjustment Allowance’ ignores the fact that many are still in a very difficult and precarious financial situation. It undoes the good work by the industry in supporting customers through the pandemic, which is far from over.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.This morning, Britain’s energy regulator has raised the cap on energy prices for millions of households for the first time in two years, after a big rise in wholesale energy costs. Ofgem announced that from April, the price cap will return to pre-pandemic levels as demand for energy has recovered, which has pushed wholesale prices back up to more normal levels.For six months from 1 April, the price cap will increase by £96 to £1,138 for 11 million default tariff customers, and by £87 to £1,156 for 4 million pre-payment meter customers. The price cap is designed to protect consumers who have not switched energy supplier to ensure they pay a fair price. Ofgem adjusts the cap twice a year to reflect suppliers’ costs of providing electricity and gas.Ofgem has also allowed suppliers to to claim £23 back from the new default tariff price cap level to cover higher levels of bad debt from more customers being unable to pay their energy bills due to the impact of Covid-19.Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem, said: Energy bill increases are never welcome, especially as many households are struggling with the impact of the pandemic. We have carefully scrutinised these changes to ensure that customers only pay a fair price for their energy. The price cap offers a safety net against poor pricing practices, saving customers up to £100 a year, but if they want to avoid the increase in April they should shop around for a cheaper deal. As the UK still faces challenges around Covid-19, during this exceptional time I expect suppliers to set their prices competitively, treat all customers fairly and ensure that any household in financial distress is given access to the support they need.It’s non-farm payrolls day. The US releases its closely watched jobs data for January this afternoon, and the expectation is that the economy added 50,000 new jobs, versus 140,000 lost in December. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote, says:On Wednesday, the ADP report surprised to the upside, printing a solid 174,000 private jobs additions last month, bringing some to think that we could see a similar positive surprise at today’s NFP release. However, it’s worth noting that the correlation between the ADP and NFP is not strong enough to use the ADP number as an indication of the upcoming NFP figure. But the rebound in the most recent PMI data hints at a better-than-expected recovery in US economic activity in January, and we have seen three-consecutive-week fall in unemployment claims following a jump earlier in the year. So, there are factors that would support the expectation of a stronger NFP figure this month. Either way, it’s hard to predict how investors would behave faced with a good or a bad data. A strong figure seems unlikely to discourage risk lovers, but a too strong data could weigh on investor sentiment and lead to some profit taking in risk positions. What’s the limit between strong and too strong is anybody’s guess.The pound rallied yesterday to a near nine-month high against the euro, as the Bank of England put negative interest rates on the back burner.

(They hold out hope, however, of creating a luxury development of science-fiction-esque pod apartments off the coast of New Jersey.)The saga highlights one of the most troubling aspects of what could be called the futurism movement: a majority of the compelling and visible ideas about tomorrow are being conceived and developed by a tiny minority of ultra-wealthy iniduals and private-sector companies.It’s not hard to see the seductive appeal of these visions of the future. Beautiful digital renderings invite us into glowing and highly conceptual worlds, such as Elon Musk and SpaceX’s plan to build a glass-domed colony on Mars, or Jeff Bezos’s plan for floating space colonies. On Earth, Richard Branson’s Virgin Hyperloop One has worked with top architects around the world to produce spectacular, inspiring images of a world connected by zero-emission, 670mph vacuum–propelled pods. Uber, imagining self-flying taxis shuttling riders from roof to roof, unveiled 16 proposals for “skyports” designed by prominent corporate architecture firms. Underground, Musk’s Boring Company promises shorter commute times, while in our homes we are enchanted by the potential of Nest and Alexa. Like any good ideology, this privatized futurism affects everything from global infrastructures to kitchen appliances.These kinds of projects use often fantastic imagery to inspire the public’s imagination and to build consensus around these visions. But unlike many of the forward-thinking proposals of the past – produced by a “public” of academics, artists and government agencies – today’s “future” is almost completely invented by private companies owned by tech billionaires. Why do they care about our imagination? What is at stake when we buy in? What does it mean when the future is privatized?This kind of speculation is ultimately about dictating policy and ownership. If companies control the image of the future, then they control the future itself, and can control the infrastructure. Ultimately, they will define how society functions. Platforms like Amazon Web Services, Facebook and Robinhood have become massive infrastructures that control large parts of our economy and the public sphere.This is not a wholly new phenomenon. At the 1939 World’s Fair, General Motors presented Futurama, an “artistic conception” that outlined their vision for the world of 1960. As Norman Bel Geddes, GM’s designer, wrote about the plans: “There is a Federal obligation to develop the country’s resources of land, water, power, and natural wealth. And there is no single undertaking more important to these obligations than the development of facilities for national transportation.”By arguing for federal government investment, and building public consensus with the help of imagery borrowed from avant-garde artists such as the Italian Futurists, GM contributed to the public consensus that led to the 1956 interstate highway system.However, futuristic ideas about remaking society haven’t always come from private companies with private interests. In the 1960s and 1970s, there were many visions of the future made by artists, academics and public agencies. Technocratic proposals gave form to many of the countercultural ideas of the time. The US navy actually approved Buckminster Fuller’s plans for Triton City, a floating housing development designed for 100,000 people in Chesapeake Bay, and it was commissioned by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.Today’s privatized futures take directly from the utopian proposals of that era. Bezos’s space colonization plan, Blue Origin, nearly copies the work of the physicist Gerard O’Neill’s 1975 work for Nasa. However, the politics are much different. Silicon Valley’s libertarian, technocratic ideals – themselves a curious mutation of the California counterculture – could extend the darker aspects of hyper-capitalism. SpaceX wants to shuttle settlers to Mars for $500,000 a ticket, with loans available that could be worked off. Given the labor record of the tech industry, that sounds awfully like indentured servitude packaged as frontier life. (The MS Satoshi is also a cautionary tale of renderings v reality.)We must envision more public-spirited, collective futures – ones in which the market alone isn’t allowed to dictate everything from housing to environmental regulation to mining rights. Like the futurists of the 1960s and 1970s, can we think in ways that are both stunningly audacious and democratic? At the very least, we have to try.Like the seasteading movement’s difficulties in literally unmooring from the legal system, it seems that every “new world” contains DNA of the old one. European land-use laws defined the United States, which extended into the government-led expansion into the American west. Because someone today has to define tomorrow, it is crucial that we do not leave the image of the future in the deciding hands of tech billionaires."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e80675858d5d50e1efa96b6ce3558372157eddac/0_171_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=cf540ccee54a7fd2d32d08253082b538","title":"tell us have you switched to a stem subject at university","story":"We want to hear from students who have switched from the arts and humanities to a science-related subject Latest statistics from Ucas show that the number of students accepted for arts and humanities subjects has fallen in recent years.

Joe Root is a ton up in his 100th Test, and fellow Yorkshireman Neil Warnock has offered his congratulations. All is not well at Ajax. After Sébastien Haller was mistakenly left out of their Europa League squad comes the news that their goalkeeper, Andre Onana, has been handed a 12-month suspension for failing an out-of-competition doping test, with the club claiming he accidentally took medicine meant for his wife’s consumption. They had hoped for a conditional suspension but the ban is effective from today. The club has released a statement. On the morning of October 30, Onana was feeling unwell. He wanted to take a pill to ease the discomfort. Unknowingly, however, he took Lasimac, a drug that his wife had previously been prescribed.Onana’s confusion resulted in him mistakenly taking his wife’s medicine, ultimately causing this measure to be taken by UEFA against the goalkeeper.Furthermore, the disciplinary body of the football association has stated that Onana had no intention of cheating. However, the European Football Association believes, on the basis of the applicable anti-doping rules, that an athlete has a duty at all times to ensure that no banned substances enter the body.Yes, it had fully evaded my attention until now. Bayern Munich play Hertha Berlin in the Bundesliga tonight, then fly to Qatar to play Al Ahly in the semi-finals on Sunday. Palmeiras, who only won the Copa Libertadores last week, play Tigres UANL, who beat the Korean club Ulsan in the quarter-final on Thursday. Al Ahly beat Al-Dusain - of Qatar and coached by the former Nottingham Forest manager Sabri Lamouchi - on Thursday. Just seen the FIFA Club World cup is currently going on in Qatar. That had passed me by and i thought that would have been cancelled a long time ago but then i realised FIFA..The pub banter king, Sean Dyche, speaking to PA Media, has continued his message that laughter is the best medicine. As yet, he appears not to have commented on the leveraged buyout of Burnley that David Conn helped bring to light in these pages. We’ve had some really tough times very pressurised, full of anxiety and you’ve got to diffuse that at times. It’s certainly something I’ve believed in throughout my life. The hardest things can find the funniest moments, I don’t mean crass or awkward moments or horrible ones. It’s a deadly serious moment in our world but there still has to be a moment where everyone can relax a little bit. You still have to do the job, no matter who you’re playing against. A bit of humour doesn’t go amiss. I accept humour from the players as well. It’s not a one-way street, they can have the odd flippant or funny remark. Going back to lookalikes, we did have a lookalike board, I’m not going to tell you who was on it but there were some brilliant ones which the players put on themselves. If you try to have a joke or a one-liner or fun about anything, it’s turned around on you, virtually always. It’s a shame but that’s modern life, I get that. Some managers who probably have way more humour - and I know some that are for a fact - they just go ‘there’s no point because I ended up getting it turned on me’. You’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t. Most managers, in my experience, put a straight bat on it, bat it away and try to not show the truth of who they are.Did we mention that there’s a lot of football on this weekend? That goes for sport too. Paul MacInnes has worked out the schedule. And talking of the Champions League, there’s this riddle to solve. A meeting about this is taking place today, presumably on Zoom. More as and when we get it. West Brom v Tottenham will see the José Mourinho charm offensive continue. The big game, of course, is Sunday’s showdown at Anfield. Here’s what Alex Hess had to say in our 10 things preview, with obligatory Nigel Tufnell quote. Pep Guardiola may be a tactical genius, but as Spinal Tap’s guitarist once said: “It’s such a fine line between stupid and clever.” The Manchester City manager has proven as much with his tendency to overcomplicate things in big matches. Few know this better than Jürgen Klopp, whose Liverpool team have more than once been grateful beneficiaries of Guardiola’s needlessly intricate one-off gameplans. There is no call for such complexity on Sunday. City head to Anfield having won 13 games in a row in all competitions, while their opponents have won three of their past 10, lost two on the bounce at home and kept one clean sheet this year. The Anfield crowd, which has in recent years fuelled early blitzkriegs against City, will be absent. Guardiola’s main task may be psychological rather than tactical: to ensure his players take to the pitch with the same freedom of the past two months. Or to put it in plain terms, to avoid messing with a winning formula. Public health warning: there will be no Premier League football on tonight. But titter not, lest you be tittered, it’s back tomorrow and the cold turkey will be brief. There will be aching limbs all round, and a few suspensions too after a few red cards, not all of them rescinded. So, what do we have in store? Saturday’s early game sees Aston Villa entertain Arsenal, with both teams coming off defeats in midweek. At 3pm, Burnley welcome in-form Brighton, slayers of Tottenham and Liverpool in four days. Sean Dyche, the lookalikey banter king, takes on Graham Potter, future England manager. After their *latest* 9-0, Southampton go to Newcastle, who lost to Crystal Palace on Tuesday in a game that already feels a long time ago. A London derby follows that, and it’s Fulham versus West Ham where future Hammers manager Scott E Parker takes on David Moyes, who has found the new Fellaini in Tomas Soucek. Saturday’s fun concludes with Manchester United struggling to score against Everton having used up all their goals against Southampton. Tottenham versus West Brom is Sunday’s midday meeting of the entertainers, followed by Nuno’s Wolves, another team of thrill jockeys, taking on Leicester, who recovered themselves after losing to Leeds last Sunday by beating Fulham. Then comes Liverpool versus Manchester City, a match Jürgen Klopp may be relying on an outbreak of Cityitis to have any hope of defending the title. Sunday’s late game, Sheffield United versus Chelsea, will see Thomas Tuchel trying to out-tactic Chris Wilder whose Blades have glinted a glimpse of safety. The round of matches concludes on Monday with a discussion of Argentinian literature between Marcelo Bielsa and Roy Hodgson when Leeds play Crystal Palace."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11d328110dc1f2b833145a74ccdffcc066d06287/0_123_1020_612/master/1020.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9c90e7e15e5387526f829412d859d066 1760w","title":"wall street versus the redditors the gamestop goldrush podcast","story":"When a group of amateur investors on a Reddit messageboard began buying up stock in a video games retailer it forced huge losses on major Wall Street hedge funds that had bet against it. But following a trading frenzy the stock began to fall, almost as quickly as it had risenAt the beginning of the year, not many people were paying attention to GameStop. Its business of selling video games in retail stores looked increasingly shaky as the market shifted ever more online in the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic. GameStop’s seemingly grim prospects led Wall Street hedge funds to take out big bets on the company’s share price falling further (known as short selling) but they had not reckoned with a force that was about to blow them away. Users of the Reddit messageboard WallStreetBets began grouping together to buy huge quantities of GameStop’s stock, driving the share price higher and higher and inflicting huge losses on the hedge fund titans.  Desmund Delaney tells Rachel Humphreys that as part of the Reddit community he was tipping shares in GameStop back in 2019 and took his own advice investing in the company, despite the derision of other users. But he gave up on the company last year while its share price was below $10 and cashed out. If he’d sold last week he would be sitting on half a million dollars.  Economist Dan Davies explains that while the phenomenon of an online community-driven stock market bubble feels new and exciting, it’s a story as old as the markets themselves. A group of investors egg each other on to speculatively jack up the price of shares they are holding – only for the whole thing to come crashing down. In the case of GameStop, it may have burned some incautious hedge fund managers, but the steep decline in the share price this week has proved to be a sharp lesson for amateur investors who didn’t sell up before the crash began. Are online forums a new force on Wall Street? Or are the odds still stacked too steeply against them?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6778ebdc5829aed716f96dd1543285f5f6e835ab/0_64_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=03a823152f75a23ffa9174663fabe5c4","title":"india v england first test day one live score updates","story":"And that is that. So the day ends on a sorrowful note for England, but let’s not allow it to take anything away from Joe Root, who has been superhuman on this tour. When he made 228 and 186 in Sri Lanka, it was ravenous batting against a middling attack. Today, he added another 128, in his hundredth Test, against Bumrah, Ashwin and Ishant. After spending the whole week talking the talk, he has walked the walk. And on terrestrial TV too. “An absolutely brilliant innings,” says Alastair Cook. Yes, slamming into leg stump. A great delivery, and a sad moment for Sibley, but he did so well. He gave his all, faced 286 balls, and played his part in a partnership of exactly 200.A superb yorker! This looks out, and is given, but they’re reviewing – might as well...89th over: England 263-2 (Sibley 87, Root 128) A single to each batsman off Ashwin, and that’s the 200 partnership off 62.4 overs. It’s been slow, then quick, then measured. And magnificent. 88th over: England 261-2 (Sibley 86, Root 127) Bumrah was just changing ends. He gets some lovely lift outside off, but Sibley was never planning to play a shot. He just wants to bat through the day: that hundred can wait.87th over: England 261-2 (Sibley 86, Root 127) Bumrah, despite beating Root twice in two balls, is taken off, to make way for Ashwin. He gets a moral victory too, luring Root into a thick outside edge, but it just trickles away for a single. These two batsmen have now quadrupled the score. And Root celebrates with a six! A slog-sweep, crisply done, although the effort lands him on the deck with another bout of cramp. Stuart Broad trots out with some kind of energy drink, and no doubt berates his captain for leaving him out on a pitch that’s giving the seamers some help. 86th over: England 251-2 (Sibley 85, Root 118) Root, facing Ishant, is still up to playing his favourite shot, the unforced force into the covers, though it only brings a single this time.“Aside Root’s serene majesty,” says Guy Hornsby, “we should also delight in Sibley’s obduracy here too. He had an absolute mare in Galle and rode his luck last dip but he’s been chanceless here, and has really moved well and been rock solid. It’s vital, given how big we’ll need to go here.” Rock-solid, that’s his game.85th over: England 250-2 (Sibley 85, Root 117) Root has cramp, understandably – he has said that he used to cramp up on getting to 80 in Asian Tests, so this is progress. He plays a pull at Bumrah, gets a thick bottom edge and jogs a single to bring up the 250. Five overs to get through before he has a well-earned bath.84th over: England 249-2 (Sibley 85, Root 116) Sharma to Sibley, which means quite a lot of shouldering arms. There was a danger today that thousands of kids would taste Test cricket for the first time and find that the main ingredient was Sibley leaving the ball. Root’s hundred has made sure there’s something to get excited about instead. And there’s time, just, for Sibley to join him, although he’s probably not remotel fussed. 83rd over: England 249-2 (Sibley 85, Root 116) Back comes Bumrah, and Root, light on his feet, goes deep in the crease to deflect for two. Bumrah finds his radar, gets one to hold its line outside off and beats Root, which is no mean feat at the moment. And then he does it again, with a carbon copy. He could easily have four for 39 by now, rather than just the one.82nd over: England 247-2 (Sibley 85, Root 114) Now Kohli does take the new ball, so perhaps he agrees that it was crazy not to. He hands it to Ishant, who immediately finds some tasty outswing, adding to the feeling that Jimmy Anderson could have some fun here. Root ignores that first outswinger but creams the next one through the covers. Old ball, new ball, seeing it like a football. There’s only one slip and a gully, so even if he does nick it, he may well get away with it.81st over: England 242-2 (Sibley 85, Root 109) So the new ball is due – and Kohli doesn’t take it. This is either madness or genius. Ashwin, to be fair, finds some lavish turn, though the ball merely misses Sibley’s inside edge and goes for four leg byes. There have been 57 runs off the last ten overs. John Jervis (55th over), your dream is in danger of coming true. 80th over: England 235-2 (Sibley 83, Root 108) Channel 4 are showing the highlights of a memorable innings, but Root is busy adding another one – an off-drive off the off-spinner, Sundar, which, as Mark Butcher says, anyone else would have played to mid-on with the spin. Root has 37 off his last 31 deliveries, and that’s been against a soft old ball. The new one could go either way. “England captain @root66 healthily distracting kids from homeschooling everywhere in the UK,” says Alison Mitchell on Twitter. “in his 100th Test, and in India to boot. It’s an education of its own.”79th over: England 228-2 (Sibley 83, Root 101) Kohli brings back Ashwin, presumably for one over before the new ball. It almost works as Sibley goes down the track and gets in a tangle, but the appeal is stifled.In case you’ve just joined us, here are Root’s scores in the first innings of his three Tests this year: 228, 186, 101 not out. All in Asia, all in the heat, all as captain. Stunning stuff.78th over: England 227-2 (Sibley 83, Root 100) Root drives Sundar down the ground – but there’s a fine ing stop and he only gets one, to go to 99. The good piece of fielding is followed by a bad one as Sibley sweeps and Gill lets it through his hands, and legs: a double nutmeg. Sibley calmly hands the strike back to Root, who flicks to leg to reach a hundred in his hundredth Test – and his third in three Tests this year. He takes his helmet off, gives Sibley an illicit hug, and smiles that boyish smile of his, as well he may. Say what you like about lockdown, it has landed England’s best batsman in the form of his life.77th over: England 218-2 (Sibley 76, Root 98) There’s a little corner of Sibley’s psyche that doesn’t entirely fancy this sidekick role. He cuts Shahbaz for four, then tries again, but finds the man at extra-cover. He has 12 off the last ten overs, to Root’s 34.76th over: England 214-2 (Sibley 72, Root 98) Sibley, not to be totally outshone, sweeps Sundar for four, meeting the ball almost as crisply as Root. Then he misses another sweep, prompting an appeal and a brief conference, but they don’t review because the ball pitched outside leg because Sundar is coming round the wicket. Reviewing is one of two things India have done conspicuously well today, along with keeping up the over-rate.75th over: England 209-2 (Sibley 67, Root 98) Root plays a late cut off Shahbaz – so late that it could almost be a UK government response to the coronavirus. Except that it’s beautiful.74th over: England 205-2 (Sibley 67, Root 94) Sibley brings up the 200 with a flick off Sundar, but he’s just the sidekick now. The star turn is Root, who threads it through the on side for four more, to go into the nineties. And that’s drinks, with Root in full flow and England (whisper it) on top. That said, the new ball is half an hour away, and it will only take a couple of nicks to even things up. Here’s Mike Jakeman, picking up on 9:01. “The madness in Madras Simon Wilde referred to also saw Kiran Nair make 303*,” he notes. “Has any Test triple-centurion gone on to play fewer matches than his six?” The answer, it seems, is no. But Nair is young enough to come again.73rd over: England 199-2 (Sibley 66, Root 89) Root switches his hands round and plays a superb reverse sweep for four. Shahbaz responds by going over the wicket and bowling into the rough. It’s the first day of the series and Root has already turned Kohli into Nasser Hussain in 2002, desperately ordering Ashley Giles to wheel away outside leg to keep Sachin Tendulkar quiet.72nd over: England 188-2 (Sibley 65, Root 80) A few singles off Washington Sundar, whose bowling has not been half as impressive as his name. He and Shahbaz, on this evidence, are much the same as Jack Leach and Dom Bess, and some way behind Ravi Ashwin. But it is only the first day of the match.71st over: England 185-2 (Sibley 64, Root 78) Root plays his tenth sweep, off Shahbaz, and miscues for the first time, but gets away with it as his top edge comes down in no-man’s-land at deep midwicket. Irritated with himself, he nails the next sweep, picks up four in the same direction, and passes 500 runs in Tests this winter. His scores have been 228, 1, 186, 11 and 78 not out: an extraordinary Joe, flowing like The Don. 70th over: England 178-2 (Sibley 64, Root 71) Root puts on his dancing shoes and meets a ball from Sundar on the half-volley, but only gets a single. A caption tells us that he’s played the sweep shot nine times, connecting with every one, and making 16 runs. 69th over: England 177-2 (Sibley 64, Root 70) For his other young spinner, Shahbaz, Kohli tries a pair of silly mid-offs, standing next to each other like kids in the Under-9s. In an ideal world, one of them would be making a daisy chain.68th over: England 177-2 (Sibley 64, Root 70) England have now seen off Bumrah too. Kohli brings back Washington Sundar, and Root sweeps his first ball for four to overtake Sibley. The gauntlet has been thrown down. Sundar has a leg slip and a silly square leg as Butcher calls it, but they’re not going to stop the sweep, which Root plays again, for two more.67th over: England 171-2 (Sibley 64, Root 64) Root sweeps Shahbaz to draw level again. Sure enough, Sibley darts out of his crease, but succeeds only in turning a length ball into a yorker, which he digs out. “Dom Sibley and Joe Root were both teenage prodigies,” says Gary Naylor on Twitter, “but the transition to full potential has been different – and we can see it right here, right now. A crisis for Sibley threatened his career a crisis for Root threatened his conversion rate. It takes all kinds.” A semi-colon and a quote from Fatboy Slim, all in one tweet. 66th over: England 170-2 (Sibley 64, Root 63) Bumrah tries the yorker again, but Root is equal to it. It’s followed by a bouncer, and he copes with that too, playing a careful pull for two, though there’s an inside edge a minute later. Mark Butcher is on commentary, trying to explain the World Test Championship scenario, messing it up, and doing it with such good humour that you don’t mind at all. He’s one of the best TV commentators in England, third only to Mike Atherton and Nasser Hussain.65th over: England 167-2 (Sibley 64, Root 60) Great psychology from Root, drawing level with Sibley, who wants to keep his nose in front. He goes down the track to Shahbaz not once, not twice, but three times, and the middle one brings an on-drive for four.“Third time Sibley has faced more than 200 balls,” says Rory Dollard on Twitter. “Both previous times he’s gone past 300, made a ton and England won the game.”64th over: England 163-2 (Sibley 60, Root 60) England have again seen off Ishant, who has bowled really well with nothing to show for it but economy (12-2-21-0). Back comes Bumrah, his run ever shorter, his arm ever stiffer, and Root pushes into the covers for four to bring up the hundred partnership. It’s taken 234 balls, and it was just what England needed after losing two wickets for none just before lunch.63rd over: England 159-2 (Sibley 60, Root 56) Better from Shahbaz Nadeem, who manages a maiden. Sibley has now faced 206 balls – a double Dentury. Joe Denly, eh, those were the days.“Now #seashanties are back in again,” says Miranda Jollie, “I am singing Spanish Ladies along to the cricket. ‘From Ishant to Sibley ‘tis 35 leagues’.” Ha.

If it can be done online, it can be done from virtually anywhere with an internet connection. At the same time, however, the move to remote work has revealed the value of the workplace, as many employees hanker to return to the office.In light of these two opposing trends, what might the office of the future actually look like?Elvira Muñoz Beraza, director of the master’s in strategic design of spaces at IE School of Architecture and Design, in Madrid, says that this year’s disruptions will transform offices for the better. “The pandemic has accelerated trends that were already there and has forced companies and experts to have difficult yet necessary conversations,” she says. “The office is the place for collaboration, social interaction and a sense of belonging. This implies less ‘me’ spaces and more ‘we’ spaces: the long open areas filled with inidual workstations or filled with cubicles are gone.”With inidual workstations effectively relocated to people’s kitchens and living rooms, offices are being reconfigured as places that primarily exist for teamwork and collaborative activity – albeit with strict social distancing measures in place and partitions separating different teams and departments.Architects and office planners are already busy with a raft of changes, including larger desks and layouts that make more use of stairwells to reduce the use of enclosed lifts. And, of course, there’s the ongoing drive to minimise the use of frequently touched surfaces, such as taps, door handles and buttons.Beraza is focused on how offices can evolve to meet the changing needs of a company and its employees. “I believe the design of the workplace will need to focus on a hybrid combination of physical and virtual, of inidual and collective, of internal and external actions, tasks and collaboration.”She notes the importance of supporting a hybrid form of office and remote work. “Remote working should stay, combined with physical encounters. Remote work is sustainable because it provides more choice and is more inclusive and erse. The nine-to-five office culture is gone for good.”Lewis Barker, ServiceNow’s senior manager of workplace services, EMEA, believes that, post-Covid, the distinction between “working from home” and “work” will cease to exist. “For many employees, the traditional office and desktop workspace is over. For them, work is wherever they want or need it to be, on whatever screen and digital device they prefer,” he says. “This agile, more distributed ‘anywhere, anytime’ workplace of the future will transform how companies operate.”Barker believes this flexibility will become an increasingly important factor for attracting and retaining staff. “If businesses don’t look to change, whether that’s with a hybrid model or all the way to completely remote, they will struggle to bring in the talent needed,” he says.Within the office, new technologies are being adopted to enable more rigorous safety protocols. Companies are shifting to touch-free sensor technology for handles, buttons and taps, signalling a reverse from the preponderance of pre-Covid touchscreens. Some planners are even looking at technology that will allow staff to control lifts and vending machines using their personal smartphones.“In terms of the conversations we’ve been having about safety precautions in the future,” says Barker, “it’s about trying to reduce the number of touchpoints employees have, whether that’s automatic doors, coffee machines, access card readers and things like that, to reduce any contamination generally.”Other design changes will need to take place, too. Daaf Serné, ServiceNow’s director of global real estate and workplace, suggests this will include allowing more square metres per person, as well as improving the amount of space in high traffic areas, and re-thinking how we can meet and collaborate in our offices. “One thing that will be key, is how technology will influence the physical environment. When thinking about the role that AI will play in the future workplace, it will help us predict when people are coming in and how we can optimisebetter utilise our spaces to support our employees better. When we talk about our ServiceNow products and how we would use this, reserving your seat or desk in the office will be ‘normal’,” he says.However work works right now, you can do it confidently with the ServiceNow Safe Workplace suite.

Here’s how to navigate the dos and don’tsWorkplace etiquette was a minor minefield before the pandemic. Now, in the wake of Covid-19, navigating an ever changing “new normal” of office interactions has become a major conundrum. Can you stop for a conversation in a one-way space? Should you get a colleague a cup of coffee? What can you do to make remote workers feel like fully integrated team members?There’s no pre-written rulebook for pandemic work etiquette, so let’s look at a few tips for navigating the new manners landscape.1. Keep your distanceIt’s amazing how quickly we’ve moved from an intimate, close-quarters society to one where people hug the sides of corridors upon passing another human. But good manners here are what they’ve always been. That is, you want other people to feel comfortable and at ease, so you should assume relatively strict distancing even if you are personally quite relaxed. If this seems a pain, there are some real upsides here. No more bone-crushing handshakes and no more awkward or clumsy collisions when a colleague or contact leans in for a peck on the cheek. You just waggle your elbows stupidly at each from a metre away from each other and make a joke about how weird it all is.2. Video conferencing v face-to-faceIf you are working on a hybrid or semi-remote team, there are unwritten rules of engagement. Those who are in the office can pick up on nuance and body language in a way that those who are on a video call just can’t. So it falls upon on-site employees to speak as if everyone is on a video call, taking turns and talking clearly. Resist the urge to make asides or get into rapid fire discussions with your in-person colleagues as this excludes those who are working remotely. It’s hard for remote employees to fully participate when it sounds as if they’ve called into the middle of a rugby scrum.4. If people are breaking the rules …A good rule of thumb here is to treat everyone as if they’re innocent at first. Rather than being aggressive or sarcastic you might say: “Mike, I think you forgot we’re meant to be socially distancing here.” Chances are a reminder is all it will take. However, if the person says it’s no big deal or refuses, you might say: “It makes me uncomfortable or anxious,” or “We all have to obey the rules, even if they’re a pain.” In the first case, you’re making it about their effect on you, not their behaviour and in the second, you’re making it about rules that aren’t set by either of you. Both or are non-confrontational and hard to argue with, especially the former.5. Companies can helpLewis Baker, senior workplace services manager at ServiceNow says that it really helps if companies codify the rules and explain them to staff. “We put together a Return to Workplace playbook, which explains the new workplace experience and behaviour we expect of ServiceNow employees upon return. By the time they came back in, they knew what the guidelines were.” He adds that ServiceNow also supplies some of the basics: “We provide masks. We also offer online mindfulness sessions, you know, cooking classes, nutrition advice, and ergonomic advice. We’ll help you to get set up from home and put support mechanisms in place.” Straightforward rules help people understand what is expected and reduces the risk of disagreement and conflict. Companies should also keep staff up to date as government guidelines and scientific advice changes.It truly is a weird new world of work out there. But by staying respectful and keeping it clean, we can all make it through together – apart.The ServiceNow Safe Workplace Suite offers tools for organisations to deliver the right digital experience for each phase of reopening.

Other island nations such as Tonga, in the South Pacific Ocean, have reported no infections.“To be an island in 2020 or 2021 is probably the greatest geographical gift you could have,” said Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh.So, as British cases start to fall and discussions about easing lockdown restrictions resume, are there strategies it could borrow to return it to normality?From the UK’s shores, New Zealand’s current situation looks idyllic: “After the lockdown(s), which were only required because border closure came too late, day-to-day life for most New Zealanders appears to be completely normal, and there are very few restrictions” said Matt Boyd at Adapt Research Ltd in Reefton, New Zealand, who has modelled the impacts of border closures for island nations.Even his own pre-Covid predictions about a major loss of tourism revenues if New Zealand ever closed its borders, have not entirely come to pass. Tourist operators continue to call for emergency funding, but the economic impact has been blunted by New Zealanders holidaying domestically, Boyd said: “Socially there have been family separations, people unable to return home for funerals, or see dying loved ones. But the social, economic and political consequences in New Zealand seem less than in countries dealing with ongoing community transmission.”This begs the question: would the UK now be in a similar position, had it acted earlier? The UK confirmed its first Covid-19 case on 31 January – three weeks before the virus arrived in New Zealand. “Logistically it would have meant making a decision very early on,” said Boyd.Yet, speed is of the essence. However, other countries managed it: “Taiwan and Hong Kong imposed the first measures as early as 31 December. South Korea, Thailand and Japan also responded quickly,” said Kelley Lee, professor of global health governance at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada, whose team recently reviewed 29 studies modelling the impact of travel restrictions on Covid-19 transmission. “We found that if cross-border measures are going to work, they need to be applied early on.”The British home secretary, Priti Patel, recently said she had advocated shutting the UK’s borders in March. But although a series of travel measures were introduced in 2020 – including issuing non-mandatory guidance to self-isolate for 14 days to travellers coming from designated high-risk countries – this was withdrawn on 13 March, with no further border measures in place until 8 June.Genetic analysis revealed that Sars-CoV-2 was inidually introduced well over a thousand times during early 2020 – mostly from Spain, France, and Italy. “Late February to mid March were critical,” said Prof Oliver Pybus at the University of Oxford, who led this research. “During this period, high numbers of incoming travellers from Europe coincided with large and growing epidemics in many European countries.”The result was multiple chains of transmission being initiated in parallel at different locations. This rapidly overwhelmed the UK’s existing capacity for inidual-level contact tracing. It also prevented the virus from being contained in a particular part of the country through a cordon sanitaire like in Wuhan, China. “It’s likely that the importations resulted in the early phase of epidemic growth accelerating faster than was expected,” said Pybus. “Importations mean the virus can reach less well-connected or more remote parts of the country more quickly.”The UK’s connectedness may also have put it at a disadvantage. “Like France and Germany, we’re kind of in that position of connecting Asia and the Americas and Africa as a pretty central point in the world, so we have a lot of people connecting through but also coming here,” said Andrew Tatem, professor of spatial demography and epidemiology at the University of Southampton. “That is something that governments always have to balance up, because a lot of our service industries are based on that connectivity.”Even though rapid action can buy a country time, it does not completely prevent virus from being imported – as further small outbreaks in New Zealand have shown. “Governments need to use that time to put in place and fortify domestic public health measures – notably testing and quarantine,” said Lee. “It is what governments do domestically in addition to cross-border measures that has contributed to how they’ve fared over the past year.”It may not be too late. Many British scientists would like to see the UK further tighten its borders and pursue a “zero-Covid” strategy in the coming months. “People talk about living with the virus. But what is that?” said Martin McKee, a professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine.Either we try to eliminate the virus, meaning minimising travel and maintaining lockdown restrictions until there are so few cases they can be managed through contact tracing – as New Zealand has done – or ease restrictions earlier, in the hope that the vaccine will provide a solution, McKee said. The UK government is not convinced about the need for blanket border restrictions. It is also scrambling to book tens of thousands of hotel rooms to quarantine arrivals from 33 high-risk countries on the UK travel ban list, which are due to open on 15 February.Speaking at the Commons transport select committee on Wednesday, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: “We are an island nation unlike … Australia or something which is an entire continent – and that means that we need to get medicines in, we need to get food in, we need to get our raw materials in, sometimes we have to move people around, scientists and others.However, it is a misnomer to use the term “border closure” to describe what other island nations have done. “Few countries, if any, have completely closed their borders during this pandemic,” said Lee. “Australia and New Zealand continue to have travellers and trade flowing into their countries. But they have reduced these to essential traffic, and they have then also introduced screening, testing and quarantine measures that ensure that anyone and anything entering their countries are virus-free.“The task, therefore, is to decide what is essential versus non-essential traffic. It is essential that food supplies, medicines and key workers, for example, continue to flow across borders. However non-essential travel should be discouraged.”The UK now faces a similar dilemma: “We have a choice here between opening up in the UK or being able to travel abroad,” said Sridhar. “Would you like to be able to socialise, have children at school, go to bars, watch live sports events, attend music events and get back to daily life, but at the expense of not being able to travel? Or would you like to go abroad and cross borders but live with tighter restrictions for the foreseeable future?.”Ask a New Zealander which they would choose."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a003b9e17b529aac6dd152d02e103a8203bafa5/0_66_7360_4414/master/7360.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b931fa9f0ddb94fb6cd12d77501c6c51","title":"vaccinated israeli grandparents play with grandchildren again","story":"While officials still urge caution over Covid, many older people are going out to see their family It was a sight as common as birds chirping in trees or cars idling in traffic. Nobody would do a double-take when they saw children playing with their grandparents. That was before the pandemic, when it was simply a routine image of daily life and not a potentially fatal activity.But more and more, in playgrounds across Jerusalem, a grandparent can be seen strolling along while a grandchild rushes ahead to slides and climbing frames.In this city, most older people are vaccinated against Covid-19 and are slowly emerging from nearly a year of strict isolation. While still not advised by authorities, some are cautiously returning to the thing they missed the most.“The feeling is extraordinary,” said Yoel Silver, a 67-year-old lawyer, as he pushed his granddaughter on a swing. Twelve days before, Silver had received his second shot of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine, which initial data suggests gives a high level of resistance to the disease. For months he had mostly seen his 11 grandchildren on video calls.In a different park near the Old City of Jerusalem, another Israeli grandparent, Reuven Brauner, 70, said he and his wife had not socialised with friends but decided to visit their grandchildren after being immunised.His granddaughter, aged two, toddled around while her one-year-old brother lay in a pram nearby. Not being close to the younger grandchildren over the months had been especially hard, said Brauner. “They grow up so quickly at this age.”The vaccination campaign has been the subject of intense global focus. Not only does it provide a test case for how the jabs work in the real world but it also exemplifies a highly unequal international vaccination push in which citizens of richer, more powerful nations will be first to see the benefits.While one in three Israelis has received a jab, Palestinians in the Israeli-controlled occupied territories are far behind. They are just now receiving the first batches of limited doses.Although Israel is leading the world in vaccinations, concerns remain around how much caution can be abandoned. The country is still under a lockdown, with relatively high daily infection figures.A health ministry official has advised grandparents to keep masks on and remain socially distanced from their grandchildren, warning the disease may still be transmitted by vaccinated people and keep the national infection rate high.Orli Shuruki, a 71-year-old from Jerusalem, has nine grandchildren and says she decided to get vaccinated because of them. “I felt I had enough. I couldn’t host my family. I could only see them through the window,” she said.Her middle-aged children have also been given shots, and they decided to get together for a Saturday lunch last week for the first time in months.“The grandchildren couldn’t remember when was the last time we gathered at home,” she said. “I think I had become depressed, and that is why I gained weight.”Shuruki said the family wore masks but took them off to eat, and split the tables to keep the households apart. Still, she allowed herself a brief embrace with her grandchildren.It was what the kids missed more than anything else, she said. “The hugs, only the hugs. They didn’t care about what I cooked for them, only the hugs.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4476226.1612453963!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"women s hour trinity set to elect a female provost for the first time","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGeorge Salmon, provost of Trinity College Dublin from 1888 to 1904. He was fiercely opposed to the admission of female students to the university. Photograph: Frank MillerIt’s more than a century since the former provost of Trinity College Dublin George Salmon is reputed to have said: “Over my dead body will women enter this college.”He died in 1904 – the same year Isabel Marion Weir Johnston, a young Derry woman, became the first female student to enter Trinity College Dublin. On Friday at noon the university is set to confirm that a woman will take over the role of Provost of Trinity College Dublin for the first time since it was established in 1592 by Queen Elizabeth I. An all-female shortlist of three senior academics will be officially announced which is understood to include Linda Doyle, dean of research Linda Hogan, a theologian and former vice-provost and Jane Ohlmeyer, a high-profile historian.The successful candidate will reside in one of the most prestigious addresses in Dublin – No 1 Grafton Street – with an impressive art collection including works by Jack B Yeats. The 10-year position will be accompanied by a €200,000 a year salary. To get there first, though, candidates must contend with a papal-style election process.About 800 full-time academic staff are eligible to vote and the candidates will be vying for their support during more than a dozen hustings events due to take place between now and April 7th.In normal times, the electorate gathers in Trinity’s dining hall to elect the new provost in a conclave this year, voting will take place online.The election of a woman as provost will be a milestone moment for the university, says Susan Parkes, former head of education in Trinity and editor of Danger to the Men? A History of Women in Trinity College Dublin.“It’s been a slow process which many women have contributed to in their own way over the years,” she says.Women were not regarded as equal members of the university after women were first admitted, she says.“There was no residence on campus for women. They had to be off campus by 6pm and weren’t allowed to dine in the dining hall. It continued as a male, residential community for many years,” she says.It wasn’t until the late 1960s when women were allowed to join debating societies and became eligible to be elected as fellows and scholars. Female students were also given rooms on campus for the first time.“The election of Mary Robinson as president was also an important development,” says Ms Parkes.Mrs Robinson – who was auditor of the college’s law society and became Reed Professor of Law, as well as a senator – was elected president in 1990.“It showed that women in high office were very able. We all looked up to her. It gave people confidence that women could successfully run for public office,” she adds.“Nowadays, there are plenty of women in leadership positions in the university. They are more than ready for it. If this happened 10 years ago, it would have been bigger news… it’s taken a long time.”In fact, several other colleges got there first. There have been a number of female presidents of institutes of technology in recent years, while Kerstin Mey, interim president of the University of Limerick, appointed last summer became the first woman to head up an Irish university.Daunting taskThe current provost Prof Patrick Prendergast finishes up his term of office on July 31st the in-tray facing the new provost will be daunting.Managing the disruption linked to Covid-19 will be a key priority. The college’s finances have been badly hit while there is an urgent need to improve the university experience for 18,000 students who are learning remotely.Tackling underinvestment in the college’s antiquated computer systems may be unglamorous, but many say will be key to improving efficiency and tackling bureaucracy.Readjusting the college’s position in a post-Brexit world and building bridges with European universities will also be vital at a time when much of the college’s focus in the past has been on UK and US higher education institutions.One certainty, says Ms Parkes, is the new female provost will end up breaking new ground.“It will be a boost for women academics. To think it’s really not that long ago women weren’t even allowed in the university common room. They had to keep to themselves... I sometimes say to female students to this day, be sure to get your photo beside the statue of George Salmon, just to shows how far we’ve come.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Ireland, North and South, would benefit by copying best British policiesYoung people seeking to unblock barriers to participation and engagement on climatePush for environmental regulations has alienated voters in the American Midwest"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Government and its agencies finally taking threats of storms seriously"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4476578.1612478117!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hse plans to vaccinate over 70s at large gp practices and dedicated centres","story":"Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan has warned that because of current high levels of Covid-19 we still have a substantial amount of work to do in February to \u0027stay on the track we\u0027re on\u0027.

Photograph: Colin Keegan, Collins DublinThe over-70s will be vaccinated against Covid-19 at large GP practices, primary care centres and dedicated vaccination facilities from the middle of this month under new plans being finalised by the health service.Following the decision that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines should be given to those aged over 70 where possible, rather than the more easily stored AstraZeneca product, the HSE has been working on what one source described as a “total re-tooling” of how the vaccination of older people will be handled.Under the revised plan, GPs with smaller numbers of clients would likely travel to larger practices because of the challenges in transporting the vaccines.Health officials are examining the impact this would have in areas with lower population densities and for groups such as the over-85s. It is understood that consideration is being given to how this group might travel to get inoculated and whether transport needs to be provided to ensure they get vaccinated.The plan is to begin vaccinating the over-70s from mid-February onwards. Political sources say there may be a delay of two to three weeks in covering this group due to the changes. However, they expect there will be faster progress vaccinating healthcare workers and under-70s with chronic illnesses, who can receive the AstraZeneca vaccine.The HSE told the Covid-19 vaccine taskforce on Thursday that revised vaccination plans were nearing finalisation and that delivery schedules were becoming clearer.The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) has said it believes Covid-19 case numbers are on a path of stable decline and could be as low as 200 a day by the end of this month. It said the more transmissible variant of the disease first identified in the UK now accounted for three out of every four cases here and was firmly dominant.A further 75 deaths of Covid-19 patients were reported on Thursday, bringing to 3,586 the total number of deaths in the pandemic. A further 1,318 cases of the disease were also reported as the total number of infections in the State to date passed 200,744 on Thursday.EconomyMeanwhile, Ministers and officials at a Cabinet committee meeting on the economy have heard growing concerns about the cost of providing pandemic supports at the existing levels.Two sources said the meeting was told the Government could not keep borrowing at the current rate and that fiscal constraints could kick in next year or the year after. This would mean the Government would have to find a way to move towards balancing the budget at that stage.The European Central Bank would also not be in a position to underpin the current level of borrowing by governments indefinitely, the meeting heard.Political sources have estimated that any tapering off of pandemic supports would be likely to happen towards the end of the summer as the need for restrictions eases, though a date has not been put on this.The committee is also believed to have discussed a new support for businesses which have had to close or are experiencing sharply restricted activity due to the restrictions.The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) was introduced in the budget to help companies that had to close their doors to customers, offering them up to €5,000 a week.

Greene expressed regret for some of her recent incendiary remarks but failed to apologize for supporting violence against Democrats.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Marjorie Taylor Greene’s  conduct was the subject of heated debate at a private Republican party meeting on Wednesday. Photograph: Alex WongGetty The US House of Representatives voted on Thursday night to remove controversial Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committee positions after a rancorous debate within the Republican party about the behaviour of the recently elected member. The Democrat-controlled House voted by 230-199 to remove Ms Greene from the budget and education committees. Eleven Republicans joined with all Democrats in voting to censure the Georgia representative – one more than the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach former president Donald Trump last month. The vote took place after Republicans declined to strip Ms Greene of her committee assignments, despite House minority leader Kevin McCarthy condemning her previous statements.“Past comments from and endorsed by Marjorie Taylor Greene on school shootings, political violence and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories do not represent the values or beliefs of the House Republican conference,” Mr McCarthy said in a statement on the eve of the vote. “I condemn those comments unequivocally.”But he accused Democrats of “raising the temperature” and exercising a “partisan power grab” by trying to undermine the committee assignments of another party.Ms Greene, a prominent supporter of the radical QAnon group who was elected in Georgia in November’s elections, has come under fire for her support of conspiracy theories, including the notion that the September 11th attacks did not take place and that several mass school shootings were staged.Her conduct was the subject of heated debate at a private Republican party meeting on Wednesday. During that meeting, House Republicans also voted by secret ballot to keep the third-ranking Republican, Liz Cheney, in her leadership position. The Wyoming representative has suffered a backlash from the pro-Trump wing of the party over her vote to impeach the former president last month. But ultimately Ms Cheney won the vote of confidence by 145 to 61.Speaking in the House ahead of Thursday’s vote, Ms Greene addressed some of her past comments, stating that “school shootings are absolutely real”, and the September 11th terrorist attacks “absolutely happened”. But she said that Democrats want to “crucify me in the public square for words that I said a few years ago”.However, in a statement, Mr Trump’s lawyers dismissed the letter as a “publicity stunt”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Travel latest news: UK planning vaccine passports for foreign holidaysHas the Royal Navy got enough ships?National service – should it be brought back?India protests: how Rihanna brought attention to the plight of farmersThis is what hotel quarantine in the UK will be like UK weather: Drivers trapped in snowdrifts in Scotland with big freeze coming to whole of UKAlexei Navalny appears in court facing criminal libel case criticised as \u0026#39fabrication\u0026#39High-profile Aung Sang Suu Kyi aide arrested as hundreds join protest in Myanmar after coupUrsula von der Leyen accidentally makes the case for Brexit as she tries to explain EU vaccine delays\u0026#39Who cares!\u0026#39 Donald Trump quits Screen Actors Guild after facing disciplinary action for Capitol riotGosport hospital victims need \u0026#39Hillsborough-style\u0026#39 inquests to examine drug misuse, relatives sayExiting lockdown: How the goalposts have shifted since January 4You\u0026#39ll never walk alone: How Captain Sir Tom Moore captured our hearts in the hardest of times \u0026#39We were blessed to have Captain Tom\u0026#39 -  readers on the week\u0026#39s biggest talking pointsJeffrey Epstein fund abruptly suspends payouts to victimsBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"beauty not enough venice facing long recovery covid","story":"For more than 300 years, its gilded rooms and elaborate décor and have welcomed everyone from Casanova and his lovers to Charlie Chaplin, Coco Chanel and Clint Eastwood.The elegant, bejewelled masks that would normally be seen around the city, worn by partygoers dressed in 18th century cloaks and gowns, have been replaced by the ubiquitous surgical masks worn scrupulously by Venetians.We hope to open in late spring, said the Florian\u0027s Mr Marzari.

Buoyant but not arrogant, his urbane tones expressed a winning mix of gratitude and modesty, even though he could have been forgiven for treating the outing as a latter-day version of an ancient Roman triumph.The only thing lacking, in the calm of the sparsely populated chamber, were charioteers and plebeian hordes cheering the arrival of the Emperor – sorry, Minister for Vaccine Deployment – as he rejoiced in the mass mobilisation and surging inoculation rates.Almost nine out of 10 of the over-75s had been jabbed, he cried, plus more than half of 70-somethings. He reeled off a list of sites repurposed for vaccinations: a Worcester church, “Selhurst Park, home of Crystal Palace”, a fire station in Basingstoke.As he surveyed the breadth of his domain, the minister almost wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer – or old people to vaccinate.Mr Zahawi congratulated each and every inidual who could possibly have had the slightest hand in the rollout. Then he gracefully accepted his colleagues’ repeated tributes to the NHS, like a succession of laurel wreaths, and humbly scorned personal compliments.“I stand on the shoulders of heroes,” he added with studied modesty, in the manner of Caesar refusing the crown. “It is the NHS family and volunteers and the Army that are doing the real heavy lifting in this deployment.”He evidently relished the chance to big up all examples of unaccustomed unity among his fellow MPs, confessing himself, “heartened to see colleagues from all sides of the House coming together to encourage take-up in minority ethnic communities. “MPs don’t agree all the time but on taking the vaccination we do!”True, occasional resistance came from the backbench ranks – usually MPs from less-vaccinated constituencies requesting some emergency deployment to their front lines. For the most part, the minister met these requests with aggressive politeness, though when Kirsty Blackman of the SNP asked about vaccinating the rest of the world, he flatly contradicted her expansionary aims. “We are nowhere near ready to make that offer.”Despite the legions of good tidings, he warned solemnly, deaths and infection rates remained “alarmingly high”.Mark Harper, of the Covid recovery group, asked: “Does the minister agree with me that once the first nine groups have been vaccinated, that would be the right time for all restrictions to be relaxed?”Mr Zahawi’s “very gradually”, plus a heavy hint that lockdown rules would persist until all over-50s had been inoculated, was not entirely satisfactory to Mr Harper.For all the enthusiastic plaudits, the minister would doubtless acknowledge the truth of Ovid’s dictum: “There is no such thing as pure pleasure some anxiety always goes with it.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"starmers going need do better","story":"Before we all start writing off Keir Starmer as a future prime minister, it might be worth reminding ourselves that there is a reason that leader of the opposition is described as the toughest job in UK politics. Having said that, yesterday was not a good day for the Labour leader, arguably his worst since taking office last spring. He’s going to have to do better. The question being asked by his supporters and detractors is: can he?There is a difference between a lie and an inadvertent false statement. As a nervous minister at my very first oral questions in 2006, I became flustered and wrongly stated that the new East Coast Mainline franchise was worth £2.1 billion to the Department for Transport. It wasn’t the correct figure was £1.2 billion. But no one accused me of lying.At Prime Minister’s Questions in the Commons yesterday, Starmer also was guilty of the latter, not the former. He made a mistake, probably because he had over-rehearsed the answer he planned to give when Boris Johnson posed the much-anticipated question.  Except that the prime minister didn’t ask the expected question but an important variation of it. Instead of accusing Starmer personally of supporting Britain’s involvement in the EU’s Covid vaccine approval process, he accused the Labour leader – correctly – of having supported Britain’s continued membership of the European Medicines Agency, which happens to have responsibility for approval of vaccines.Starmer ploughed ahead with his rehearsed answer anyway and denied Johnson’s accusation. Had he listened more intently – shall we say, forensically? – he may have been able to avoid the bear trap set by Johnson. Instead he had to issue a humiliating apology afterwards. And the difference between one thing and the other, between membership of the EMA and support for Britain’s participation in the Covid vaccine approval process, was by then lost on a viewing public bored with the finer details. It was an emphatic win for Johnson and a day that will be preferred to be forgotten by Starmer and his office.One poor PMQs performance doesn’t write a leader’s obituary. Even Tony Blair had his off days across the despatch box from then prime minister John Major: remember when Blair was humiliated by Major over the Labour leader’s and Harriet Harman’s decision not to send their children to state comprehensives? Blair recovered his esteem in voters’ eyes and his mojo, and the rest is history. Can Starmer do the same?Yes, he can, but that doesn’t mean he will. Never in Labour’s history has a new leader been burdened with such a level of expectation and, at the same time, such a large number of detractors in his own party. That is a consequence of the last six years of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, the sense of betrayal still felt by the former leader’s fans and the changes that Starmer has wrought since taking over. All Labour leaders have had their critics but Starmer has repeatedly poked the nest of vipers at a time when the viper population is still at a historically high level.He will not be challenged for the leadership, nor will he resign voluntarily. Starmer will lead his party into the next general election. There is no appetite whatever for a new contest and Starmer would easily win any vote of confidence among his own MPs, were one to be held (which it won’t be). Which makes the constant sniping on social media from members who will never be reconciled to Corbyn’s departure all the more damaging. The problem for Labour is that some of that sniping has some justification.Yesterday was a low point but low points are most damaging when they merely confirm suspicions among some that a particular inidual isn’t up to the job, that he was always going to fall on his face and it might as well be now as later. Again, this is probably unfair. Starmer will be as tough on himself after his PMQs disaster as anyone else could be, and he won’t repeat this particular mistake. Still, the nagging doubt in many minds that Starmer has not been the inspiring, exciting figure the party needs right now will have been dangerously reinforced by yesterday’s events.As I have written here more than once, the opportunity for a new leader to define himself to his audience is a relatively narrow window. Voters tend to make up their minds about politicians within a very short period of their arriving on the national scene. By the time Blair had his little mishap at the dispatch box over parental choice on schools, he had already established his reputation as a prime minister in waiting. Starmer is in not such an enviable position. While his window of opportunity may be slightly extended until after the Covid emergency has passed, he is nevertheless running out of time, as all leaders do. When the music stops, he must sit on whichever chair is available and accept the judgment of the people. If that were to happen today, the verdict would be that Starmer is a good, decent, sensible chap who used to be a lawyer. That’s all very well, and an improvement on his predecessor, but it won’t be enough to propel him and his party into Downing Street. So he needs more time to define himself, he needs to keep winding up that gramophone handle to keep the music playing just a little bit longer. And he needs to hope that the voters won’t get bored of him while they’re waiting.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk past second wave peak numbers show","story":"I think there could well be a case for opening schools sooner – I particularly think schools for children under 11 years of age, where the evidence that they contribute to the spread of the epidemic in the wider population is a lot lower, he told The World at One.I would certainly hope to see schools, and particularly junior schools, opening relatively soon.A handover delay does not always mean a patient has waited in the ambulance.

Before the Coronavirus lockdowns the playground had been feeding children and parents daily. “We’d always have the slow cooker going, especially in the winter, always a stew or a soup, remembers Kylie.Our approach is always very informal, easy access, the children and their parents would know they could help themselves whenever they liked. People then felt secure enough to kind of say ‘I’m struggling this month’ and we could put a little box together for them.”  Although PYC’s kitchens have had to close during lockdowns, they’ve been providing food parcels to families across Portsmouth.Holly Easlick, Health Development Officer for the council, tells us how FareShare – the UK’s largest food redistribution charity – helped: “During the first lockdown FareShare were able to deliver us more food than ever so we were able to get it out to the families who needed it. Kylie stresses how vital this contact with vulnerable families is: “With Covid-, the food was a big thing to help us continue our interaction with the families. Families that struggle with food provision, there are people truly in need.” She adds: “Itaposs also about that weekly interaction. A lot of our families struggle with mental health, so that idea that they knew they could come down every week and get a food package, and also see us, talk to us was one of the most important things.Even though it was just kind of over the gate, we were able to have a conversation and it was a way in to seethere were other ways they were struggling and we could support them.”  FareShare is a network of  independent organisations with more than  warehouses right across the UK. The charity takes food that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors, short shelf le or over production, and redistribute it through a network of , frontline organisations.The food FareShare redistributes is nourishing and fresh – the same as the food you’d eat at home. Homeless hostels, school breakfast clubs, domestic violence refuges, older people’s lunch clubs, food banks and hospices all depend on FareShare’s help. Ninety per cent of these charities have seen demand reach crisis levels since the pandemic started, and they’re preparing for even more people to find themselves in need this winter. Over the coming months, FareShare will also be delivering food to night shelters and school holiday projects to reach even more people who are struggling. This winter Barclays is working with FareShare to help raise vital funds. With approximately .m people in the UK currently living in food poverty, the amount of food that’s currently wasted is shocking. It’s estimated that a third of all food produced is wasted, at a cost of £b.  FareShare is committed to ensuring that food that would otherwise be wasted gets redistributed with frontline charities and community groups. Barclaysapos £m Covid- Community Aid Package was established to help charities continue to carry out the vital work they do. It’s pledging support to organisations that are helping people affected by the crisis. To support this peak in winter demand, Barclays is pledging to donate £ for every £ you donate to FareShare through the link or text number below, up to £m, until  February.

SAGE’s Andrew Hayward said the inoculation programme offered a key to easing the lockdown. Figures tonight showed ,, people have received first doses. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “Today we passed the threshold of one in five of the population who have been jabbed already.” The UK remains on track to complete jabs of the top four priority groups by February , he added. Coronavirus cases continued to fall, with , recorded – down % on a rolling seven-day average. And , Covid- patients were admitted to hospital, down %. The UK death toll rose by , down %, to ,. Prof Hayward, professor of ­infectious disease epidemiology and inclusion health research at University College London, believed the increase in vaccinations will plot a path out of the shutdown. He said: “Once the most ­vulnerable people, particularly those over- and those with chronic illnesses, are ­vaccinated then yes, I think we can see a signicantto normality. “I think what we’ll see is a phased opening up as vaccination levels increase. Then we’ll be more or less back to normal for the summer, I would imagine.”  Pressure is mounting on Boris Johnson to publish a lockdown exit plan. The PM has vowed to outline a strategy in the week beginning February .Schools will reopen first, with face-to-face lessons in England due to resume from March .

An “ally” of Mr Sunak quoted by the Daily ­ said: “Rishi remains where he has been throughout the pandemic – he is pro-opening as quickly and as safely as possible. This needs to be the last time that we do this.” Labour said the reported claims, less than a month before the Budget, were “so ­irresponsible”.Shadow Public Health Minister Alex Norris said Mr Sunak’s ­“disastrous ­decision to block public health ­measures [last year] helped give Britain the worst death toll in Europe and the worst recession of any major economy”. Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson tweeted: “You can’t protect the economy during a pandemic unless you protect public health.” However, a source close to the Chancellor said they were ­“absolutely not things he would say”.  Tory MP Mark Harper, chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of lockdown-sceptic Conservatives, claimed curbs could be lted by the end of May. He said: “Back-of-the-envelope calculations based on two million doses a week, you could get the top nine groups first doses, and top four groups second doses, all done by the end of May.” Mr Johnson’s spokesman said: “It remains the PM’s view we want to start easing lockdown restrictions and we are keen to do that from March .” NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson warned services were still at “full stretch” and cautioned against relaxing measures too early, adding “the NHS has barely crested the peak”. Prof Helen Rees, of the World Health Organisation’s emergency committee for Covid, believed masks and social distancing will have to continue.

Charity West London Welcomehas shared pictures of the aposairline-likeapos meals provided to people living in emergency hotel accommodation. One appalling dinner included mash, peas and a bag of crisps while another consisted of congealed noodles. The charity claims families awaiting decisions on their asylum for months arenapost even allowed to use microwaves to heat food up and have to resort to boiling eggs in kettles. The Home Office has given a number of its contracts to manage temporary hotels housing asylum-seekers to the same firm running the Napier Barracks in Folkestone, Kent, that has been hit by a fire and a Covid- outbreak. Clearsprings Ready Homes was given a budget of £ per person for three meals a day, WLW claims, with the charity comparing the food to the free school meals scandal. A Labour MP has branded the food degrading and has written to Home Secretary Priti Patel in protest at the callous treatment. A Home Office spokesperson said: As required by law, we provide asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute with free, fully furnished accommodation and cover their utility costs.They are provided with a choice of three meals a day in line with NHS nutrition guidelines, as well as access to fresh fruit and drinking water all day. What do you think  Share your views in the comments below...  Asylum-seekers are legally barred from finding work or accessing benefits, which could allow them make their own food in the hotels. But they have also been banned from using the hotelsapos kitchens, including microwaves, and were forced to toss out donated ready-meals they could not cook, charityaposs director Joanne MacInnes told the Mirror. Pictures of the unimpressive meals shared by the charity include a stew covered in sweetcorn that was given to a seven-year-old for lunch. Another picture of a packaged chicken burger was criticised for its ‘astonishing’ list of highly-processed ingredients.One tweet showing picture of a packaged dinner roll said: The adult’s meal is a cold patty that they’re unable to heat up given that they have no access to any cooking facilities whatsoever. “Imagine never being able to warm up your food ” Ms MacInnes claimed asylum-seekers in London hotels her charity was helping were left boiling donated eggs and pot noodles in their roomsapos kettles. Clearsprings has had a Home Office contract to run accommodation services across London, Englandaposs South and the Wales regions since . The charity has been fielding complaints from asylum-seekers around the capital - some of whom have lived in the hotels since last June. Their allegations include being given half-heated chicken they are afraid to eat in case of food poisoning.  The charity says a number of asylum-seekers have shown them doctoraposs notes saying the food is making them sick due to a lack of nutrition, also alleging they were only given only three pieces of fruit a week per person and never any salad. Asylum-seekers able to find a way into independent accommodation are given £ a week for living costs by the Home Office but those in the temporary accommodation are given just £ a week, the charity said. WLW is calling for the hotel food supplies to be overhauled, and for the employment ban and aposno recourse to public fundsapos policies to be scrapped for asylum-seekers. Ms MacInnes said people fleeing war and persecution deserved a better welcome to Britain. “These are some of the most vulnerable people in society who arrive here with trauma and PTSD, she said. The meals they were being served were not nutritious and left people hungry, she added.  “There’s never been salad, there’s never been anything fresh or crunchy. We’ve not seen that in a single meal, she said. They average around three pieces of fruit a week - always bananas or oranges - that’s the only fresh food they are given. The point is people have been in these hotels for up to eight months and this is what they are eating.” Clearsprings has been criticised recently over conditions at Napier Barracks, which was hit by a mass Covid- outbreak last month. A fire at the facility last week followed protests by asylum-seekers at the conditions there. The incident led Ms Patel to accuse asylum-seekers of setting the fire, in a statement claiming the aposshocking scenesapos showed they were aposnot grateful aposfor British taxpayersapos hospitality. Hammersmith Labour MP Andy Slaughter has written to the Home Secretary, demanding an explanation and branding the meals pictured by the charity appalling and degrading.  He sought answers on costs and urged urgent checks to the nutritional quality of the disgraceful food being served. Mr Slaughter said: “They can’t rely on takeaways as they don’t have any means… it’s clearly an issuethey are being given food that needs to be heated up and they’re not allowed to do that. It’s an expression of the callousness of this government.” He accused the Home Secretary of permitting poor conditions as part of the Tories’ ‘hostile environment’ policy. Mr Slaughter said: “It’s asthere are people in the Home Office deciding new ways to be nasty to asylum-seekers, as a part of Patel’s strategy to put a stop people from coming here to claim asylum.” "},{"url":null,"title":"captain sir tom moore caught","story":"NewsSignicant portion of Covid patients at Captain Tom NHS Trust caught virus at hospitalBedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which cared for Captain Sir Tom Moore before his death, released a report showing their fight against the “second surge”mirrorShareCommentsByLouie Smith:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsCaptain Sir Tom Moore, who inspired the nation during the first lockdown \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The report states: “The highly transmissible nature of the circulating mutant virus and the inability to isolate patients in single rooms combined with infections in staff and asymptomatic carriage resulted in high numbers of nosocomial [acquired in hospital] infections.”Have you been affected by coronavirus  Let us know in the comments  It also emerged that “a number” of patients fell ill with Covid despite being “medically fit” for discharge. The report added: “A signicant additional factor was theof stay for many patients who were medically fit for discharge but were unable toto their place of residence.” Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is in charge of Bedford Hospital and Luton and Dunstable University Hospital.  Capt Sir Tom was admitted to Bedford Hospital on January  and diagnosed with pneumonia. He was discharged on January  but tested positive for coronavirus the same day. By January  he had been ed to the same hospital to receive treatment to help him breathe.  Capt Sir Tom, who raised over £ million for the NHS, passed away aged  on Tuesday. On Wednesday the NHS Trust issued a report from its board of directors. They revealed that their hospitals saw a “steep rise” in Covid cases during November and December. On January ,  per cent of adult beds at Bedford Hospital were occupied by Covid- patients. The report adds: “A signicant proportion of cases in the second surge were detected + days following admission, indicating infection was due to acquisition in the hospital.”  It emerged that between October and December last year there were “six incidents of potentially avoidable” Covid infections within the Trust. The data also shows that hundreds of staff contracted the virus in January.

An average of , new symptomatic cases are being reported every day in the UK - down from , at the start of the year. The figures are from the Zoe Covid Symptom Study UK Infection Survey app, which tracks around one million Britsapos symptoms. The app identied Dorset, Bournemouth, Christchurch, Poole, London and Liverpool as the highest risk areas in the UK. Professor Tim Spector OBE, lead scientist for the Zoe app, said the number of new cases is now the same as when the UK left lockdown at the end of November. He added: “We are making good progress against this virus, with  million vaccinations done and cases down by % since the peak at the beginning of the year. On top of that, we are also seeing hospital admissions from Covid drop too. But it’s not the time for hesitancy. We’re now at the same levels of new cases we were when we came out of lockdown at the end of November, with the dference being our NHS is overstretched and death rates are still high.  The King’s College London genetic epidemiology expert said vaccines will take effect in the next few weeks, driving cases down. He added: If as hoped these trends continue, I believe we should now be looking at getting children back into the classrooms sooner, so vaccinating teachers would be my next priority.” There are currently , cases per , people in Dorset, Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole. This compares with  per , in London and  per , in Liverpool. Data from the app shows the R number - the rate of infection - in England, Wales and Scotland is ., meaning the epidemic is shrinking.

Rather than following the approach used by Prince Charles and Princess Diana, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Sussexes did things their own way - keeping the location to themselves.The Daily Mailaposs Rebecca English claims that Harry became morbidly obsessed with keeping the information completely private, but many fans supported their decision. Reflecting on the time, she writes: Behind the scenes, matters were so fraught that more than one official — as I know from personal experience — was reduced to tears of frustration and despair.  The secrecy surrounding Archieaposs birth has become the topic of conversation again after it was revealed that just weeks after his birth Meghan and Harry changed their names on his birth certicate.It emerged that aposRachel Meghanapos, her first and middle names, were removed from her sonaposs certicate a month after giving birth. In its place, the document listed Archieaposs mum as the more formal aposHer Royal Highness the Duchess of Sussex.apos  It has caused a baffling row, with the couple claiming the decision came from Buckingham Palace while insiders say thataposs unlikely.Meghan and Harry released a strongly worded statement on the issue, saying: This was not requested by Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex nor by The Duke of Sussex. To see this UK tabloid and their carnival of so-called “experts” choose to deceptively whip this into a calculated family “snub” and suggest that she would oddly want to be nameless on her child’s birth certicate, or any other legal document, would be laughable were it not offensive. ‘There’s a lot going on in the world let’s focus on that rather than creating clickbait. Royal sources have revealed this has been met with a sense of “bewilderment” in the Palace. One royal source claimed that Meghan ordered her staff to make the change to Archieaposs birth certicate in order to to fall in line with amendments sheaposd already made to her passport. In short, Meghan already stylised herself as aposHRH The Duchess of Sussexapos, dropping her given names - and wanted some form of continuity.

But rewind two years and Kate feared she’d be left a widow at  bringing up their little boy alone, after their world fell apart when husband Phil was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Determined not to give up their dream of expanding their family, just three days after Phil’s diagnosis, he had his sperm frozen before starting chemotherapy. And that act of hope in the most devastating week of the couple’s le resulted in daughter Autumn - their “light at the end of the tunnel” – born on October , . Phil is now recovering well and the couple feel blessed they’ve got a second chance of happiness. “Our little girl is a symbol of hope and new beginnings for us as a growing family,” said Kate, , from Surrey. “It’s amazing knowing that Autumn was conceived with sperm frozen in the week her daddy was diagnosed with a brain tumour. After everything we’ve been through, for the first time in years we’re excited about le and our future looks bright.” Autumn’s birth was even more poignant as Kate had suffered six miscarriages trying to give Austin, now four – who was conceived in the couple’s first IVF attempt – the precious gt of a sibling. She lost three babies before Phil’s diagnosis and three while he was going through treatment using frozen embryos from treatment the first time round with Austin. “It was an emotional rollercoaster,” said Kate. “Phil was undergoing radiotherapy while I was having injections to stimulate my egg production. “I had three miscarriages over six months during his treatment, the first at six-and-half weeks and the other two at five weeks.” The couple decided to give having another baby “one final go” using the sperm Phil, , had frozen in the same week doctors told him he had a brain tumour.The couple’s ordeal started in November  when Phil was diagnosed with a brain tumour after suffering severe headaches, dizziness and tingling and numbness on his left-hand side. Doctors put the symptoms down to a sinus infection and then vertigo. Phil’s headaches intensied and sometimes he’d have to go to bed because he was in so much pain and nauseous. After five months, he saw a private GP through work and was referred for a scan, which revealed a large tumour spanning both hemispheres of his brain. Phil received the devastating news on his own as he hadn’t spotted the consultant’s email that they’d found an “anomaly” on his brain, and to bring someone with him. “He’d had an early appointment before work and I was woken up at am by the phone ringing,” said Kate. “Phil said, ‘It’s not good news, I’ve got a lump in my head that shouldn’t be there.’ “I think I stopped breathing. I was cuddled up with Austin and just couldn’t take in his words. He was a fit, healthy -year-old, brain tumours weren’t even on our radar. “The doctor told him to go home. On the train, Phil was on the phone to me and we were both crying. I went to meet him at the station with Austin and we clung to each other.” Kate couldn’t help herself fearing the worst. “My first thought was, ‘I’m going to be a widow at ,” she said. “Austin was only two and I was convinced Phil wouldn’t see him grow up and that we’d never have any more children. One minute le was normal, the next it was scary and unknown.”  Two days later, the couple went to see Phil’s consultant who broke the news he thought Phil’s tumour was cancerous. “We were told that Phil had to have surgery soon or he could die,” said Kate. “My mind went spiralling into a dark place as I thought we were going to lose him imminently. “Phil was so shocked he nearly got sick. “Then I asked about freezing Phil’s sperm as it was so important to both of us to have another child. “On the way home on the train everyone was enjoying their night out while he was white as a sheet and I was hysterical. “Back at home, I was straight on google and read that Phil’s prognosis may be  months, which made me feel even worse.” They coped by going into practical mode. “Phil dealt with our finances and I had a crash course in where everything was,” said Kate. “We didn’t have wills and did those, too. “Everything was sorted out in four days flat before Phil’s surgery.” Austin was only two when Phil was diagnosed but the couple were open as possible with him. “We told him, ‘Daddy has a poorly head’ and that he was having treatment to make him better,” said Kate.

The sheet was discovered by Rosa Beckerton’s husband Peter, , while he was refurbishing an old piece of furniture for a client. It is dated February , , and appears to be written by an -year-old girl imagining the state of the world in . She correctly predicts a huge sht in technology and even forecasts the Zoom revolution. Describing her husband’shome from work she writes: “’Hello dear,’ he said to me. ‘I’ve just got to ring up my friend on the telephone’.What do you think about the schoolgirlaposs predictions  Let us know in the comments“’Well you’d better tidy yourself up a bit,’ I said. “In  the telephone was a square box thing with a resiver [sic] on top of it. “But now it is still a resiver [sic], but you can see the people you are talking to, for there is a screen where you can see the people. It is a bit like a television.” Upholsterer Peter found the note stuffed down the back of a sofa which was sent to him for restoration after being bought second-hand.  Rosa, , from Peterborough, Cambs., decided to make the it public in case the author, who would now be aged around , is still alive. She said: “When my husband showed it to me I couldn’t believe it. I thought oh my god, look at this. “It was just so interesting, because looking at it today she’s got a lot of her predictions kind of right - but in her childish innocent way she thought it would all happen in ten years.  “I just wanted to share it in the hopes that maybe the author might see it and recognise it. “My husband has found all sorts of rubbish down the side of sofas and furniture before - but never anything as interesting as this.” The letter is unnamed but comes complete with a teacher’s corrections and comments in red pen - including the verdict ‘Good’.  It begins: “The year is , the time is half-past moon dust. Here I am twenty-one years of age, sitting in a cushion of air. “I remember when I was  years old and I was at school, things have changed since then. “For instance, the television has changed. “In  it was a square box with knobs in front of it. Now it is a big screen with knobs on your chair arm to switch it on and off.” The schoolgirl imagines that she is a married bank worker. She says in times past she would have “prepared tea” ready for her husband to come home. But she adds: “All we have is a piece of chewing gum to eat. You may think that we have not enough to eat but you are wrong, because this piece of chewing gum is food.

Colouring pens, biros, paper, glue sticks, hand sanitiser and folders were among items delivered to Cubitt Town Junior School on the Isle of Dogs in East London. Head teacher Robyn Bruce told how the stock was “vital” for younger children home learning in deprived areas, many of who do not have access to the basics. The Mirror, in a joint appeal with the National Education Union , is urging readers and firms to dig deep to help kids struggling to learn at home.Tell us your thoughts on the Help a Child to Learn campaign in the comments belowSchool mum Khadija Khatun, , lives on the th floor of a tower block with her husband and five children - aged , , ,  and . As she was handed items from the delivery, she told the Mirror: “It’s really hard at home. “The school gave us a computer, and that’s great, but we also need other things which we have to go and buy.  “We really need scissors, glue, paper and pens and this will be really useful for us, so I’m very grateful for it. “Sometimes shops I go to have run out of stock and we just don’t have enough to go around. “My  and -year-olds need this kind of equipment more, and we’re really thankful for it.  “My husband is furloughed at the moment and we find out in Aprilhe will go back to work.” Year  key worker and vulnerable children at the school were delighted to get their hands on the delivery. Mid-way through a science lesson Arsenal fan Bradie Adu-Yeboah, , told us: “It’s great because it’s all new.  “I’ll use it for all the work I have to do at home. “I have a colouring book so I will definitely be using the colouring pens.” His classmate Che’nai Quatromini, also , said: “I’m doing a moon project at home but I don’t have enough paper so I can use this for my background.  “I can also colour it in and use it for the moon. It will be really helpful.” This week’s delivery was a sample of what schools will have sent to them. Schools will get vouchers for either £, £, or £,, depending on their need. So far, there are  schools due to receive vouchers. Some £, has so far been raised in addition to the NEU’s £ million donation when we jointly launched the campaign last week.  At Cubitt Town Junior School, which also has an infants’ school attached to it, parents collect packages each Friday to help with home learning. The items bought with the vouchers will help create more packs for the children working from home and for those in need. Ms Bruce said: “The lower down the age groups you go, the more this kind of equipment is needed.  “Having paper, pens, scissors, and glue sticks at home is so important - and people don’t realise that parents sometimes don’t have them. “We had a parent whose child filled their homework in with a felt tip, and we could barely read it. I spoke to them and they did not have a pen at home. “It’s something that is taken for granted. “Of course they need computers and iPads and online learning is important, but it’s deeper than that.  “We’ve got families where there are lots of children in one small place and just feeding them is a struggle - and then we’re asking them to buy pens and paper and glue as well. “That’s why these deliveries will make such a dference and we thank the Mirror and the NEU for all they’re doing. “We also want pupils to have time away from the screen and to be creative. “The ide between those children who are from families which have this equipment and those from families who don’t will continue to grow unless we can ensure they all have the right means to learn.  “So much of our budget is being used to help pupils through the pandemic and there will be all sorts of extras to pay for once they , so these packages help us a lot,” said Ms Bruce. Kevin Courtney, Joint General Secretary of the NEU, said: “It is fantastic that Cubitt Town Junior School will benefit from the Help a Child to Learn campaign.

From Saturday warnings for snow and ice will cover theof Britain from midday up to midnight on Sunday. By next week, temperatures will be struggling to get much above C in a number of areas, with some regions such as the Pennines and high parts of Scotland seeing several degrees below that. Birmingham faces lows of minus C by Tuesday morning, while a strong easterly wind will make it feel many degrees below freezing in some parts, according to Met Office forecaster Steven Keates.  He said it will be really unpleasant to be outdoors, adding: If you do have to go outside there are lots of layers required I think. Mr Keates said the south will see a marked drop in temperatures across Saturday and Sunday, with some parts possibly seeing as much as -cm of snow. He added: Enough snow is on the cards I think to cause potentially quite a bit of disruption in the south east of England through Sunday, and potentially very early next week as well.

Angela Speed, spokeswoman for the Humane Society, said many of the animals have needed medical attention. “Pythons, rats and mice need really specialized habitats in order to be well cared for, things like aquariums and heat lamps,” she added. “Our staff is really focused on upgrading their habitats from plastic Rubbermaid containers to aquariums and proper housing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman 22 shares transformation after","story":"NewsWoman, , shares transformation after losing all her teeth to six-year drug addictionFaith Hill, from Missouri in the US, has shared her honest videos on TikTok in order to educate others about the dangers of substance abuse and drug addictionmirrorShareBySimon GreenVideo News EditorDanya BazaraaSenior News Reporter:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video former-drug-addict-makes-amazing-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

victory over Tottenham on New Year#s Eve .Days later he was dead, leaving a we behind, having recently been married.Munro#s name is largely forgotten in Dundee but he is a legend in Swindon.Swindon Town fan James Turner is heading up a group of enthusiasts looking to raise money to restore his grave and trace any surviving relatives.Munro was Swindon#s first paid captain.Thousands of people lined the streets to pay their respects when he was laid to rest at the age of just  in .Born in January , Munro quickly rose from junior to senior circles and played for Our Boys before he joined Strathmore at the age of .Munro played alongside Billy Dickson who won his only Scotland cap while with Strathmore when he scored four goals on his debut against Ireland.Munro played on the outside-left or outside-right for Strathmore.He would follow Dickson to England, signing for Bolton in  before a move to Burton Swts in .Munro then joined Swindon in  as centre-half and was given the captaincy after the club turned professional.He was earning  shillings a week.Munro was ft  inches tall and weighed -and-a-half stone but was described as #lion-hearted# with a #never-say-die# attitude despite his stature.He played  games for Swindon, scoring  goals, and won Southern League representative honours.#I initially became aware of Munro after reading a book by local Swindon Town historian Paul Plowman,# said Mr Turner.#Paul gave a detailed account of James Munro#s playing career as well as a general overview of his death which I followed up with my own research.#It was quite possible playing in the cold was a contributory factor to his death.#We may never know his health generally before the match and it was likely that evenhe felt unwell he could have shrugged it off with a tot of whisky.#Andhe was of the character that was at his best when the chips were down he would have carried on.#With possibly a loss of wageshe was unfit I am sure this would have been the case.#Mr Turner still did not have Munro#s grave location or knowthere was a headstone still standing due to the passage of time but he eventually located the memorial.He said: #I suppose what struck me first of all was his tragic death with him being so young and recently married.#Munro#s headstone was partially paid for by public subscription and therefore his death was felt personally by the local community.#The people of Swindon wished to remember him by their own contributions, which were possibly only pennies or sixpences thrown into a collecting bucket.#Munro died on Wednesday January   of pneumonia with the cause of death being officially registered as spinal meningitis.Just a few days before, the club minute book noted a letter sent to the board members by his we explaining how he was too ill to get out of bed and could not train.The funeral cortege left Munro#s residence in Kent Road and preceded to the Trinity Presbyterian Church which was headed by the New Swindon Town Military Band.Thousands turned out to watch Munro#s final journey.The coffin was covered with beautul wreaths, besides which a carriage was laden with floral tributes.Members of the team acted as pall bearers.Among those present were the directors, secretary and treasurer of Swindon Town, and representatives from Reading FC, Tottenham Hotspur FC, the Western League and the Southern League.Among the floral tributes was one from his team-mates which bore the inscription: #Manfully he did his duty#, and the verse: #A star from out our ranks is gone a light which shone the best no more he#ll play the manly game, for Jimmy has gone to rest.#The directors paid his widow his full week#s wages following his death.Mr Turner said: #He would be remembered by those Swindon supporters interested in the history of the club and the players of the club more than the passing of information to other supporters over the generations.#Every generation has its own heroes mainly those who score the goals as their statistics say a thousands words.#My hero was Don Rogers and to see him play each week was always special.#So it would be special to have a hero who was remembered by his determination when the chips were down.#What kind of player was he #I can only refer to the newspaper articles of the period and suggest even though he was of small stature he was a tough tackling never-say-die player who any team would want on their side.#The reaction of the Swindon public at the time of his death would have been shock and grief because out of nowhere this tough inidual who, according to general reports, played even though injured, was suddenly taken from them.#As in most parts of the country at this time the Swindon fans would have had a close bond with their players, many of whom they would see on a daily basis and some players worked in the railways and the bond would have been so strong.#Football was their outlet from the daily toil of long hours including a half day on Saturday so these players were their heroes and the newspaper reports of his funeral only demonstrate the high esteem he was held.#Mr Turner said Munro#s grave is generally deteriorated and the plans are to restore it to its original condition.The monument will be restored rather than being altered in any way and will include only existing wording.#After renovation an event to be held to re-dedicate the grave and to recognise the achievements of James Munro laid to rest so far from his home town and bring together interested parties who had an association with his career,# he said.#We would also look to replicate some of the events of his funeral and to have a small service.#We want to raise people#s awareness of the pioneers of the people#s game like James Munro who travelled in order to pursue their dream.#It would be idealwe could trace any relatives of James who wish to make contact.#The true cost of the renovation is to be determined and would be raised by public funding.#Although in an ideal world a kind monumental mason from Swindon or even Dundee who would like to do it just for the love of it would be welcome.#The grave of Swindon Town FC#s first manager, Sam Allen, was restored to its former glory in  by enthusiasts after it became derelict and overgrown.Allen joined the club#s committee in  when Munro was a player and campaigners restored it to mark the th anniversary of Swindon winning the Southern League.Anyone who can help the project to restore Munro#s grave or is a family member of Munro can contact James Turner at james.turner@ntlworld.Munro was interviewed by the Football Star in December  where he was asked about his career journey before signing for Swindon.#I did a lot of kicking about as a lad but my first experience with a decent club was when, at the age of , I joined Strathmore ,# he said.#Amongst my comrades were Dickson, who is now playing for Stoke, and Matthews, of Millwall Athletic.#I used to fill the outside-left or outside-right position.#When I was  I went to the Bolton Wanderers whom I assisted for three years # first as outside-left with McNee as a partner, and afterwards as outside-right.#In  I transferred my services to Burton Swts, and for two seasons figured at inside-left with Elkins, who is now at Luton.#We were credited with being the best left-wing in the Second Division of the league.#I have played against every team in the First and Second isions bar Loughborough and have filled every position on the field but goal.#I was in the Bolton Wanderers# eleven which beat Darwen in the final of the Lancashire Cup in , and in the semi-final we had accounted for Blackburn Rovers.#I was also fortunate enough to score two goals against Aston Villa on their own ground when the Wanderers beat them there.#Asked his opinion on the Swindon Town team, Munro said: #Well, for a club which has only recently adopted professionalism, we have, in my opinion, done remarkably well.#Munro was also included in the book Association Football  The Men Who Made It which is arguably the holy grail for any serious collector of football literature.Alfred Gibson and William Gibson#s book is seen as the #indispensable work on the birth and development of football# and covers the sport#s Victorian origins.The book described Munro as a #devoted servant# who was #without a superior# at centre-half in the Southern League

which inspired castle in disneys cinderella","story":"The lost walls and fortications of a north-east fairytale castle have been revealed in a new project carried out by the National Trust for Scotland.Using D technology, past archaeological studies and plans and paintings of Craigie Castle, the th-century #barmkin# walls have been rediscovered and mapped out.Visitors are now able to walk the defensive lines and discover another chapter of the castle’s history.Built in , Craigie in Alford is one of the country’s most famous tower houses. Its unmistakable pink walls are believed to have provided the inspiration for the castle in Walt Disney’s Cinderella.However, the original plans show a forgotten past and the castle, which attracts thousands of visitors to the north-east every year, hasn’t always stood in isolation and was once adjoined by a lower enclosing wall, known in Scots as a #barmkin#.Using a wealth of primary sources, historians have rediscovered the lost walls and, using flagstone paving and interpretation , created a path which retraces the original th-century plans.Annie Robertson MRICS, who works as a chartered surveyor for NTS in the north-east, said: #The purpose of a barmkin was to offer the tower house a private and secure courtyard.#Access was often limited to one main entrance with an iron or timber gate, which would be guarded by a gatekeeper to make sure that any trouble was firmly quashed outside the walls.#There was a wall-walkat the head, giving the watchmen a better vantage for monitoring the surrounding approach. It was also useful during a defensive attack, allowing fire to rain down from above.#Inside the courtyard, there were usually a number of structures or ‘laigh biggins’ , which provided areas for the ancillary aspects of le in a tower house. These may have included a brewery, dairy, bakehouse, stables, byre, stores, laundry or buildings to house tradespeople such as blacksmiths, carpenters, chandlers or weavers. The courtyard would have been a busy place, full of the noise and smells of people going about their daily work.#Some livestock may have also been brought in for over-wintering or to protect them from thieves, particularly during any times of conflict. This hive of activity is much unlike the peaceful tranquillity surrounding many tower houses today.#The wall would have dramatically altered Craigie’s appearance and, seen from a distance, its slender, seven-storey tower would have looked heavier and more deeply anchored to the ground.Barmkin walls were an integral part of early tower house architecture in Scotland. Today, the footprint of many courtyard castles and houses, including Leith Hall near Huntly, follow the lines of the old barmkin enclosures.Dr Daniel Rhodes, NTS archaeologist, added: #To be able to take our archaeological knowledge and recreate the past for our visitors to enjoy is a fantastic opportunity.#It must have been a bustling courtyard often full of livestock and people. A real comparison to today’s fairytale beauty.#The project involved NTS staff and archaeologists as well as local volunteers and supporters, including local Professor Ian Young and his we Sylvia.You can walk the new pathway at Craigie Castle and find out more information about the property, as well as up to date Covid- restrictions and guidelines, by visiting www.nts.org.uk visit places craigieFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/01/Craigievar-Castle-144-DS-40.jpg ","title":"rediscover your aberdeen and aberdeenshire put north east into focus for new photo competition","story":"A photography competition celebrating the best of the north-east has been launched.VisitAberdeenshire and the Evening Express are inviting keen photographers to share an image via social media throughout the #RediscoverABDN initiative.The competition will have dferent monthly themes throughout the year and begins today with a focus on lockdown. vw, px\"  You can share your snaps taken of the stunning scenery you see while out walking, making sure to stick to the guidance of staying close to home.And as the north-east boasts a wealth of beauty spots on our doorsteps, you could even capture scenes from your window.This month’s winner will be announced on February .Upcoming themes will include inspiring city architecture, hidden gems,The Evening Express and VisitAberdeenshire will select a winner for each theme.Winners will be contacted via direct message.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is ridiculous. I have attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will deliver results, not spend all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people#s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,As we move into  and parents, teachers and pupils once again find themselves facing additional challenges to deliver and attain a full and rounded education, it is worthwhile remembering the role that music can and should play in improving our lives.Firstly, music will help to support and sustain our young people through the coming months. For children and adults alike, the creative arts play a vital role in promoting wellbeing and positive mental health, providing both a means of expression during the isolation of #lockdown# and a practical as well as enjoyable pastime.Secondly # and just as importantly # playing an instrument is complementary to academic subjects and has been shown emphatically to improve wider educational success. As we consider the often daunting challenge of theto home schooling, those parents whose children can mix domestic timetables with musical lessons will understand the release and stimulation playing an instrument can deliver.Across society music is integral to our identities and is made to be shared. We now have the means to do that successfully and safely with online tools whose use has been well-honed by recent experience.So whether you#re at the start of a musical journey, or are well advanced in music-making let#s keep singing, keep dancing and keep music lessons flowing, particularly while the restrictions necessitated by the pandemic keep us apart in our own homes.Dr Kenneth Taylor, head teacher, St Mary’s Music School, EdinburghSir,As Scotland faces a second national lockdown, the country#s national walking charity, Paths for All, is encouraging the public to explore local walking routes in a bid to help combat social isolation, anxiety and loneliness while maintaining physical health.The call follows the launch of the charity#s Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, which asks people to make the pledge of walking every day throughout January.The campaign includes an online hub which outlines the importance of walking and regular physical activity during the winter months. A iety of activities and ideas, designed to motivate iniduals of all ages, are available on the hub with podcast recommendations, creative walking advice and prize incentives.In what is traditionally the time of year which sees a surge of gym memberships and fitness plans we suggest taking up walking instead as part of our new year resolutions.With walking being one of the few essential reasons for leaving your home, it is the perfect exercise and now is the time to get into a walking exercise routine which is consistent with the current government guidelines. Walking can help with our social health as the guidelines allow us to meet with one person from one other household outside.Last year we saw an increase in Scots taking up walking during the first lockdown and the outcome has highlighted just how many benefits are attributed to walking and how outdoor exercise as many times a day as we can has become an important way to look after physical and mental wellbeing.Follow the campaign over on Paths for All social media channels #WalkOnceADay.For more information on the Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, visit the Paths for All website.Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer, Paths for AllSir,The New Year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals. But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the COVID- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us.From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government#s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month to fundraise in your  area, you can help to make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk or contact jen.lindsay@nspcc.org.uk by email.Jen Lindsay, community fundraising manager, NSPCC Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"boaters urged to abide by covid rules","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The revised guidance recognises that travel is severely restricted by law and owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in.RYA Scotland, Sail Scotland and British Marine Scotland have joined together to encourage boat owners to use the services of staff where their boat is stored,at all possible, in an effort to avoid making a journey, to respect that storage providers may not be able to open and to advise owners to contact providers before travelling to confirm access.The information is tailored towards RYA affiliated clubs and recognised training centres as well as inidual members and the wider boating community across Scotland.James Allan, chief executive officer at RYA Scotland, said: #Lockdown will be disappointing for everyone, but it is still possible to go boating as a form of exercise and spending some time afloat or near the water is great for our wellbeing. It is important to remember we are in the grip of a pandemic that has become signicantly worse in recent weeks. The overriding message for Scotland’s boating community is to stay at home wherever possible as we must all help stop the spread of the virus.#Importantly in this lockdown, owners may travel within their local authority to undertake essential maintenance on their boat but may not stay longer than theof time required to undertake essential maintenance.To check what level of measures apply in your area or venue where you intend to participate in activity, please check the postcode on the Scottish Government webpage.In the meantime, RYA Scotland has decided to postpone its directly organised, non-virtual events and training in response to these measures to protect participants, volunteers and others and to reduce the risk of placing an additional burden on the emergency services at what is a hugely testing time.The RYA will be providing a range of online events and #SailFromHome activities.

In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark, which is grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are # the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,In order to avoid fishermen being adversely impacted by export delays, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross has called on the UK Government to bring forward compensation to the affected fishermen and deliver it immediately.The SNP government must also accept responsibility and deal with ongoing issues involving their agency, Food Standards Scotland, which are holding up exports within Scotland.Both of Scotland’s governments must work together to deliver for Scottish fishermen.We in the Scottish Conservatives will back Scotland’s fishing communities all the way.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,The Scottish SPCA is appealing to animal lovers in Scotland to donate much-needed food to its National Wildle Rescue Centre in Fishcross, Alloa.Scotland#s animal welfare charity had its busiest ever year in  with over , wildle casualties admitted.The pandemic caused quite a signicant drop in the number of animals arriving at the wildle hospital. Over , wild animals were brought to the centre in .As we are entering fox cub season, we are appealing for Pedigree puppy food and puppy milk.Last year, we cared for  foxes, of which  were cubs. It can be a struggle to keep up with so many hungry mouths to feed.We expect to be even busier with admissions this year so we need help from members of the public.If anyone can help with food for these young mammals, we would appreciate anything that people can spare.Puppy meat can be purchased from the wildle centre#s Amazon wishlist http:amzn.to xkUe.Steven Gray Scottish SPCA National Wildle Rescue Centre managerSir,New Year resolutions can be a good starting point for making longer term health and lestyle improvements, but most people do not stick to them. Reasons for quitting include a lack of time, a lack of support from other people and feeling daunted by unrealistic targets.Often, goals are unachievable because they are too dficult, or they do not allow enough time for you to make gradual changes.There is nothing wrong with aiming high and being ambitious, but it is important that your goal is not too dficult or time-consuming as this could leave you feeling daunted.Ask yourself the following questions: Is the goal too ambitious  Is the timeframe realistic  What specic changes do I need to make  Can I fit my new healthy behaviour around my other commitments Breaking large goals down into smaller goals can make them feel more achievable and less daunting.For example,you are aiming to lose weight, the NHS recommends that you aim to lose around  to lbsa week. You should be able to achieve this by cutting down your calorie intake by about  to  calories each day. It might take longer than planned to lose the weight, but you are more likely to stick to it and not give up.Plan how you will achieve your goal and what changes you will make to ensure you stick to it. There are online resources available to help you plan your healthy activities, such as the NHS couch to km programme or the NHS programmes for stopping smoking, cutting down alcohol and losing weight.Try to be patient and don’t expect the results from just one or two weeks of dieting to show on the weighing scales, as it may take longer.A good way to motivate you is to involve other people. If you know someone who has a similar goal to yours, try to involve them as a #buddy# to provide mutual support.They may even be able to push you a little bit harder, helping you to achieve your goals sooner. Look for groups on social media who share your goal.If you miss a fitness session or have an alcoholic drink, cigarette or bar of chocolate, try not to feel guilty. Think about what might have triggered the deviation from your goal and try to avoid it in future. Forgive yourself and aim to get back to achieving your goal as soon as possible.On average, it takes between  and  days for something to become a long-term habit. Make goals that you want to be able to stick to long term, such as improving your overall fitness, stopping smoking or maintaining your weight.If you can make it through these first few weeks, you will notice that things will become much easier.Dr Helen Flaherty, head of health promotion and education, Heart Research UK"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 22 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It doesn’t have to be about their sight at all.If you, or someone you know, could benefit from speaking to someone, please call our Helpline on   . We can set up a chat within  hours and the service can be used as many times as needed.James Adams, director, Royal National Institute of Blind People Scotland, EdinburghDear Alister,In the weeks since the UK left the European Union, I have been contacted by numerous Argyll and Bute residents and businesses who share my very deep concerns about the future sustainability and, indeed, the survival of our vital shellfish and fishing sector.The seafood sector is a vital component of our already-fragile regional economy and is now hit by the inability, virtually overnight, for producers and processors to get their time-sensitive products to market or to customers.If allowed to go unresolved, this sector is likely to disappear, badly affecting Argyll and Bute’s overall recovery and future growth.Fish and shellfish from Argyll and Bute are high quality products of international renown.The industry has been a mainstay and a major employer in the area for many decades, sustaining not only the local economy but making a signicant contribution to the Scottish and UK economies.I am now hearing from long-standing fishing families, newer start-up businesses and companies employing hundreds of people that,urgent action is not taken, they will have to close their doors for good.This would be devastating for Argyll and Bute, where the sector comprises many single-family operated vessels, smaller fleets and artisan producers as well as some medium to larger enterprises.As a council we are doing all that we can to support these businesses and prevent this imminent disaster.Our officers are working behind the scenes to assist and are in constant discussions with the Scottish Government to reiterate the critical need for the commercial hubs to operate smoothly, ensuring that the right processes are in place to help businesses get their goods to their customers.We are also speaking to Argyll and Bute producers to help them navigate these new processes and to issue all the necessary paperwork where appropriate, so that these valuable products reach buyers.Delays on both sides of the border have already seen valuable products being lost, together with valued customers who are seeking their produce where.Very urgent action and assistance is needed now from your government in order to prevent this traditional Scottish industry sector from disappearing altogether.Most urgently of all, getting products to market must be streamlined, simplied and speeded up.These products need to be prioritised over products with longer shelf lives –the situation is allowed to persist then very many companies will have no choice but to give up, costing jobs and much-needed revenue to the treasury.In addition to improving processes and the speed of delivery here in the UK, these businesses, so vital to Argyll and Bute and Scotland’s economic recovery and future success, need your government to negotiate urgently with its counterparts in Europe to identy and resolve the delays in allowing fresh goods to arrive in and then to progress on to customers.I cannot state strongly enough that these actions are needed now. More is required, though, in the medium and longer terms, to help this beleaguered industry to get afloat again and regain some buoyancy.Producers and customers need reassurance that future supplies will be prioritised and to regain confidence in the industry through dedicated marketing and investment where possible through the £m fisheries fund your government announced following the publication of the agreement.Our seafood sector desperately needs Government to take action to secure its survival. Please do what you can, urgently, to avoid its demise.Robin Currie, Argyll and Bute Council leader"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 29 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I see Loch Fyne langoustines are sent to the EU but, living fairly close to Loch Fyne, I don#t seem to be able to purchase the product locally.I am sure UK supermarkets would be only too happy to sell, crabs, lobsters and langoustines provided by Scottish fishermen but it seems they would prefer to supply the EU rather than the home market.Fishing boats enter Campbeltown Loch regularly but there is no local supply of their catch as this is transported #up the road# as soon as it is landed.I just suggest that supplying the UK market is maybe a way out of the continual problems with our #friendly# neighbours who seem hell bent on putting continual obstacles in the way of sensible trading partnerships.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.I grew up in Peninver and have been hiking on the hills around the Rest and Be Thankful many times, all year round. My initial thought a few years ago was that the best solution to the problem of landslides on the Rest was building avalanche tunnels like there are on the A at Lochcarron but there is practically zero ground to build on on the downhill side of the A.The big catch-pits along the uphill side of the road do seem to work but, in the long-term, removing the unstable soil and planting lots of trees and shrubs on the rest of the hillside to hold it in place, might be the best solution.Rather than replace the road through the Rest and Be Thankful with a new route through another glen or to continue trying to stop an unstable hillside from obeying the laws of gravity, how much would it cost to remove all the soil in these watercourses which regularly slide Maybe cost-wise removing the unstable soil from the Rest would be cheaper # and quicker  # than building a whole new road If there is a landslide in a watercourse, it weakens the soil directly above it so that will slide next, followed by the soil above it, etc. The bedrock at the Rest is only a couple of feet below the surface so removing the soil in gullies liable to slide after rain might be a lot cheaper than building a new road through another glen.For a permanent solution, perhaps close off the road from Ardgartan to the Lochgoilhead junction for six months in the winter, pipe water from Loch Restil to the top of the gullies prone to sliding # at the base of the first exposed bedrock high up the gullies # let the water run for three or four months, and hydraulically remove all the loose soil, then in the spring shovel all the accumulated debris of the other side of the road It would mean short-term inconvenience for a lot of people but it might save a lot of money, time, and perhaps lives, in the long-term.Harry Hood, New Hampshire, USA. As children and young peopleto being home-schooled due to the new lockdown, there is no doubt that this will have a continued detrimental impact on mental health and wellbeing.As a coalition, we applaud the Scottish Government’s greater investment in mental health services. However, a view we share with other organisations, is that this investment is simply not sufficient.Mental health services were already under immense strain prior to Covid-, with children waiting considerable s of time for support. Recent statistics from December, for example, point to the fact that more than , children have been waiting over a year for treatment.This pandemic will only serve to make matters even worse as services deal with a backlog of those already suffering from mental health problems, added to which will be those who have developed problems over the course of lockdown.What is needed is a national crusade, delivering signicant investment in the public, private and third sectors to deliver adequate mental health support, both during and as we recover from Covid-. We must also use this as an opportunity to radically transform our mental health services, both for now and for the future, refocusing on prevention and early intervention.In the meantime, we would urge those children and their families who feel they need help not to hold back and look to get the support they need.The Scottish Children’s Services Coalition: Kenny Graham, Falkland House School Lynn Bell, LOVE Learning Stephen McGhee, Spark of Genius Niall Kelly, Young Foundations.The serious neurological condition Myalgic Encephalomylitiswill sadly be all too familiar to some of your readers at least , children and adults in Scotland live with ME, also diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome .Many face barriers in accessing health and social care services that meet their needs, and some professionals still don’t understand the impact of ME and its symptoms.UK charity Action for ME is trying to change this by offering people with ME across Scotland one-to-one advocacy, via phone and email, to help them be heard, understand their rights and access support.We want to expand this much-needed service, and are seeking enthusiastic volunteers in Scotland who can make the most of our online advocate training programme to develop their skills, gain valuable experience, and help improve the lives of vulnerable people with ME, all from home.Anyone who is interested in finding out more can call , emailor visit our website– we would love to hear from good listeners who can spare two hours a week.Alice Cranston, advocacy coordinator, Action for ME."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I’m anticipating an end to the pandemic – coming out of the gloom. And there have been many episodes in le in which I’ve lived in the hope of emerging through the other side of the dark night. I thank God for the hope he gives me. But, how do we know when the darkness of night has ended In a rabbinic school, a very old rabbi posed a clever question to his young students: #When can it be said that night truly ends and the day begins  When is that moment when from darkness there comes light, when it can really be said the gloom has passed and brightness is here #The first student, still a bit immature, replied: #Well, it’s when it says so on the internet.#The rabbi smiled and told him: #That’s not what I mean.#The next student said: #It’s when you can distinguish sheep from goats, because in the dark they look very similar, but when light appears they can be told apart.#The rabbi told him it was a wiser answer, but not the one.The third student said: #When you can tell the fig tree and palm tree apart.#This interested the rabbi, but, no, this wasn’t it. The rabbi askedthere were any other ideas, but there weren’t. So he told them the answer: #It is when you look at another person and do not see a stranger but a brother or sister this is when know the night has ended and the day begins.#Father Tony Wood, Saint Kieran#s Catholic Church, Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +viaYOURTWITTERNAMEHERE\" title\"Tweet this\"TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

After nearly a year of people taking exercise and essential journeys on foot during Covid- lockdowns, plans to keep the nation walking are more important than ever.#The increases in people walking, has highlighted the lack of good infrastructure to support safe and enjoyable travel by foot. Communities that lack local facilities within walking distance have had challenges. That’s why we are calling for investment in everyday walking to build back better after the pandemic, and respond to the challenges of air pollution, climate change and Scotland#s health record.#Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer of Paths for All, said: #We launch our manesto at a crucial point of change for Scotland as we begin to plan for le after Covid-. During lockdown, we have seen a rise in the number of people walking as many used it as a way to cope with the pressures of everyday le, to reach essential shops and services in their  area, and to connect with others and nature in a safe way.#But we need to do more to make regular walking an enjoyable and accessible choice for everyone in Scotland, from all walks of le. By investing in walking programmes and safe, attractive places to walk we can signicantly improve the nation’s health, reducing health inequalities and pressure on our NHS.#Brendan Paddy, director of Ramblers Scotland, said: #Our joint manesto makes a compelling case for investment to make walking safe and attractive for everyone in Scotland.#We believe walking can play a vital role in Scotland’s response to the challenges of Covid- and climate change # and the obesity, bioersity and mental health crises we face.

The news was welcomed by the prospective Conservative candidate for Argyll and Bute, Mr Ralph Leishman.He told the Courier: ‘This is a definite step forward and knocks on the head suggestions that the Scottish Office is totally opposed to CalMac as the operator on this route.’Scottish Office reservations are believed to centre on proposals to use the MV Claymore on the route. This would mean £, would have to be spent upgrading another vessel for relief work for its west coast services.They are also said to be concerned that no private firm appeared to be interested in running the service all year-round.CalMac’s participation in the project has been backed by politicians on both sides of the Irish Sea.Both Scottish Secretary Mr Michael Forsyth and Prime Minister Mr John Major were believed this week to have been lobbied at Westminster by CalMac’s supporters.Northern Ireland secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew is said to be among those who have contacted Mr Forsyth to support CalMac’s involvement.The project supporters have been asking the Scottish Office to consider the economic benefits the ferry could bring to Ballycastle and Campbeltown, which are both areas of high unemployment. The project is expected to create around  jobs,  of them in Argyll.The only other company which has expressed an interest in running the service, Seacat, only wants to operate it over a four-month summer season.FIFTY YEARS AGOMr Noble ill # so Provost steps in to open new airport terminalThe new passenger terminal at Machrihanish Airport will be opened on Friday at pm by Provost Dan McKinven, in the absence of Mr Michael Noble MP Minister of Trade, through illness.The new building, which has been provided by the Department of Trade and Industry in conjunction with the Ministry of Defence, is a small one situated within a self-contained enclave and is designed to improve the facilities of BEA passengers using Machrihanish.Before the terminal was built, all BEA passengers had to be taken by bus between the aircraft and the old terminal building near the main entrance of the airport, and, latterly, to a dispersal point on the south side.Under the new improvements, BEA aircraft will now taxi directly to the new terminal area, and passengers will be able to walk the short distance from the aircraft to the terminal.A new road traffic control system has also been provided because aircraft taxiing from the runway to the terminal have to cross a public road.The new arrangements have the additional advantage of reducing the distance, and, consequently, the journey time between the airport and Campbeltown.A complete shake-up of BEA Highland services is on the way. It could mean higher fares and smaller planes and the end of the name British European Airways on some routes.Last year the Highlands and Islands routes cost the company more than £,.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and FlashesThe annual meeting in connection with the Campbeltown Cottage Hospital will be held on Tuesday first at . in the Council Room.Local footballers had again an idle Saturday last week on account of bad weather.

His solution is even more batty.Driven by resentment and sepia-tinted post-Empire English nationalism, cloaked in talk of Britain and the UK, the Tories have jemmied the UK out of the world’s largest and most successful single market.Having placed the UK as a #third country# outside the EU, alongside Somalia and Kazakhstan, it is not the EU to blame for the barriers to free trade, Mr Abendroth, but the UK government and those who parroted the cruel myths of Brexiteer #sunny uplands#.Mr Abendroth suggests that the fishing industry merely sells into the domestic market as a replacement to EU trade, without thought to the timescales required to repurpose supply lines and create a viable home market # evenit could be done fishing businesses would already be bankrupt.Scotland’s economy and the living standards and opportunities of Scots have been thrown under the wheels of England’s red Brexit bus. Never have the consequences of permitting Westminster to rule our country been more stark.But the time is coming when Scotland will have the historic opportunity to regain the huge benefits of EU membership and become a normal, thriving, independent state at the heart of Europe. There is an empty seat at the top table in Europe # and it won’t be empty for long.Ron Wilson, secretary, Kintyre SNP.Remember the closing stages of the Brexit negotiations  Boris Johnson pretended he was holding out to get the best deal for fishermen. In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark – grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are – the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal ward.Keith Abendroth is spot on with his call for the fishing industry in Campbeltown to supply the home market.During my three-and-a-half years in the town it was possible to buy directly from the boat on occasion but it was nigh on impossible to buy fresh live lobster in the town#s fish shop.When I was new to the town , I experienced some shocking service at the some of the small retailers who I always endeavour to support. It is easier to get a full range of seafood and fish in Peebles, about  miles from the sea, which has an excellent fish shop supplied from Eyemouth on the East Coast.Much Welsh shellfish is sent by air to Europe. I often wondered why lorries trundled from Campbeltown across the Rest and Be Thankful and all the way to the English Channel crossings.Much of the st century supply chain is a mystery to me. For instance, much Pacic wild salmon is processed in China before being exported to the UK.  It is an excellent alternative to the farmed version at roughly the same price.Surely a town with an airport could develop a sea product freight service or is it simply down to volume, weight and cost Mark Davey, Peebles.Two weeks ago, at Campbeltown Free Church, we received a letter of thanks from Blythswood Care for filling shoeboxes to support the  Shoe Box Appeal.However, we are aware that many who contributed do not belong to Campbeltown Free Church.So, through the pages of the Courier, can I thank them for their kindness towards people they have never met but whose lives have been enriched by their generosity Dr Rodger M Crooks, Campbeltown Free Church minister.Like many, many other residents in Argyll and Bute I have received through the post a bizarre leaflet from the Liberal Democrats. Bizarre, because it promotes a candidate standing in a completely dferent seat # Caithness, Sutherland and Ross.Meanwhile, the good folk of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross have been equally mystied as to why the hapless Lib Dems have sent them leaflets promoting a candidate in Argyll and Bute!The Lib Dems have certainly lost their way when it comes to their policy on the EU # but it seems that they#ve lost their way in Scotland too.Les Wilson, Islay.Earlier this month the Prime Minister announced a third national lockdown. Although necessary, these measures mean many of our veterans will be facing the next several weeks – or months – completely alone.And while the vaccine rollout out across the country provides some hope, social isolation and loneliness poses a real threat to our elderly this winter, among them many former RAF personnel and their partners supported by the fund.To help combat this, last year the RAF Benevolent Fund introduced a weekly Check and Chat service to support members of the RAF Family experiencing loneliness. I speak to one such gentleman every Tuesday. He lives alone and spent much of  totally isolated and, for him, this service truly is a leline. We chat about what he’s been up to, what he’s cooking for tea, to his time in the RAF and often I’m the only person he will speak to for days.The fund also organises weekly telephone friendship groups, provides access to a listening and counselling service, relationship counselling support, and an online wellbeing portal to help support emotional wellbeing amongst the veteran community.Throughout the pandemic, many of us have learnt more about our neighbours and local community. That’s why we are calling on the people of Scotland to consider whether they know any RAF veterans, or their spouses or widows, who may be experiencing loneliness.To refer someone to the RAF Benevolent Fund, please visit rafbf.org or call   .Air Vice-Marshal Chris Elliot, chief executive, RAF Benevolent Fund."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 29 2021","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I cannot help but think that it bodes well for the future of that great nation to have a man of faith leading it.Returning to the words, some of the finest and most moving that day came from a young woman called Amanda Gorman.She spoke of lting the gaze of the nation not to what stands between its people, but to what stands before them, of closing ides because they know that, to put their future first, they must first put dferences aside.#The new dawn,# she said, #blooms as we free it. For there is always light,only we’re brave enough to see itonly we’re brave enough to BE it.#In the first chapter of his Gospel, John says: #The light continues to shine in the darkness and the darkness has never put it out.#We are called, all of us, to be part of that light and to be bearers of it into a dark and troubled world.

A new-build, fit-for-purpose hub will be used as a meeting place, a thriving place for all ages, groups and clubs to come together in a stunning environment.SID believes that a community hub will play a pivotal role in the area#s long-term recovery from the pandemic, joining the dots between people that require support – connecting them to a range of services to promote inidual and community wellbeing.SID already has £, secured in match funding from Glenmorangie, the owners of the nearby Ardbeg Distillery. This existing commitment demonstrates the strong private sector partnerships in place and their support for the island#s communities.Hamish Torrie, CSR director from the Glenmorangie Company, said: ‘We, the Glenmorangie Company, have been working for many years on the development of this project with SID and the South Islay community.#We are delighted that SID has secured the funding which will, at last, enable the playing fields project to move to the next stage of its development. The community hub will be vital in sustaining the fabric of south Islay for the future.#SID now needs to secure a further £, in match funding to reach its target to deliver the full project. Part of this will be secured through the launch of a community shares initiative within the coming weeks.This project has been in development for a number of years and is anxiously awaited by the community which has shaped it over the years.Local development officer Alyson MacGillivray said: #SID and the community of South Islay have been on a long journey to get to this point. We are so excited to share this very exciting news with our community, particularly after the challenging  months we have all endured – some positive news is just what the community needs at this time.#SID’s chairman, John Findlay, said: #This is a fantastic project that will benefit not only South Islay but the whole of the island. It will give the community a real boost particularly during these challenging times.#I would like to take this opportunity to thank the SID staff: Alyson MacGillivray, local development officer Bonnie Wood, project manager and Fiona Aitchison, finance and admin officer, for all their hard work on this project and in securing substantial government funding.#My thanks also go to the SID board of directors who, through their voluntary roles, have supported the staff every step of the way.#Robin Currie, leader of Argyll and Bute Council and councillor for the Kintyre and the Islands ward, said: #This is tremendous news for Port Ellen and indeed Islay as a whole. This will be a wonderful and much-needed facility for the island and my thanks to SID for all its hard work thus far.#Fellow Kintyre and the Islands councillor Anne Horn added: #It is fantastic news that SID has been successful in securing a grant from the Scottish Government Regeneration Capital Fund to enable the long-awaited development of the pavilion into a community hub.#This will be a fantastic asset for Port Ellen and for the whole island of Islay. Very well done to everyone for their hard work seeing this plan come to fruition.#South Islay Developmenthas been involved in the development of Port Ellen and its surrounding area since .The organisation was originally established to help address some of the long-term employment and poverty issues in the area and has seen signicant success during its time in operation.A range of capital and revenue projects has been undertaken including development of the only filling station in the area, new motorhome pitches and the harbour pontoons and office in conjunction with partners.Fèis Ìle, a week-long celebration of Scotland’s most distillery-packed island with whisky, music, dancing and more, has had to be cancelled for the second year running due to the Covid- pandemic.Organisers had their fingers crossed that it would be possible to hold the  event between May  and June , but that has proved impossible.In a statement, they said: #With deep regret we announce that this year’s festival is cancelled.#Keeping everyone safe is our top priority. Eventravel to Islay is allowed, the ceilidhs, tastings and large events that make the fèis what it is, will not be able to take place.#We also need to allow for the fact that people need to be able to make their plans to travel and stay.#The dates for the  festival are from Friday May  to Saturday June  and, regarding those who already hold tickets, fèis organisers confirmed they will #be in touch soon about refunds, or transferring to #.The statement concluded: #Islay and its businesses would love to welcome you back when restrictions allow.

John Reid and Alex Harvey judged the tractors.Two pairs of horses competed for the first time since .TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOKinloch Park trees face the chopA number of historic trees in Campbeltown are facing the axe.A recent survey of trees belonging to Argyll and Bute District Council has revealed as many as  are in poor condition and may need to be felled.The sycamores at Kinloch Park are amongst the worst hit. The survey, by a private consultant, revealed  trees were causing concern.A number of trees around Kintyre Park have also been identied as suffering from internal fungal rot. The other  trees causing concern are spread around the town. They include at least two at the council offices in Dell Road. The trees at Kinloch Park have suffered damage to their bark over the years and this is thought to have contributed to the rot.Councillors were expected to meet officials to discuss the situation on Wednesday. Councillor George McMillan told the Courier: ‘It is a great pity about the trees that will have to come down. The trees at Kinloch Park have been there as long as anyone alive can remember.’The council#s policy is to replace any trees which have been felled. Councillor McMillan said he hoped it might be possible to phase the felling over two years.The trees were planted shortly after the park was created in the early s by infilling the shallow mudflats between Campbeltown and Dalintober.FIFTY YEARS AGOQuay mishapWestern Ferries# Campbeltown-Ireland vessel the Sound of Islay was delayed on Monday when a large articulated lorry slipped while being reversed on board.The cabin unit of the lorry, which is owned by local contractor Mr William McMurchy, was hitched to a trailer loaded with timber.

No-one was injured.The lorry, driven by Mr Bruce McMurchy, was later winched off the Sound of Islay.Operations to free the obstruction were hampered by the state of the tide, which was ebbed at the time.The ferry left for Red Bay on Monday afternoon.New houses completedCampbeltown’s Princes Street redevelopment housing scheme has been completed, three months ahead of schedule.The first house key will be handed over next Friday.An official of Campbeltown Town Council said the council was satisfied with the workmanship of the contractors, Ferguson and Martin, the Campbeltown Building consortium.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGODistrict doings # CourDance # What was generally regarded as the finalof the season in this district was held in the recreation hall on the evening of the th ultimate and compared favourably with any similar event which preceded it.Fortied by tact and experience, the committee displayed unusual talent throughout the proceedings and the programme submitted was of a ied and interesting nature.Of a special interest among the vocal items was a pleasing rendition of ‘Let the rest of the world go by’ by Mrs Hendrick, who had a rousing reception, and was the recipient of merited approbation.The usual visitors were present from distant districts and Tarbert and Torrisdale sent representatives of the ‘fair sex’ which gave Carradale well-grounded reasons to ‘look to its laurels’ and it is generally conceded it takes something over the ordinary to occasion that.The catering was in the capable hands of Mr Walker who, with Messrs Cameron and Crichton, rose to the occasion as never before in their respective positions and no laudatory adjectives are required now in Kintyre to describe how Mr Henderson discharges his duties as MC."},{"url":null,"title":"leader february 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Indeed the #evil# Tories are currently in negotiations with the USA, Australia and New Zealand for trade agreements which again would not have been either allowed or possiblewe had been tied to EU regulations.Had the SNP secured independence, it remains to be seenthe EU would have accepted Scotland into the EU, given the financial deficit it currently endures and continues to do so thanks to the current pandemic.Perhaps I should remind Mr Wilson it is the UK government that has managed to secure Scottish jobs using the furlough scheme and secured Covid- vaccinations for all of the UK which seems to have rattled the EU cage that Mr Wilson also occupies.I do agree with him, however, had Scotland been an independent country then his submission of being linked to Somalia and Kazakhstan would be near the truth.Finally, my suggestion to Scottish fishermen was stated in good faith and a possible way out of problems they are experiencing with the EU at present when there was no need to alter the arrangements in place prior to the UK leaving the EU.Knowing from previous items published by the Courier on behalf of Mr Wilson, this is the only time I intend to respond and will continue to polish my brass neck!The vote to leave the EU took place in June , four and half years ago # four and half years in which to start making plans for changes to counter loss or reduction of the existing market for fish products in Europe.I haven#t read of any such plans but, of course, that will be the fault of Westminster the government there should have found new markets for Scottish fish. Doubtless, the government in Holyrood, that is perpetually demanding more powers be devolved to it, was far too busy organising Indyref to spend time looking after the livelihoods of Scottish fishermen.It was obvious that concessions had to be made by both sides in any trade deal, post-Brexit, and it was inconceivable the EU would accept any deal that totally blocked EU boats from our waters instantly. However, Alan Reid and Ron Wilson, it is not bureaucracy on this side of the Channel that is slowing the movement of goods to Europe # that blame lies entirely with a vindictive EU, determined to punish Britain for having the temerity to leave a failing, despotic authority.Ron Wilson, you claim the time is coming when Scotland will reap the benefits of EU membership. Can you explain to me how a country with a massive deficit, . per cent of GDP before the pandemic hit and astronomical now, can even apply for membership, when to qualy a country has to bring its deficit below three per cent Add to that the fact Nicola Sturgeon has affirmed an independent Scotland will retain the pound sterling as currency and EU rules state that a country in monetary union with another country, outside of the EU, cannot under any circumstances join it.Instead of complaining, give thanks that the people of Scotland are being vaccinated now, not in four months# time at best, had we still been dependent on the EU to supply the vaccines.It is being reported, both by opposition MSPs and the national press, that Scotland#s vaccine strategy is being outpaced and starting to seriously lag behind the other three UK home nations and that the SNP has no desire to convene a vaccination task force nor take up the offer of additional British military personnel, to further assist NHS Scotland.Yet, in this time of national emergency, is it not extraordinary that the SNP, Scotland#s devolved administration, has set up a task force to campaign for independence.Rick Warren wrote in The Purpose-Driven Le: #Humility is not thinking less of yourself, but rather thinking less about yourself.#Can Scotland#s domestic government, the SNP, think less on independence and more on beating Covid- and our schools, hospitals and jobs The bins on Kilkerran Road were not collected on Friday last so I left the bin as it would normally be collected the following morning, even though on a weekend.When midday on Saturday came and went, I checked the council website to find out that a vehicle breakdown was the cause of the non-collection and the bins would be collected when a vehicle was available.I left the bin out fully expecting it not to be collected before Monday. To my amazement, at .pm on Saturday afternoon the #freighter# came trundling along and emptied all the bins along Kilkerran Road.This is truly remarkable to have the bins collected not only on a Saturday afternoon but on a freezing cold day into the bargain.These council employees on bin collection, grounds and gardens maintenance deserve every praise and thanks that we the public can bestow.These are the front-line people who keep our town clean and tidy, cemeteries in prime condition and they are often taken for granted.Next time you see them, take a minute to say thanks. They deserve it and more.I have been visited by a Gigha milk #fairy# # or should it be brownie I have been the very appreciative recipient of a large bottle of delicious Wee Isle Dairy milk on a number of occasions.

We are delivering the vaccination across a large and challenging geography, during winter, while simultaneously coordinating iable supply of vaccine products.#The challenge really cannot be underestimated but it is thanks to all the staff involved with this programme and the tremendous effort they have put in that we have been able to deliver the vaccine to, as it stands now,  per cent of our population.#Given our remote and rural geography, the majority of the delivery of vaccine to the public will be coordinated by our GP practices, which are ideally located and experienced to do this, given they support our flu delivery programme so well every year. We will, along with Highland and Argyll and Bute councils, provide any additional resources and support that they need to do this successfully.#For our staff in more remote and rural areas, the vaccination is being coordinated by local teams. In Inverness, we are currently using the Centre for Health Science as a location for larger scale delivery.#Dr Davidson explained that one particular challenge was the contact and scheduling of non-NHS frontline staff for vaccination. NHS Highland has a dedicated team in place to support this in the south and mid areas of Highland where the number is largest.He said: #Feedback from colleagues, both those who are vaccinating and those who have been vaccinated, has been positive. We’re also hearing good feedback from those who have been vaccinated by our colleagues in general practice.#We know everyone will be keen to get their vaccine as quickly as possible but would ask that you all please be patient.#We are working our way through the priority groups and you will be asked to attend for your vaccine by your GP practice when it is time for your vaccine. Please don’t call them, they will contact you directly for your appointment.#Dr Davidson added: #Delivery of the vaccine has been exciting to see but it is important to remember that this is only one part of how we can win this fight against Covid-.#Protection for an inidual following vaccination may take weeks to develop and the extent to which vaccination prevents spread of Covid is still unclear. That is why it is so important that, as well as taking up the opportunity to get vaccinated when you are contacted, that we still continue to follow the guidance on how you can keep yourself and others safe.#Please follow FACTS: wear a face covering, avoid crowded areas, clean surfaces, keep a two metre distance and, what I would really like to stress, the importance of self-isolating and booking a testyou have symptoms.#"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week february 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

birds, which could then lead to legal issues.Mr Merchant, who previously lived in East Lothian and operates his business from Cambridgeshire, said: ldquoThe very best thing you can do is mesh above the pavement area.ldquoYou completely mesh above the pavement area so you are excluding the birds from either side but leaving the central reservation open.ldquoThat means that the cost of the netting operation is dramatically reduced and, secondly,you kick all the resident birds out from the under the bridge they are going to go to peoplersquos properties in Dunbar and cause a huge nuisance.\"Mr Merchant said that left the birds to roost and perch in the central reservation of the bridge and their droppings would fall onto the road, rather than the pavement.At a meeting of Dunbar Community Council last month, it was revealed that work under the bridge was due to take place in mid-February.East Lothian Council said that the bridge was lsquohomersquo to ldquohundreds of pigeons which are causing problems for drivers and also fouling the footpath.It was said that work could take up to five days while the underside of the bridge was cleaned and re-netted in a bid to prevent pigeons from roosting there in the future."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-new-variant-symptoms-revealed-research","story":"Data released by the Office for National Statisticsshow that some symptoms appear

By not filling the holes in, they will collapse in among themselves and create a new soil structure.\"It will allow your lawn to breathe again. That job can be done pretty much any time from now up until May, when it gets too dry. You can hire a hollow tine aerator to do the job or get hold of a hand aerator which can be used on a regular basis.\"Dont fill in the holes\"A lot of people fill the holes theyve created for aeration with sand. I wouldnt do that because sand is inert - it doesnt do any good. Let the holes stay open for root development and improved drainage. You wont notice them after a few weeks, when you start to mow your grass.\"Move the goalpostsIf you have obstacles such as goalposts, trampolines or sandpits on your lawn, move themyou have space, to stop specic areas from compacting due to heavy traffic, or suffering from lack of light, he suggests.Do you need to reseed \"Scary the lawn lightly just to clean some of the dead grass out and refresh the stronger grass to recreate more growth. Ideally use a mechanical scarier,\" says Hedges-Gower. \"If you havent enough grass, you can overseed but you must create an environment to give it a good success rate.\"Pick the right seedIf youre reseeding bald patches or part of your lawn that looks a bit thin, Hedges-Gower suggests using a lawn seed mix containing ryegrass, fescue and bentgrass. But he notes you have to have the right soil conditions for any seed to be robust.Take extra measures on well-worn patches\"Ultimately,you have an area thats wearing out, its because we are walking on it and compacting it. If you cant move the goalpost or other garden toys, look at the heavy wear areas and do some more intermediate aeration on them to prevent or slow down the process of the areas wearing out,the weather suits,\" says Hedges-Gower.\"Alternatively, prick the area with a garden fork to allow the moisture to penetrate the areas to get to the roots, using the fork to about a in depth.\"Feed your lawn in spring as the nutrients from rainfall will have leached through. By May you should be reaping the benefits.\"Create a wider lawn entrance\"Remove a bit of pathway so that when you do walk on to the lawn, theres a wider area to walk on. Butyou know there are pinch points that suffer, you have to look at prevention.\"Help your lawn in autumn\"Do more to high traffic areas in autumn, which will prevent some of your problems the next spring. You may want to topdress a muddy area with sandy loam to make it less muddy in future, but you need to do that in addition to hollow tine work and aeration.\"Its all about rebalancing the growing environment. Spring and autumn are essential times to reseed. Do it as a repetition, to build the strength of your grass year on year.\"Let your grass grow longer\"The bigger cushion you can have, the stronger the plant you have and the more wear tolerance it will have, regardless of whether its a heavy wear grass or not. And feed it on a regular basis.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12279676.jpg?type=article-full","title":"coronavirus-deniers-dont-believe-covid-exists-sorry-gone-mad","story":"For many of us, braced for the next update on the death toll or front line report from an intensive care unit, it is inconceivable that people can think the pandemic is made up or exaggerated.

Nor is it linked to intelligence or education, or lack thereof. For whatever reason, baffling though it is to those of us who trust reliable sources of information, there are countless iniduals who are adamant that Covid is either a hoax, a conspiracy, or a fuss about nothing and that the vaccines are intended to wipe us out.

It is not aswe live in a chaotic or rogue state, where we have been deluged in unchallenged propaganda or starved of reliable information. Nor is that information dficult to access. Indeed, one of the most miserable aspects of the past year has been the dogged coverage of escalating tragedy: footage of mortuaries filled with the dead, of serried ranks of coffins in funeral homes, of the mortally ill saying goodbye to their loved ones from behind oxygen masks.Do Covid deniers never watch, listen or read the news, or do they tune in only to what they want to believe  Certainly, down the rabbit holes of social media it is possible to find yourself in a netherworld, so far from reality you could be a character Alice in Wonderland. Except that Alice kept her wits about her, and never lost her grip on sanity.Alarmingly, as is becoming clear, the pandemic is only the latest of the fault lines opening up between people whose world views lie at opposite ends of a spectrum.

Nor is any of us entirely immune to being manipulated by tricks or lies. You can point to the Brexiteer threats of a tsunami of immigrationwe stayed in the EU as an egregious hood, but many of those who swallowed it whole were already at a point where it merely bolstered their convictions, rather than shaped them.When it comes to medical denial, there is a long and sorry history of refusniks. Just think of John Gummer, obliging his daughter to eat a beef burger on camera to show that there was no danger of Mad Cow Disease . The government similarly played down the dangers of contracting salmonella from eggs, until Edwina Currie spoke up.The more facts and figures we are bombarded with, in our never-sleeping news cycle, the trickier it becomes to find a reasonable position between unquestioning credulity and healthy scepticism. For years it was possible to be a climate change denier, and remain intellectually credible. Now, yoursquore considered nuttyyou still donrsquot get it.What is troubling about those who refuse to believe what is happening around them, despite the evidence of their own eyes, is that it doesnrsquot make sense. It suggests wholesale disparagement, mistrust or terror of those who run the country, a determination to find hidden and sinister motives behind every announcement and regulation.Some deniers, doubtless, have no guiding principles or cosmology whatsoever, and simply prefer to ignore the wider world beyond their walls. In general, though, the level of suspicion and the passion with which untenable beliefs are held are motivated by something far stronger than lack of engagement. Discrediting Covid even when it has you in its grip denouncing global warming, despite the wildfire sweeping over your house, suggest advanced paranoia and a sense of persecution. ROSEMARY: In the footsteps of medievel pilgrimsNor is such an outlook entirely unreasonable at all times. Leadership in many countries is at worst despotic, and at the best, frequently mendacious, opaque, contradictory and evasive. Traditional media outlets deliver news that is properly researched and sourced, yet often biased in tone or emphasis. And the web is awash not just with documented fact but with misinformation that goes largely unchallenged.The fact that anyone can seriously and sustainedly deny Covidrsquos existence is merely the tip of an iceberg wersquove been trying to ignore. It is a shocking demonstration of a breakdown in societal trust and cohesion. When people refuse to acknowledge reality, and choose instead to believe what they want to believe, facts, truth, testimonies, photographic or recorded proof are cast aside as irrelevant.Despite the decline in religion in the West, maybe there is an ongoing hunger to put faith in the unprovable and intangible, an urge for creeds and a community of the likeminded based on unveriable feelings and imaginary connections. Who knows what makes people enter a parallel world to the one beneath our feet. Personally, however, I find the idea that facts and evidence no longer matter even scarier than Covid.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Its asTony Blair had sacked Gordon Brown in . It has brought to a head three isions which have shattered the unity of the Scottish National Party: the Salmond affair, the transphobia row and the lack of progress toward independence.Ms Cherry had called for Alex Salmond to be readmitted to the party after he was acquitted of all sex harassment charges last year. This did not endear her to the party leader. Next week, Mr Salmond is scheduled to give evidence to the Holyrood inquiry investigating how the Government came to lose a total of pound, fighting a doomed defence against his judicial review in . There has been a clearing of the decks in advance of this appearance, in which the former leader is expected to blow open the conspiracy he claims led to his downfall.Read more: The jury found him innocent but Alex Salmond is still on trialMs Cherry has also been an inconveniently outspoken supporter of womens rights. Indeed, she may be the first senior politician to be sacked for believing that a woman is an adult human female. She is a lesbian and a feminist who does not accept that womens sex-based rights should be sacriced on the alter of an ideology which denies that sex is binary. In short, she does not believe ldquotranswomen ARE women. For months, Ms Cherry has been the target of vilication, abuse and even death threats from numerous trans activists in and out of the party.This is such an arcane issue, baffling to the vast majority of Scottish voters, that it seems hard to believe it could have come to this. But Nicola Sturgeon has staked her reputation on driving through a new Gender Recognition Act which will allow men to self-identy, legally, as women merely by making a declaration to that effect. Last week the First Minister made a thinly-veiled attack on Ms Cherry in a video accusing her own party of transphobia. Yesterday, amendments to the much-criticised Hate Crime Bill that would have protected ldquogender-critical women like Ms Cherry from prosecution for ldquostirring up hatred were suddenly withdrawn by the Justice Secretary, Humza Yousaf.The key amendment gave freedom of speech protection to ldquodiscussion, criticism or rejection of concepts or beliefs relating to transgender identity. It also protected ldquostating that there are only two sexes and using the words ldquoman and ldquowoman to define a persons sex. The deletion of these amendments could mean that women who object to the presence of natal men in their changing rooms, or in womens sporting events, may in future be committing a criminal offence.The SNP NEC has been trying to enforce a new definition of transphobia in which even the phrase ldquoadult human female would itself be regarded as hate speech. However, it is also the dictionary definition of a woman, andquoting it is to be regarded as transphobia then there might have to be a bonfire of biology textbooks. Universities could have trouble teaching medical students about binary human reproduction.Read more: Dont tell women what makes a woman: they were born that wayMs Cherry is an experienced advocate and the best legal mind in the SNP. She took Boris Johnson to the Supreme Court in  over his prorogation of Parliament and won. In recent months she had been advocating a legal route to independence through court action on Indyref. This is a route which Ms Sturgeon has reportedly endorsed herself. So it might seem perverse to dispense with the services of the only figure in the party with the legal expertise to prosecute it. But in the SNP right now legal expertise appears to be regarded as a threat.These issues have been boiling and roiling beneath the surface of SNP politics for the last two years. The waves of scandal have been lapping around Ms Sturgeons ankles as she tries to deal with the pandemic. Now, rather like Chairman Mao in , she has decided to deal with troublesome opposition by launching a purge, and giving a green light to trans activists in her youth wing, who are highly organised on social media.There is a generational ide in the SNP. Many younger nationalists are zealous advocates of identity politics. Older, analogue politicians, like the former Justice Secretary, Kenny MacAskill tend to side with Mr Salmond and Ms Cherry. The influential Wings Over Scotland blog, penned by the Rev Stuart Campbell, which was essential reading for independence supporters in , is now calling for the resignation of Ms Sturgeon and the ldquowoke legions who are her new praetorian guard.Wings has been assisting the former British diplomat, Craig Murray, in his attempts to disclose details of the alleged conspiracy against Mr Salmond. Mr Murray is in turn defending himself against contempt of court charges relating to the Salmond trial. Another prolic SNP blogger, James Kelly of Scotland Goes Pop, has called on Mr Salmond to launch a new independence party.Like most SNP intellectuals, Mr Kelly had been arguing that it would be senseless to promote ision on the eve of a crucial election which could trigger independence. The SNP lead in the polls indicates a landslide in May. However, he now believes the situation is so dire that the two wings ndash no pun intended ndash can no longer coexist.The truth is that many in the party no longer believe that Ms Sturgeon is serious about delivering independence ndash at least not in any timescale they would regard as acceptable. Thousands have reportedly left in disgust. Ms Sturgeon dominates Scottish opinion polls and the opposition parties are disarray. Her biggest political threat now comes from within her own party.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Vessels  and , currently in some  state of unreadiness at Ferguson Marine in Port Glasgow, were supposed to address these challenges by now on the Arran and Uig-Tarbert-Lochmaddy routes.Instead, they have become symbols of what Holyroodrsquos Rural Affairs committee described as a ldquocatastrophic failure of procurement processes. The saga doubtless has a long and legalistic passage to run. Meanwhile, the islands will continue to need modern, reliable ferries.Out of this mess, it should still be possible to identy opportunity as well as catastrophe. However botched the process, too crudely tied to a short-term political imperative, the intention of building these ferries on the Clyde to save an ailing yard was honourable enough.The conclusion should not be ldquonever again so much as ldquoget it right in future. That requires a strategy rather than ad hoc actions. It needs a belief ndash self-evident where in northern Europe ndash that a nationrsquos maritime status should sustain, and be sustained by, a healthy shipbuilding sector.We will never again build great ocean liners on the Clyde but the disappearance of that tradition has been translated too easily into the shorthand that ldquoshipbuilding is finished, apart from the BAe yards tied to Ministry of Defence orders, which are secure for the next  years.But need it be like this  As the Holyrood committeersquos report put it: ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to the procurement and construction of new vessels hellip has been short-term, piecemeal and lacking in strategic direction. Change that state of affairs and a lot of opportunities arise ndash and they extend beyond CalMac ferries.It is at least possible that Brexit creates that opening. For decades, membership of the EU was blamed for our inability to use public procurement as a means of supporting our own basic industries, and none more so than shipbuilding. If that can be changed, then let us have the good grace to recognise it.From my own experience, I think the EU was more an excuse than a reason. In the CalMac case, there was a long-term civil service agenda in Edinburgh to fragment and privatise. This eventually led to the separation of infrastructure and operations, the theory being that any operator could then compete to use ferries and piers.I remember discussing this with the most senior relevant official in Brussels who insisted the Commission was not interested in Scottish ferry services but ldquo something is waved under our nose often enough we have to do something about it. So the split was created between an infrastructure companyand the operators, who have ndash despite the theology of the issue ndash continued to be CalMac.Now we are outside the EU, I would scrap CMAL and replace it with an agency with a wider remit to use public procurement to the maximum advantage of the Scottish shipbuilding and marine engineering sector ndash with the prize of industrial revival and skilled jobs in parts of Scotland, particularly the Clyde, that desperately need them.A ldquowhite paper on this theme, produced by the Glasgow-based Malin Group, estimates close on a billion pounds worth of vessels are in the Scottish public sector pipeline not just CalMac but local authority ferries, fisheries protection, Northern Lighthouse Board and so on. But how much will stay in Scotland  On current form, very little.Public procurement, their report concluded, is ldquothe essential foundation for reviving civil shipbuilding on the Clyde with all available facilities brought into play to provide the flexibility that proved to be lacking at the Ferguson yard alone.Add in the requirements of aquaculture and renewable energy, which can certainly be guided by Scottish Government policies and requirements, and the potential order book for a Scottish shipbuilding revival becomes even more promising. It is an exciting vision.However, it certainly will not happen without firm policy leadership and co-ordination. If all these public sector bodies continue to do their own thing, the opportunity will be lost. We will still be building ferries in Germany and Denmark while the industrial work-boats float over from Holland.There is responsibility too on the UK Government to make this possible. How are the terms of Brexit going to be interpreted  Are there to be new freedoms to use public procurement as the key to industrial regeneration  Andnot, then what is the point It is a classic example of why the two Governments need to work together towards a shared objective. Potential positives for the Scottish economy should not be shunned just because they can, in part at least, be attributed to leaving the EU. There are plenty disadvantages, so we might as well have some advantages also.None of this ignores the need for home-based industries to be competitive. In the longer-term, it may be unsustainable to force public bodies to pay more for vessels that could be procured from where in Europe as has become the norm. But there should surely be an opportunity to put that to the test.Scottish public procurement as the basis of a Scottish shipbuilding revival.

I donrsquot imagine our MSPs attend  hours of online parliamentary business every week in person nor via video link.Delivering learning through online classes seems archaic and little more than a virtual babysitting service quantied as ldquoeducation. Good teaching means understanding dferent learning styles, requirements and circumstances of pupils.

Private companies ask customers to be patient with staff who are operating from a working from home situation, but no similar allowance is given to teachers or pupils who have had to constantly change to the new circumstances. In addition, teachers are also dealing with their own work-from-home lives, which may include home schooling their own children. They have adapted lesson plans while simultaneously teaching, and were given notice by the Scottish Government only days before the school term was due to finish before Christmas about the sudden change in circumstances. They support children and young people by creating normality and routine to help protect their mental health against a backdrop of uncertainty and change.There must be consideration for the stress on children of learning from home, feeling overwhelmed by the volume of work. Itrsquos unrealistic to expect children to deliver a normal level of productivity when theyrsquore isolated from their peers. I know several parents who are struggling to keep their children motivated piling on school work adds to that stress for both and may result in more of these children falling further behind. There needs to be greater appreciation of the mental health impact of children to concentrate for long periods in these conditions.As a parent of a Lenzie Academy pupil, I donrsquot recognise the complaints and can only speak well of their approach. A letter was sent on January  to parents outlining the blended learning plan. The school gave adequate explanation regarding this. Through online s the teachers provide reassurance to pupils with live drop-in sessions and support and frequent pastoral care through guidance and assembly sessions.Ultimately the focus should be the quality of the work rather than the quantity.

We are about to move to Lanarkshire, where the figures show a worryingly long wait for treatment .At the beginning of April  after feeling unwell I suddenly dropped unconscious to the stone-tiled kitchen floor. An ECG reported atrial fibrillation. Two months later the cardiology specialist suggested I may have sick sinus syndrome where the heart pauses and may or may not restart.Four months on from my initial event, frustrated and very anxious awaiting further investigation, I posted a statement on the Care Opinion website. A consultant cardiologist contacted me and set up a treatment plan which involved having a cardiac monitor implanted in my chest. This monitor confirmed a few months later that indeed my heart was having short pauses and the treatment required was a pacemaker.Irsquom alive and well at present but things could have been dferentI had not had the motivation and the ability to seek help.How many people have had to wait for treatment to save their le because of a lack of funding to provide more doctors, nurses and facilities to treat cardiac disease Margaret Edwards, Bridge of Allan.WHERE ARE THEY ALL GOING WE are being encouraged to stay at home and only travel for essential purposes.

Not the vital win in a relegation battle or the wonderful team goal scored by Christopher Long, but the boot in the coupon that went unpunished.There are many truths to be garnered from this exchange. Firstly, in case my old man is reading, that of course Motherwell were robbed and it is indeed an egregious scandal. Secondly, fans still love above all  to have a right good moan about referees. And finally, that perhaps the standard of officiating in this country could do with a bit of attention.What certainly cannot be drawn from the incident is irrevocable proof that Robertson somehow has it in for Motherwell. And yet, had this incident occurred in a game involving either Celtic and Rangers, there are those who would have taken it as yet another example of institutional bias against their club from the officials, even had their own team not been involved in the game.Which brings us back to the Roofe flashpoint at Ibrox. There is a debate to be had over whether so much is made of such incidents because of the mediarsquos post-match focus on them, or whether the media focus on them because thatrsquos what the majority of fans will be talking about.Irsquom leaning towards the latter these days, as enhanced, slow-motion videos of Roofersquos tackle were plastered all over social media long before either manager had set foot in the press room. To get their tuppence-worth is only natural.Particularly in these times when fans canrsquot be at matches, the online bun-fight has replaced the post-match pint as a forum to air these grievances against officials, and it is hard not to feel at least a modicum of sympathy for referees when their every decision is scrutinised in such meticulous fashion.And for every stamp by Alfredo Morelos that goes unpunished, there is an elbow from Scott Brown that did too. For a group of supporters whose majority opinion appears to be against the introduction of VAR here after seeing what it takes away from the game down south, Scottish fans donrsquot half spend a lot of time poring over footage and highlighting whichever incidents serve to suit their own agendas.For what itrsquos worth, my opinion is that Roofe should have seen red. But then, I was able to see the tackle slowed down from three angles just by opening up Twitter, unlike referee David Munro. There didnrsquot seem to be much intent, but he does lose control and could have had no arguments had the colour of the card been dferent.Within minutes though social media was awash - with Celtic fans, in the main - demanding retrospective action and holding the video up as proof of how officials favour Rangers over them. Conveniently forgetting of course that their own team had benefitted from a couple of dubious decisions the previous night against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park, as Albian Ajeti went down like a Polaris under the slightest of attention from Killie lsquokeeper Colin Doyle to win a penalty, and Odsonne Edouard tucking away their third goal from an offside position. Ajeti, indeed, has been retrospectively charged for simulation, though Celtic plan to appeal.Fans of non-Old Firm clubs have been incredulous for years that either side of the Glasgow ide could feel hard done by when it comes to refereeing decisions, while fans of either Glasgow side are convinced they get the ndash to crudely crowbar in the word of the week again ndash jobby-covered end of the stick. Every supporter in the country could reel you off numerous occasions where decisions have gone against their team, it doesnrsquot mean there is some sort of conspiracy at play.The truth is that referees are human. They have never been under more scrutiny, and a decent case could be made that a few among their number are not quite up to scratch.The question that should be asked though is how we go about supporting those officials to improve, rather than questioning their professional integrity. Indeed, while the motives of Rangers manager Steven Gerrard may have been to protect his own player when he mentioned his desire for consistency from officials and the disciplinary process recently, surely consistency is indeed what every fan wants to see from referees.So no, John Beaton isnrsquot in the Crown Bar yucking it up about how much hersquos diddled Celtic over the years, and Willie Collum isnrsquot regaling his class with tales of sticking it to Rangers.Mistakes will always be made of course, but we should be investing in our referees to ensure that these instances become fewer and farther between.

If Scotland gets to low numbers, we should protect Scotland from importation.#If the UK gets to low numbers, we should protect the UK from importation andwe can get both islands and our surrounding islands to low numbers, we should protect that whole five countries and we should do that using vaccination, restrictions to our population and importation restrictions.”Responding to Professor Leitch’s comments, Mr McArthur said: “Where there are low levels of virus, we should be doing everything possible to keep it that way. The Northern Isles continue to see a lower prevalence compared to the Scottish mainland, and it is in everyone’s interest to keep it that way.“I have been making the case for testing ahead of travel to the islands for weeks now. So far Ministers have confirmed that the case is being considered, but no firm conclusions reached.“Professor Leitch’s intervention today strengthens that case but also reinforces the importance of putting in place appropriate protections.“I know ongoing discussions are taking place with the island authorities on a range of dferent issues. However, Scottish Ministers now need to set out how they see testing at ports and airports to work in practice.“We all want to see restrictions eased as quickly as possible but this needs to be done safely and with a continued focus on protecting the public.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There’s a whole chain of businesses in Orkney negatively affected by this.“It beggars belief that, during a pandemic and with an economic recovery effort underway in the islands, our own local authority would bypass Orkney businesses in this way, threatening local jobs in their own community.#What happened to their ‘buy local’ ethos  There’s also the issue of sustainability to think about and the impact of shipping stone all the way from Oban to Orkney, when it’s available right here on our doorstep.#Hard questions need to be asked about how a situation like this could possibly arise, particularly during a pandemic when the economic welfare of our community should be a top priority.“I’m fully aware that, by drawing attention to this issue, I’m probably doing my own business no good at all in terms of future orders from Orkney Islands Council, but this is much, much bigger than Orkney Aggregates.#This is about proper, transparent procedures and the massive, negative impact this questionable decision will have for our community.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I asked around online for ideas about what we could do to try and make it safer for otters in crossing the road.“Through Facebook I found someone on Skye who had done research on otters and there were dferent interventions for making it safe for otters to cross.”The topography and potential cost and disruption of creating a tunnel or wildle corridor under the A was ruled out leaving just a couple of options, one being a reflector system.Ms Jehu explained the remaining solutions: “One is we can ask drivers to slow down, one is to #ask# the otters to take care and that’s the one the reflectors do, it makes the otters get out of the way rather than the cars getting out of the way of the otters.“It’s very hard for car drivers to slow down on the bend, it’s dficult so they hit the otter and the speed limit is quite high there. There has been a campaign in general to lower the speed limits around Quarff. Kids cross the roads in that area too. There’s a bigger issue around road safety, for people and otters.”The system works by redirecting car headlight beams to otter eye level with the theory the bright lights will startle the otters and scare them away from the road.Ms Jehu said: “It#s been tried in other places.

In the islands, Highland and rural areas and villages across the country, BBs and self-catering properties are often the only tourism accommodation, and the spend by their guests supports these fragile economies.“The business owners on today’s webinar were understandably very concerned that the poorly-drafted ‘Short-Term Lets’ licensing legislation would be hugely onerous to microbusinesses in Skye and right across Scotland and would be a catastrophic ‘double whammy’ after these very same, small family businesses have been so disproportionately hit by Covid-.”SkyeConnect maintain that the fees for licensing accommodation with the council could be as high as £, per business. that the process to determine the fees has not been completed, and urged those affected to respond to the Parliamentary consultation before the cut-off date of this Friday. The draft regulations, published just before Christmas, will then be considered by the Local Government and Communities Committee.A spokeswoman added: “The fees are not proposed to be the subject of a statutory instrument but instead are at the discretion of each local authority to set. However, the fees must be set to ensure they are sufficient to cover the local authority’s administrative expenses.“In order to calculate this, it requires work to be carried out with our finance department as to the cost of processing and determining a licence taking into account income vs expenditure. It also requires to take into account the cost of resourcing the new licensing regime including factors such as recruiting additional staff, building and IT costs.“In terms of setting dfering levels of fees, this also needs to be assessed based on whether the processing of these applications will take longer, ie be more costly to administer.“This is an ongoing exercise and ultimately cannot be completed until the draft Regulations are finalised and we know for certain what types of letting premises will or will not be included within the licensing regime. Once this is known, it will require a paper to go to the Licensing Committee on the setting of fees for their determination.” she had “raised the concerns of constituents# with the Housing Minister Kevin Stewart. She also stressed the importance of responding to the consultation.She added: “I fully understand the concern of those across Skye and Lochalsh. In particular, I realise that the tourism industry has been through the most awful time. To that end, the deadlines associated with this have been extended to April  so that the sector has some breathing space. The purpose of the licensing scheme is a set of mandatory standards which apply to all short-term lets and I imagine that the vast majority of hosts already comply with all of these standards – and more.”A working group is currently being established to develop guidance, she said, and there will “definitely be a representative from the BB sector, as well as self-catering to “influence, inform and shape” that guidance.She also maintained that the Scottish BB Association responded to both Scottish Government consultations on the issue, in  and , and were “clear that they were in favour of levelling the playing field between BBs and properties listed on s such as Airbnb.”Ms Forbes added: “In terms of fees, there has been much concern about fees of several thousand points. The Scottish Government has not specied the specic fee level that local authorities should charge, and there is scope for local authorities to consider setting dferent fees for dferent types of short-term lets.“As the MSP for Skye and Lochalsh I will ensure that the concerns of SkyeConnect and others are passed on to those steering the legislation through parliament.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CARBOST-SHOP-1.jpg","title":"community purchase secures future for carbost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe project was delayed due to the first covid lockdown and since then the Carbost Community Shop Community Interest Company has been working hard to organise the legal side of the purchase.: “We are so pleased that everything has gone through at last and the current owner, Sharon Thacker, has been so supportive and patient during the whole process.

Officials recommended approval.A motion tabled by Skye councillor John Gordon to reject the application was seconded and supported by Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and fellow Skye councillor Calum MacLeod. It was defeated by eight votes to six.A statement on behalf of a number of Stein locals opposed to the Morgans’ development said: “Obviously, the community is shocked and deeply disappointed at the decision made at planning committee yesterday.“It is widely felt that what we are seeing is the result of a planning system that is broken. A system that has lost all integrity of intention and total collapse in community trust and respect. Everyone is talking about it.“It would seem, that a system of double standards exists, where one set of rules apply to the long-standing residents and a dferent set for the speculative, corporate developer who demonstrates no understanding interest or empathy for local heritage or the community they impose their developments on.“The progress of this application through planning has totally failed to uphold the objective of the conservation area and fails to recognise the importance of the setting of the listed building. Neither does it take account of the numerous natural heritage and wildle issues raised.”Approving the application “makes a mockery of the term conservation area and neither does the proposal comply with the terms” of Highland Council’s own local plan, the statement said.It added: “From the moment this application, with very signicant potential for detrimental impact, was accepted into the system amidst the strictest part of the pandemic lockdown, it has been felt that it sought to subvert the right of the local community to fair comment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/James-Rebanks-and-dogs-credit-Andrew-Heading-edited.jpg","title":"we can learn a lot from old henry of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineHis debut book, ‘It’s A Shepherd’s Le’ — which I stumbled on by accident— went on to become a best-seller.It’s a wonderfully evocative account of the massive challenges and privilege of being a hill farmer in the fells of the Lake District.Like all good writing, it doesn’t feel like reading you are just taken on an effortless journey of the imagination.I’ve never been to the Lake District myself, but from all accounts it’s quite spectacular — a bit like our own Highlands — and Rebanks captures that vividly.But what comes across more than anything is the sense of privilege he feels from being connected to the land, the massive challenges of trying to make a living from a harsh environment and his profound sadness that a way of le which was once the bedrock of rural communities is now fast disappearing. The parallels to our own circumstances is quite striking.His second offering, ‘English Pastoral’, offers a bit more optimism. Once again it’s a tremendously easy read and we are back on the fells, among the distinctive Herdwick sheep, the cattle, the characters — in particular his grandfather whose farm he inherited —and the drystone dykes. Except this time we are offered a lesson, and it is one that should make us sit up and take notice.Through charting the history of his home valley, Rebanks shows how agricultural practices have changed over the course of time and goes on to explain how similar trends have taken place throughout the UK and, indeed, across the globe.After the Second World War, governments rigorously pursued policies of producing more and more food. Farmers were offered huge subsidies and incentives, so farms became bigger, semi unproductive land improved through mechanisation and modern practices, and on and on the juggernaut ploughed.Then came the supermarkets. Their over-riding aim was to drive down prices, so farms had to become more efficient. Economies of scale became the mantra. Traditional family farms disappeared, swallowed up by larger businesses, machines became bigger and more expensive and farmers became captains of industry and capitalists.None of this happened overnight, of course, but it is heartbreaking to read of the struggles of the Rebanks’ own traditional family farm, trying to stay afloat financially while competing with the drive for modernisation going on all around them. The le of a hill farmer —or crofter for that matter — can seem romantic, but the reality is often very dferent.Eventually, Rebanks’ father had an epiphany – and it was something that the younger ones had also realised. And it was all to do with ‘Old Henry’.Old Henry was a neighbouring farmer, an eccentric bachelor. As all those around him invested in new machinery and chemical fertilisers, Old Henry never bothered, or even seemed to care.He just continued in his own stubborn way, farming the way it had been done for generations with native breeds of livestock, cutting hay well into the autumn , thistle and weeds adorning every nook and cranny and his old stone barns more a haven for birdle than serving any useful practical purpose.Rebanks always used to take more than a passing glance at this farm. With its vast array of wildle and ancient practices, it reminded him of the way his grandfather’s farm used to be.When Old Henry passed away, the inevitable happened and the farm was broken up and sold to larger businesses. The agronomists came with their scientic degrees to survey the land and assess what inputs were required to transform this antiquated model into profitable production. Their conclusion astounded them: never before had they seen soil so healthy. It required not a jot of chemical input.And here’s the crux of the lesson: Old Henry was onto something, whether knowingly or not. And the Rebanks were to take heed.Over the course of time, as the drive for greater efficiency became ever more necessary, farmers began to specialise in one or maybe two products – whether that was focusing on huge livestock numbers or on a particular crop. Traditional mixed rotation became a thing of the past. It was seen as unnecessary, as chemical fertilisers and pesticides could ensure continued productivity and profitability.But, through time, it all led, perhaps inevitably, to the destruction of the soil and natural environment. The evidence was there all along, but perhaps no-one had the time or inclination to see. The farmland birds — the curlew, the lapwing, the corncrake — were disappearing the earthworms, such a crucial indicator of soil health, non-existent. ‘Modernisation’ had come at a very heavy price indeed.And so the Rebanks family began to reassess. Fast-forward to today and their family hill farm now derives part of its income from subsidies geared towards environmental improvement: from the hedgerows planted, the trees, the fenced off waterways, from ious bits of wildle havens dotted around the farm.But, be under no mistake, this is still very much a working livestock business, just that the main enterprise is now dove-tailed with nature and bioersity, just as it once was through natural occurrence back in his grandfather’s day.There is a growing realisation that this is the way forward for agriculture and land use – and might even be a way of getting the wider populace to warmly embrace the countryside once again.Due to simple economics and geography, a lot of the ‘modernisation’ of which the book speaks passed crofting by, so who knows maybe we could be in the vanguard of this new agricultural and land-use enlightenment – given the proper vision and the right political will, of course.As Old Henry of the fells so ably demonstrated in his own idiosyncratic way, there’s a lot to be said for the old ways. Maybe it is time to re-connect with the past."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/363-Katherine-Dix-Ceit-at-spinning-wheel-outside-Nissen-Cottage-from-Alison-Dix-daughter-via-EM.jpg","title":"traditional journey of the swelling","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSometimes we can follow the journey of a specic story by comparing earlier texts from the great collections of the th century with later recordings, especially those in the School of Scottish Studies archives available online at the digital archive Tobar an Dualchais. We catch characters, plots and inidual episodes changing to reflect new environments, audiences and times as each version is transported by the carrying stream.How a story changes informs us about the people who tell them – their culture, beliefs, and worldview. A setting may be changed to make a story more appealing to a local audience. An episode may be omitted because it isn’t seen to be relevant – or because it is too sensitive. The same story may be repeated because it is an effective warning: be wary of the wilderness lying beyond our township’s boundary.With the help of Tobar an Dualchais, we can follow one story’s journey from Highland moor to the island of Hearmatraigh, near North Uist, in real-time. Folklorists call this kind of story a migratory legend: where the same type of story is told in dferent areas, but with dferent settings and characters, localised where it is told.Catherine Dix, or Ceit an Tàilleir, was a remarkable storyteller who contributed hundreds of items to the School of Scottish Studies Archives. Born in , Ceit spent her early le in Beàrnaraigh, before moving away for work on the mainland at the age of . After a prolonged time away, she ed with her family to the island at the start of World War Two. She was recorded extensively during the s and s.One traditional story features a shepherd and his dog who stay in a shieling overnight. A hag arrives to warm herself by the fire. She swells to the size of a peat-stack, remarking that it’s only her ‘plumage’ rising with the heat. The hag attacks the shepherd but is driven away by the dog. The story is often called ‘m’ iteagan is m’ oiteagan’ : the phrase appears in most iants of this tale.Ceit recorded the story on at least three occasions in  , and with Iain Paterson , himself a native of Beàrnaraigh employed as a collector for the School of Scottish Studies. The  recording is transcribed in the excellent  publication by Ceit’s granddaughter, Alison – Ceit an Tàilleir.Ceit clearly enjoyed telling the story, but during a decade of performances it changed its setting: from a nondescript Highland moor in , to an unnamed island in , and finally to Hearmatraigh in . A story, originally set on the mainland, is gradually reworked by the storyteller, perhaps to make it more appealing to an island audience.It’s in the nature of migratory legends to change – it’s what makes it easier for them to migrate in the first place. But can we also trace where the story came from  Where did Ceit first hear her story: in Beàrnaraigh, or where Folklore recorders are trained to ask about where tradition comes from. At the end of every story, Iain Paterson would ask Ceit where she heard the story. In , she mentioned her father, Archibald Macleodfrom Baile Mhàrtainn in North Uist. But in the  recording she offered an extra explanation: the story in fact came from Archie MacColl of Ardtur in Appin, where she worked on a farm between the ages of  and  years. Paterson, clearly intrigued, asks how the story came to be set in Hearmatraigh. Ceit replied that Archie MacColl had heard the story from a boy from the Outer Hebrides who was working for him.It’s interesting that Ceit maintained here that the story was set in Hearmatraigh in both versions she heard – the one from her father and the one she heard as a teenager working in Appin. In her first recording she had set the tale in the Highlands.By comparing this story and its episodes to similar ‘migratory legends’, we can try to trace how it might have spread. The villain of Ceit’s story is the ‘swelling hag’. This redoubtable character is met with in a type of traditional story that once was told across Eurasia. It is known by folklorists as ‘The Two Brothers’.In the Scottish Gàidhealtachd, we have a version of ‘The Two Brothers’ recorded in Beàrnaraigh. It is called ‘Cailleach na Riobaig’and was collected in  for John Francis Campbell’s ‘Popular Tales of the West Highlands’ project. Despite similar wording between the two tales, Ceit’s story contains episodes not present in the  tale, episodes resembling other versions of the story collected on the mainland, east of Appin.On the whole, Ceit’s story is more similar to these mainland versions than anything recorded in the Outer Hebrides. Although she told Iain Paterson in  that both versions of the story she had heard were set in Hearmatraigh, it may be that, to make the story more attractive to an island audience, Ceit deliberately relocated an originally mainland story to the Sound of Harris. This comes through in the changing setting of her three versions of the story.But why Hearmatraigh  In relocating her story, Ceit chose a location which preserved the kind of setting in the original mainland story. She keeps the shieling, an outpost of civilisation in the wilderness where many stories tell of conflicts between human society and the supernatural.Hearmatraigh might have been chosen as it was one of the principal islands where Beàrnaraigh folk would stay in shielings for short periods to hunt, fish, and harvest peat. One recording on Tobar an Dualchaisnotes that the bothy on Hearmatraigh was built using lime-mortar: this construction technique would have made it stand out among other island shielings built of stone and turf.The Hearmatraigh settlement was centred around the natural harbour known as An Acairseid Mhòr. It is very likely that the fishing station from the time of Charles I mentioned by the Hebridean author Martin Martinwas located here. Could the fishing station’s ruin have been later repurposed as a shieling It may be, then, that when Ceit was looking for a local setting for the story she had originally heard in Appin, moving the tale to Hearmatraigh made it more relevant and appealing to her listeners. But with this clever transfer she also skilfully preserved the cultural signicance of its original moorland setting: a place out in the wilderness where dangerous supernatural creatures could overwhelm the unwary.Ceit Dix’s stories demonstrate the richness and iety of Gaelic traditional culture and offer a glimpse of how skilled storytellers adapt and localise their tales to entertain and intrigue their dferent audiences. contains some , oral recordings of songs, music, poetry and factual information made in Scotland and further afield."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3602630.jpg--.jpg?1612358530000\n","title":"great donation from vincent and his band of kitchen quizzers","story":"‘VINCENT’S Kitchen Quizzes’ has raised over pound for Northern Ireland Hospice .Vincent Rainey, the man behind the ongoing and highly popular general knowledge testing sessions, recently presented a cheque for pound to Emma Henry, a volunteer from the Ballymena Hospice Support Group.In an effort to ease boredom and raise spirits in these unprecedented times Vincent has been running quizzes every weekend since March last year.

There is a carefully rehearsed procedure of name taking, mask changing and hand sanitising at the initial entry point where these vital duties are among the many roles taken up by volunteers such as Arthur Halligey who was the first greeter on Friday morning.Arthur, part of the Volunteer Now group, is just one of an army of citizens doing their best to help out with the operation and their dedication and community spirit has been hailed as vital by Sinead OKane, Assistant Director of Governance and Risk Management - essentially the woman who is charged with keeping the process running smoothly.A good description for Sinead would be a cocktail of irrepressible energy mixed with an indefatigable sense of humour.Sinead is obviously very serious about her role and she has her fair share of stories about her experiences during the course of the pandemic, but when this grim periodfades sooner rather than later, Ill take a bet that her motivational skills will live long in the memory of all those she has worked with.And like all good leaders, she knows the worth of all those around her who have thrown their energies into the process.IN IT TOGETHERSineads team really does bring meaning to that somewhat cliched phrase of were all in it together - in their case it has never been more important to be all in.From the start this has been a massive logistical operation with literally every department doing their umost to provide this service.I cannot speak highly enough of these people. Everyone - volunteers, the administrative staff and of course the nurses, midwives, Allied Health Professionals and NIAS and support services have really been all hands to the pumps , she says.The timetable for vaccinations is, of neccessity, honed down to a fine art. We estimate that from entry to exit, the process lasts around  minutes - and half of that is spent seated post-jab as a precaution on carefully cleaned chairs adjacent to the exit where recipients receive their final documentation.Behind the scenes, the flow of the all important vaccine is controlled by a team of pharmacists under Deputy Head of Pharmacy for the Trust, Stephanie Tohill, who reiterates Sineads words on the united effort.I’ve got the greatest respect for everyone involved, she says. Hard to believe weve been doing this for six weeks and we have a long way to go as we move through the ious age groups.So what does this monumental operation come down to  Saving lives is the very obvious answer. Protecting health and social care services is another major factor.But Sinead, in typical fashion, boils it all down to one word - people.Im sometimes almost overwhelmed by the reactions we get from the people who pass through. “They are so kind with their words and their support.The one incident that really sticks in my mind is a conversation I had with a gentleman on palliative care who received his vaccination.He looked at me and thanked us all, saying this means I dont have to die alone. That hit hard.But then she added with typical humour: In fact he ended up having to console me!In a pandemic riddled with cliches theres one that holds very true. If you didnt laugh, youd cry.Lets all hope that the efforts of all those behind the operation at the Seven Towers Leisure Centre bring some much needed fun and laughter into all our lives.

It was a sad time but after a lot of Bible reading and reflection I came up with the idea of trying to help others in some small way.And since then, the Harryville woman has held fast to that idea based on her Christian faith.HUMBLEDDoreen says she has been humbled by some of the experiences she has enjoyed as a result - especially at Christmas time when the seat is laid out with ious toys.There are people out there with children who dont have enough money to buy the things they want to give.

I knew they were feeling awkward so I went out and explained why the toys were there. The man told me that he had lost his job and money was pretty tight so I asked the childhe wanted any of the items.The wee fella chose a toy car - just a wee cheap thing - and he seemed pleased. He told me really wanted a set of roller blades for Christmas but I could tell from the fathers face that the cash wasnt there to pay for such things. Off they went and I never thought much about it until a few days later I came out of the house to find a set of roller blades on the seat.That can happen from time to time. People leave stuff knowing it will go to someone who needs it. Other people send me parcels of things to set out and Id like to thank all those who do so.When I saw the roller blades I was amazed and I was even more amazed when the man came up to the house that day and told me that something had spurred him to come by.I pointed at the roller blades and the look on that mans face was wonderful to see.

Skerry Road East, perhaps the least busy road in Northern Ireland, is part of the Dungonnell Trail but it also runs past the evidence of this area’s industrial past.If you’ve ever driven out of Cargan and on towards Cushendall and Waterfoot you will have seen the signs of railway lines in the valley below.The article below, which sets this story in context, first appeared in its entirety in The Glynns Volume and is currently hosted online via the website of the Glens of Antrim Historical Society. It is drawn from the ‘Iron Mines of Glenravel’ by Kevin J. O’Hagan“Within the last two years an extensive and valuable iron mine was discovered at Glenravil about  miles from Ballymena by James Fisher Esq. of Cleggan Lodge near this town and of Barrow-in-Furness, Lancashire. Under the energetic management of this enterprising gentleman it was opened about  months ago.”So read the editorial of the Ballymena Observer, Saturday, July th, , commemorating the opening of the first of the Glenravel iron ore mines.Just three weeks earlier Mr. Fisher himself had given an open-air party for about fty gentlemen friends on the mountainside near the mine. It was an unusual repast, but no more unusual than the event it commemorated for here, in one of the bleakest, most barren and out-of-the-way places in the country, rich seams of iron ore had been found and mud-stained miners were raising  tons of top quality ore per week.This situation could hardly have been envisaged a few years earlier, not even by Fisher. Others before him were aware of the existence of iron-bearing rock but failed to exploit it or to locate the richer seams.The first had been Nicholas Crommelin, who, in , in his task of settling the area and building the village which bears his name, found a sample of the ore.He had it analysed by Professor John F. Hodges who found it to contain from  to % peroxide of iron. Crommelin’s enthusiasm got the better of him and he set about building a furnace to smelt the ore using the local peat for firing.He made repeated attempts to smelt the ore and succeeded in obtaining some metallic iron but the dficulties were so great that he abandoned the idea altogether.His furnace still stands near the village of Newtowncrommelin, a monument to his endeavours.Some years later Hodges was again called to examine some specimens in the possession of Edward Benn, the Glenravel landlord.These were obviously much richer specimens than Crommelin’s for Hodges was now convinced that valuable deposits lay hidden in the Glenravel mountains.Benn had his ore smelted by a local smith, John McAlister of Legegrane, who managed to produce a small sample of iron.This was then taken to Rowan’s foundry in Belfast where it was mistakenly identied as having been produced from the best Swedish ore.This was praise indeed but it seems strange that Benn himself took his discovery no further.Perhaps he was deterred by the failure of ious other projects with which he was connected — the distillation of alcohol and the distillation of paraffin — and was reluctant to invest money in any new venture.At any rate, it wasn’t until the arrival of James Fisher on the scene that mining the ore became a serious proposition.Credit for the initiation of the successful exploitation of the mineral wealth of this area is traditionally given to the parish priest of the time, Rev. Wm. John Macauley. He was a keen rambler and interested in geology and he was aware that the home-based linen industry, by which the majority of his parishioners lived, was in decline owing to the rise of the large spinning mills.His parish included the Braid and no doubt because of this he became acquainted with James Fisher who was then residing at Cleggan House, the property of Lord O’Neill.When a parishioner showed Father Macauley a piece of red rock he had found, Mr. Fisher was immediately contacted for Fisher already had mining interests in N. W. England, an iron ore producing region.The pair of them then set off on an exploration trip to Ballynahavla, near Cargan accompanied by two other men, one of whom had found the ore in the first place.They went almost directly to the spot and lting back a piece of overhanging turf discovered a seam two feet thick. They at once proceeded to Glenravel House to see Edward Benn who encouraged them to investigate further and gave Fisher permission to dig for a year at a rent of pound. The stage was thus set for one of the greatest industrial booms of the century which was to last nearly  years.In  Fisher began by outcrop digging or opencast mining at a place known as the Gullets, on the slopes of Slievenanee, and in the first six months was able to ship , tons of ore to England worth about pound per ton. It was not long, however, before he realised that more and better ore lay within the outcrop and he began to drive adits.The first underground mine to be opened was aptly named the Glenravel mine, situated in the townland of Legegrane on the south slope of Slievenanee.This was in January . Soon, other enterprising gentlemen began to take note, among them Silas Evans who laid the foundations of the Antrim Iron Ore Company which quickly took up large parcels of the country.There was a great influx of people into the area and several mining villages sprang up, chief among them Fisherstown, named after James Fisher, but now with the uninteresting name of Cargan.The ordinary farm workers of the area took to the novel type of employment and soon acquired the new skills of mining.Wages of  - per week in  rose in  to  - and  - per week for underground workers and to  - and  - per week for surface workers. By  there were about  men employed directly in the mines and  horses were being used in carting away the ore. To facilitate this Fisher had built his own tramway which ran from the Gullets to Parkmore, a distance of two miles.There was as yet no narrow-gauge railway from Ballymena.Most of the miners were labourers and small farmers and the owner of a small farm could even do part-time work at the mines when farming conditions permitted.This helped to supplement his farm income. This new-found source of wealth led to a rather unruly sort of le and drinking sprees and brawls were common.Fisherstown was so wild that children were not allowed on the street when the miners were in town — a situation more akin to the Wild West in the goldrush days.At the start of mining operations levels were driven generally two or three at a time. A connecting passage was then cut to join these levels together to provide a cir-culation of air to the miners and to disperse explosive fumes.From this stage the mine was extended horizontally generally following the ore seam and this gave rise to the term — the Longwall method — literally along the wall of the passage. As soon as a sound roof was met with, side roads were driven right and left and from these the working areas branched off approximately  yards apart. In these areas the miner excavated the ore with a pick and shovel in a cramped and awkward position lying on his side. He removed the ore and waste rock in a wide circular sweep andthe roof was thought to be unstable or unsafe he left pillars of rock standing to support it. This method of mining was known as the ‘room and pillar’ and many examples of it are still visible today in these mines.Probably early in the process rails were laid into the mine to provide a means of removing the waste rock as well as the ore. For this reason the main adit was driven  feet high by  feet wide to accommodate a double line of rails. Alternatively,a single line was considered sufficient or the level was for ventilation only, e.g. an air drt, it was driven only  feet wide. As the workings progressed the waste rock within the mine was used to block off workings which became exhausted or to support the roof in place of the ore which had been removed.The miners worked on a sht system so that they would not be mining ore all day.This meant that they worked half the day in the mine digging ore and the other half on the surface loading it or doing some other job. They would be replaced at the ore face by other miners who had been on the surface during the morning sht.The hours in the Glenravel mines were  a.m. to  p.m. By the early ’s several mines were being worked — Fisher at Slievenanee, the Crommelin Mining Co. at Tuftarney, the Antrim Iron Ore Co. at Cargan and Dungonnell and Mr. Charles Chambers and the Evisnacrow Iron Co. at Evishnacrow. Mining had also extended to other areas, namely Parkmore, Glenarf, Rathkenny, Carncormick and Broughshane.Up to this time the mines had been worked solely for iron ore. Aluminium was still a virtually unknown commodity and it was only in  that it was realised it could be obtained from bauxite.In fact, these minerals, aluminium and iron, are two of the most common elements of the Earth’s crust between them making up nearly % of the total composition. It is no coincidence, therefore, that the ores of these metals, bauxite and iron ore, formed by the prolonged weathering of basalt lavas, are found side by side in the Antrim hills.It was Professor Hodges again who, probably because of his familiarity with the ores of the district, discovered bauxite in the Cargan Mine in .This discovery added more interest and potential to the mining industry and boosted out-put from the mines for several years. During these years too the narrow-gauge railway had arrived, reaching Cargan in May  and Retreat in October . Branch lines were laid to the ious groups of mines and these facilitated the ore being removed quickly from the mines to Ballymena and thence to Larne for shipment.The Wire Tramway, an overhead bucket system built in  for transporting the ore from Cargan to Red Bay, had come and gone, having been sabotaged on the night of Sunday, July th  and never repaired. Nevertheless, mining then even as today was dependant on an efficient means of getting ore away quickly. The railway encouraged expansion in the mining industry and made the ore more valuable because it was more accessible.However, in the early ’s, due to a slump in the iron industry in Britain and the exhaustion of the better-classores, production started to dwindle. The production of bauxite continued and some mines went over completely to the mining of bauxite e.g. Tuftarney and Evishnacrow mines, the latter being worked up to . Iron ore production carried on at a reduced pace in most of the mines and towards the turn of the century the Crommelin company even opened a series of new mines along the east side of the Skerry Water and two bauxite mines on the west side.In general, however, the number of working adits steadily declined and desperate ef-forts were sometimes called for to prolong mining, e.g. at the Cargan Mine where numerous volcanic dykes displaced the ore seam, the miners had to bore their way through  feet of solid rock in an attempt to locate the seam but had to give up. Three of the five adits were soon to be closed but in , in attempting to reopen one of them, an additional problem was encountered for the mine was by this time flooded.In , a prophetic writer, R. A. Watson, in an article in the Dublin University Magazine, made the comment that it would take some hundreds of years before these ore deposits would become exhausted, but sadly prophesy and actuality are seldom one and the same. All mining enterprises have to be abandoned sooner or later either because the deposits are exhausted or their extraction no longer pays. Mining, therefore, must eventually disappear from any area since it is only a temporary form of occupation. It is a natural progression. It took Nature millions of years to produce these minerals and what the miners removed in a few short decades cannot be replaced.The mines eventually closed and no one is really to blame. Various factors contributed to the decline, one of the main ones being the unfavourable dip of the ore seam which often caused flooding.Fisher’s mines, the original Glenravel Mines closed on --  because the best quality ore had been worked out and the second quality was considered uneconomical to work. Adits  and  of the Evisnacrow Mines were last worked on -- and closed because of the company’s inability to work them at a profit.The British Portland Cement Manufacturing Co. took over the bauxite mine here in  but the bauxite proved unsuitable for their purpose and the mine was abandoned on --. The Dungonnell Mines were subject to flooding but they were abandoned in  because of disagreements between the mining company and the leaseholders. The Crommelin Co. too was plagued by flooding problems as well as the ore failing but still managed to excavate an exten-sive series of workings at Skerry East, many of which are still accessible.Quite apart from these reasons there are three other factors which contributed to the closure of the mines.Firstly, there were no smelters in Co. Antrim and the ore had to be shipped to mainland Britain.Secondly, the quality of the iron ore was not good enough for smelting on its own — it had to be mixed in the furnaces with other richer, imported ores. The bauxite, too, was not entirely suitable for the manufacture of aluminium and only a small proportion was used for this purpose. Imported bauxite was cheaper and more suitable and so the demand for Antrim bauxite declined.Thirdly, the high cost of transport from the mines to the smelters and processing plants left little profit for the mining companies.Although the mining industry in Glenravel appeared to have died prematurely it was not forgotten. With the outbreak of World War Two a new crisis loomed in the shape of U-boats and it became increasingly dficult to obtain foreign bauxite.In  Lord Beaverbrook announced to the nation that there was a scarcity of aluminium, and aluminium was a vital ingredient in the manufacture of war planes.By this time Germany was producing about % more aluminium than the USA because of her control of Aluminium-producing countries. So it was that interest in the Antrim bauxites was rekindled and this led to re-investigation of local reserves. In  new bauxite mines were opened at Newtowncrommelin known as the Skerry Mines.Other abandoned workings were reopened for their bauxite content and many Glenravel miners and sons of miners were recruited to work in the new mines. Many travelled daily to work in the vast labyrinth at Lyle’s Hill, Templepatrick.The Skerry Mines closed early in  and mining as an industry finally ceased on --.

The marriage took place in  at Full Sutton Prison while they were serving terms in separate prisons in England, both convicted of being involved in IRA bombing campaigns on the UK mainland.Mr Kavanagh had also previously served as special adviser to former Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness.In  he won compensation after losing his role as a special adviser after a bill drafted by TUV leader Jim Allister prevented anyone with a criminal record from holding the position.At the time Mr Kavanagh said the Bill victimised former prisoners, especially members of Sinn Fein.“Twenty years into a peace process and the victimisation goes on and we’re still going to exclude people ” he said.“Exclusion was part of the problem that we had and why we ended up in conflict. Is the message out there, that’s what we’re going back to, exclusion.“I worked in the community and voluntary sector for seven years before coming to the Assembly, working with some of the most deprived communities, trying to help build a better society.“Ex-prisoners are saying to me `why are we being victimised’ ”In making the announcement of new EA membership, the Department of Education said: “Mr Kavanagh brings to the board of the EA experience of communication and influencing skills, developing and maintaining co-operative working relationships within a corporate governance framework and analytical ability and decision making as a school Governor.“He has experience of budgetary management in an organisational environment.“Mr Kavanagh has declared that during the last five years he has undertaken political activity for Sinn Fein and canvassed on behalf of the party, or helped at elections.”TUV leader Jim Allister said the appointment sends a dreadful message to a new generation of children.DUP East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell said there would be anger at Sinn Fein’s decision to nominate the convicted bomber.A Sinn Fein spokesperson said: “Paul Kavanagh has a wealth of experience in education, government and policy development.”A spokesperson for the Department of Education said: “Under the Education Act ,  board members are appointed directly by the Department of Education with the remaining  Board members appointed directly by political parties in accordance with the D’Hondt principles.“Under this legislation, political members are not ministerial appointments and as such the Minister and Department have no role in the nomination process.“The Minister is informed by the relevant political party that the member is in post, having confirmed to the Department that they wish to take up office following nomination in accordance with Schedule , Paragraph .”Some parents at Lumen Christi College were angered when Mr Kavanagh was proposed as a member of the Board of Governors at the Londonderry School in , a position he has held for the last nine years.At the time of his appointment to the Board of Governors at Lumen Christie College, Sinn Fein said Mr Kavanagh had made a signicant contribution to his community over many years.“This has included spending over four years as a governor of a local school in Derry,” the party said.“Republican ex-prisoners have played a signicant role in the development of the peace process and in community development work within the areas where they live.“Those involved in this work should be encouraged not demonised.”Two other people were killed by the IRA unit in which Mr Kavanagh was a member.Nora Field and John Breslin were civilians caught up in the explosion at the headquarters of the Irish Guards, in October .Also nominated for EA positions by Sinn Fein were Angela Mervyn, currently employed by the West Belfast Partnership Board in the role of Education Programmes Manager and Frank Maskey, recently retired as Principal of Corpus Christi College.Gillian McGrath, recently retired Director of Education in the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, was nominated by the NI Commission for Catholic Education to represent the interests of trustees of maintained schools.The Board is made up of  members, some nominated by political parties. The EA is responsible for the delivery of education services throughout Northern Ireland.Belfast Top VideosVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanVideoWatch: The moment a tractor crashes into Co Fermanagh homeMost ReadSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Convicted IRA bomber Paul Kavanagh appointed to Education Authority Coronavirus Northern Ireland:  further deaths reported as care home vaccinations almost completeEast Belfast show of strength #an attack on the Ogle family#NI health trust confirms number of Covid- vaccine doses wastedLatest EducationNI students to get £ Covid- paymentNI student medics to miss out on £k Covid recognition bonus given to health service trainees Dodds to meet Irish education minister over NI students taking part in ErasmusMinister Weir accused of #hissy fit# over Welsh exam board decision affectiing Northern Ireland pupilsLatest from Belfast Century for Joe Root in his th Test as England make strong start in IndiaJosh Van Der Flier in reshuffled Ireland back row following Caelan Doris injuryTens of thousands rally in support of Nepal’s embattled PMTyson Fury-Anthony Joshua announcement close, claims Eddie HearnTwo women killed and man dies in crash in ‘linked’ incidents,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Northern Ireland#s decline compared with a % year on year fall across the UK which marked the worst January since .It is now six years since car sales here had signicantly increased - a trend which would hit the second-hand market. He added: The fall in new car sales over the last few years, and particularly last year, will reduce the supply of vehicles into the used car market.  was the last year that NI posted a meaningful increase in new car sales with registrations down % since then. It remains to be seen whether the new car sales market can reverse its recent decline in  and climb the priority spending list for consumers.Karen Johnson, head of retail and wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, said selling online had not been enough to halt the drop in new registrations.Lessons learned from the first lockdown have seen traders bolstering their e-commerce propositions to meet the changing purchasing habits of the consumer, selling cars via delivery and on a #click and collect# basis, but their valiant efforts fell short last month.As well as a desire to see forecourts reopening sooner rather than later as we move further into , sellers will also be looking to those consumers who have built up savings during the pandemic to start committing again to big ticket purchases like a new car.Although the industry is still producing high quality vehicles and is doing its best to stimulate demand with attractive financing deals, concerns still abound re the infrastructure needed to support dferent fuel types.Ms Johnson said more charge points were needed for a rise in sales of alternatively-fuelled cars.She added: Consumer demand for the next generation of vehicles with low or zero emissions is undoubtedly muted due to the underlying caution around the well-publicised roll out of charging points - particularly in rural areas. Northern Ireland has the lowest number of charging points per capita than any other region in the UK, so it is clear more must be donesales are to gather pace in the next few years.Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said it was a bad start to the year for the industry, which lost £.bn in sales last year. He added: The necessary lockdown will challenge society, the economy and our industry#s ability to move quickly towards our ambitious environmental goals.

Now he has decided to tackle the man he considers the greatest to have ever played the game.The book, which has the backing of the Best family, features wide-ranging interviews with George#s loved ones, team-mates and friends.The foreword is provided by George#s brother Ian and brother-in-law Norman McNarry.Much has been written about Best#s rise from the Cregagh estate to the top of the footballing world. The controversial star was followed by the media throughout his le, his every move documented in column inches. Mr Barton said he wanted to get away from the stories of drinking and womanising and concentrate on George Best the footballer. Best died as a result of alcoholism in November . Before his death he asked that people remember me for my football.I#ve talked to so many people while writing my other books, many of them tell stories about George Best, it#s just mesmeric from my point of view, said the author. I#m a United fan, I#ve seen all the tapes and everything of George, and I always felt that George was the best player we#ve ever had.I feltI was going to do something about him I#d have to come up with something dferent than everything that#s been written.I thought the one thing that was missing, as stupid as it sounds, was a book about George the footballer. He said he doesn#t shy away from the negative aspects of George#s le when it pertains to football.They are such prominent things in his le you can#t completely pretend that it doesn#t exist, that wouldn#t do his story justice, he explained.Mr Barton referred to the story of the hotel bellboy who delivered champagne to Best#s room and found him with a scantily-clad Miss World on a bed covered with his winnings from the casino. The bellboy asked Best: #Where did it all go wrong # Mr Barton said it has become a bit of a punch line, but he hopes to understand Best#s mindset.The writer said that during his research he discovered the true story behind the star#s exit from Old Trafford.He left the club in January  amid a turbulent season that saw United relegated just a few years after their  European Cup triumph. Mr Barton used information published in this newspaper at the time to uncover the story. It#s never been documented before, it#s been said he came into the stadium drunk, but I have found a lot of stuff that rubbishes that story and clears George#s name, he said.It#s dficult to say when it#s your own work, but I think it#s the biggest untold story in United history.My motivation was not only to tell the story about George, but make sure that I was being true to him. Rather than just telling a story about a famous player, I wanted to make sure I was being loyal to the way he would have wanted it to be told.With his birthday coming up I imagined the book would be a positive celebration of George#s le, and I think I#ve achieved that.Belfast Top VideosVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanVideoHealth Minister says more than , vaccines administeredMost ReadSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Convicted IRA bomber Paul Kavanagh appointed to Education Authority East Belfast show of strength #an attack on the Ogle family#NI health trust confirms number of Covid- vaccine doses wastedCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  further deaths reported as care home vaccinations almost completeLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland#s weekly Covid- death rate falls as toll hits ,Man stabbed in the face in Newry attackN Ireland’s weekly Covid- death toll fallsIt makes the game easy, says NI golf pro after McIlroy hits out at #waste of time# report on long drivesRevealed: How PSNI monitors politicians, journalists and public social media activityLatest from Belfast Northern Ireland#s weekly Covid- death rate falls as toll hits ,New Dancing On Ice star Matt Richardson says training left him with concussionAll adults over  should receive coronavirus vaccine by May, Government saysUp to m pints of beer thrown away since pandemic started, industry body claimsRoyal Marines brave Arctic temperatures on winter training exercise in Norway,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The South Eastern Trust said that  doses of a Covid- vaccination session were recorded as wastage.The health trust covers a wide-range of medical facilities outside of Belfast including hospitals in Lisburn Castlereagh, Ards and North Down, and Newry Mourne and Downe.A spokesperson for the trust said the  doses of the vaccine were wasted due to particulates in the vial after reconstitution or spray back when diluting the vial.The most recent wastage came on Wednesday January  due to spray back whilst diluting.Health chiefs at the trust say they’ve reviewed their existing processes to ensure the continued minimisation of waste.A South Eastern Trust spokesperson said: “The trust ensures good communication between the vaccination centre and pharmacy team to determine the correct amount of vaccine which needs to be ordered and prepared for administration.“Robust competency training of all new vaccinators and standard operating procedures also ensures staff are fully competent in preparation and administration of the vaccine to minimise any wastage.“In the care home setting the trust liaises closely with care home managers to determine the number of residents and staff able to avail of the vaccine and plans with the pharmacy team to ensure the correct amount of vaccine is ordered.“Procedures are in place in both the care home setting and vaccination centre to have staff available to receive any planned doses of vaccine which could not be administered due to planned patients being unable to receive the vaccine.”Belfast Top VideosVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanVideoWatch: The moment a tractor crashes into Co Fermanagh homeMost ReadSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Convicted IRA bomber Paul Kavanagh appointed to Education Authority Coronavirus Northern Ireland:  further deaths reported as care home vaccinations almost completeEast Belfast show of strength #an attack on the Ogle family#NI health trust confirms number of Covid- vaccine doses wastedLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland#s weekly Covid- death rate falls as toll hits ,Man stabbed in the face in Newry attackN Ireland’s weekly Covid- death toll fallsIt makes the game easy, says NI golf pro after McIlroy hits out at #waste of time# report on long drivesRevealed: How PSNI monitors politicians, journalists and public social media activityLatest from Belfast Tens of thousands rally in support of Nepal’s embattled PMTyson Fury-Anthony Joshua announcement close, claims Eddie HearnTwo women killed and man dies in crash in ‘linked’ incidentsCovid- vaccines used across the UK are safe, new MHRA analysis showsBridgerton’s Rege-Jean Page: Intimacy co-ordinator took ‘risk’ out of sex scenes,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The information was obtained through a Freedom of Informationrequest by investigative website The Detail.In a statement to the website, the PSNI admitted thatpeople knew the police were treating their social media activity in this way, it could negatively affect their mental and physical health.The PSNI’s Strategic Communication and Engagement Department was asked to produce all social media monitoring reports they had compiled in a one-year period.Hundreds of pages with heavily redacted material was provided - but many were entirely blacked out. Police redacted all posts made by members of the public on social media. The only posts shown were either made by official PSNI social media accounts and occasionally by media outlets or public bodies. The PSNI said it engages in the practice of monitoring and reporting on the public’s social media activity to “measure sentiment in the community”.However, the service also acknowledged that when people “made social media posts which are either critical or supportive of policing they would not expect their social media posts to be gathered as discussion points on PSNI social media reports”.Some examples of the police’s commentary on social media posts included a photojournalist complaining about the number of times he was stopped by police each day for questions, graffiti about Prime Minister Boris Johnson and a tweet from a youth claiming he was attending to attend a bonfire.There were also reports on tweets regarding an incident in the Markets area of Belfast which claimed that police were ignoring certain areas during the pandemic and reaction to a republican activist being stopped and searched by an officer.However, none of the documents included any social media reaction to high profile cases involving the PSNI, such as the death of Noah Donohoe, the funeral of Bobby Storey and the arrests of journalists Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey over their No Stone Unturned Loughinisland documentary.Very few references were made to the PSNI’s handling of the Black Lives Matters protests.The PSNI said in its FoI response that the reason for redacting a large amount of material was that the service has a duty of care to “ensure that the physical and mental health of those iniduals are safeguarded by not releasing any material that could point to the originator of the post”.They added that some of the information could endanger iniduals.The PSNI said it has been monitoring and internally reporting on social media posts since .A PSNI spokesperson stated the purpose of the service’s social media monitoring and internal reporting “is to gain better understanding of community feeling in relation to policing and police activity so that the service can identy issues, concerns and successes to inform, enhance and improve their service”.Belfast Top VideosVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanVideoHealth Minister says more than , vaccines administeredMost ReadSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Convicted IRA bomber Paul Kavanagh appointed to Education Authority East Belfast show of strength #an attack on the Ogle family#NI health trust confirms number of Covid- vaccine doses wastedCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  further deaths reported as care home vaccinations almost completeLatest Northern IrelandMan stabbed in the face in Newry attackN Ireland’s weekly Covid- death toll fallsIt makes the game easy, says NI golf pro after McIlroy hits out at #waste of time# report on long drivesCycling survey sparks calls for better infrastructureLatest from Belfast All adults over  should receive coronavirus vaccine by May, Government saysUp to m pints of beer thrown away since pandemic started, industry body claimsRoyal Marines brave Arctic temperatures on winter training exercise in NorwayFormer Greene King boss launches pub venture with £m investmentWhat could European football look like from  ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Last night Sir Tom#s memory was marked with a national clap.In Belfast, the Lord Mayor opened an online book of condolence.

The Western Trust received £, from his efforts and the Southern Trust received £,. What a treasure he was. It is disappointing and I know other people who would call themselves nationalists or republicans actually did pay tribute.He added: They [SF] probably had their own reasons for doing it.During the meeting, Ulster Unionist councillor Victor Warrington said: The man was a great inspiration at the start of this pandemic, with his efforts of doing the walk to raise millions for the NHS. He had a great le of  years and would have had some great stories to tell. On behalf of my party, I want to express our sincere sympathies.This was followed by a tribute from Mr Thompson of the DUP.Independent councillor Emmet McAleer said: The money that Captain Sir Tom raised during his activities was absolutely inspiring.Independent councillor Josephine Deehan told members she was greatly saddened.Another independent, Donal O#Cofaigh, referred to Sir Tom#s inspirational efforts.SDLP councillor Paul Blake said he was a real inspiration, adding: We owe a great debt of gratitude.Yesterday, hours before a national clap in his memory took place, the House of Commons fell silent in tribute to Sir Tom.Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs the centenarian had dedicated his le to serving the needs of so many others. He said: We all now have the opportunity to show our appreciation for him and all that he stood for and believed in. That is why I encourage everyone to join in a national clap for Captain Tom and all those health workers for whom he raised money at pm this evening. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Captain Tom#s contribution - having raised more than £m for the NHS during the first coronavirus lockdown - will be formally marked, possibly with a statue.Belfast Top VideosVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanVideoWatch: The moment a tractor crashes into Co Fermanagh homeMost ReadSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Convicted IRA bomber Paul Kavanagh appointed to Education Authority Coronavirus Northern Ireland:  further deaths reported as care home vaccinations almost completeEast Belfast show of strength #an attack on the Ogle family#NI health trust confirms number of Covid- vaccine doses wastedLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland#s weekly Covid- death rate falls as toll hits ,Man stabbed in the face in Newry attackN Ireland’s weekly Covid- death toll fallsIt makes the game easy, says NI golf pro after McIlroy hits out at #waste of time# report on long drivesRevealed: How PSNI monitors politicians, journalists and public social media activityLatest from Belfast Northern Ireland#s weekly Covid- death rate falls as toll hits ,New Dancing On Ice star Matt Richardson says training left him with concussionAll adults over  should receive coronavirus vaccine by May, Government saysUp to m pints of beer thrown away since pandemic started, industry body claimsRoyal Marines brave Arctic temperatures on winter training exercise in Norway,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The site has lain empty since  but in recent days trees and weeds that had grown over time were removed. A planning application was previously lodged for the construction of  residential apartments which will comprise of  one bed and  two bed apartments.

If approved, people will be able to gain access to the apartments from Foyle Roadand John Street.  There will also be a ground floor parking area that can accommodate  cars. The accommodation is viewed as a good location for non-car use and car ownership will be being actively discouraged at the site. A Travel Plan will be promoted by a ‘Travel Coordinator’ who will promote other forms of transport. A document accompanying the application, states: “The measures will encourage the use of sustainable modes, reduce dependence on the car and therefore contribute to reduced car growth in car journeys, increase the use of healthier alternatives such as walking and cycling, and contributing towards making a safer, healthier environment around the development.” googletag.cmd.push A report also highlights the servicing arrangements for the building which sits close to the bottom deck of the Craigavon Bridge. It identies the challenges posed by vehicles collecting or delivering goods to the apartments but deems these activities to be ‘low-impact’, aside from removal vehicles, which was categorised as ‘medium impact’ – but something that will happen ‘once a year’. The site was formerly occupied by Hamilton  Sons factory which was demolished in . At the time there were concerns about the stability of the building, which had been derelict for years. Foyle Civic Trust was disappointed by the decision, saying that everything should be done to save the industrial heritage of the city.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Extremely quiet. The other places Ive visited have been quiet, but not to this extent. Just like it takes your eyes a while to adjust to new light,you wait long enough, things come into focus. A Claudy Fuels lorry roars past and when it clears, there is movement. A young boy in Banagher gear emerges from the Spar shop clutching a plastic bag. He hasnt far to go, and with a quick look either way, darts across the road and disappears into a house on Feeny Road. At its heart, Feenys main thoroughfare is a residential street, and the people who live there are staying at home. googletag.cmd.push Walking up the hill towards the GAA pitch, the sun briefly illuminates figures at windows. An elderly man squints against the sun as he peers out his window. I catch glimpses of home-schooled children appearing at the windows as I make my way past. The distinctive air brake of the bin lorry comes at regular intervals. One woman rushes from her house with a bin in tow, spinning it on the kerb before retreating back into her home. Covid- messaging on the gates of Fr McNally Park. Smoke from internal fires wafts through the air as I reach Fr McNally Park, where the sun is breaking through the haze to create a spectacular backdrop. googletag.cmd.push The pitch is the first place of note you reach when you enter Feeny. It acts almost as a gatekeeper for the village, but its own gates are open. There dont appear to be any walkers on the grounds though, and I head back towards the centre of the village, where cars are parked around its hub the pharmacy, supermarket and chippy. A man stops me in the pharmacy car park, askingI know where he can find the boy that does the tarmac – McCloskey. Its as near to the needle in a haystack conundrum as you will find. I wish him luck.     Outside Feeny pharmacy, a makesht shelter has been erected to facilitate a socially distanced queue, but there is none today. Local pharmacist Declan Bateson believes people are taking things seriously. Owner Declan Bateson tells me this lockdown has been much quieter than its predecessors. “After Christmas, its been quieter. People are taking it seriously and have seen the surge in the hospitals,” says the  All-Ireland winner. “In the run-up to Christmas it was very busy. Retail shops were closed for a while and with the pharmacy being allowed to stay open, it meant we were busier. “GPs have tightened up who can come and theyve had a lot less people going through their doors, which means a lot more people coming through ours.” The pharmacy is at the centre of the village, both physically and metaphorically. Although he brushes off the notion of a pastoral role with modesty, its clear this is the case. “With the elderly living alone and feeling a lot more isolated, we are one of their few points of contact,” he says. “We know everybody who comes into the shop, we know their families and we can ask after them. Were part of the community. “We do try and reach out and have those chats, seethey are doing okay, orwere delivering to them we can have a chat on the doorstep and see how theyre keeping. “Its always felt that way though. Its a small village, there are a couple of pubs, a local shop with the post office, ourselves and the doctors. “The pubs have been closed and the doctors have been less available, so ourselves and the shop next door have probably been pivotal in keeping people going.” All over, this lockdown has been very dferent to its initial version last Spring. Covid has come creeping in to the Feeny community like many across Ireland. “We got lucky the first time round, there were no surges here, but in September and October you began to see local people testing positive. Reality dawned on people that this was serious,” he says. “The lockdown before Christmas frustrated a lot of people, but in hindsight it was a mistake to let things open up again in the run-up to Christmas. Its cost lives. “We would have had the odd doubter of Covid coming in during the summer months, but we dont seem to have them coming in any more.” Wise words greet customers at Sizzles in Feeny. Next door, in Sizzles chippy, they are cleaning in preparation for the evenings business. The door is open for ventilation when I askanyone is around to speak. Grainne plays the role of gatekeeper, listening to my reasons for disrupting their Thursday afternoon, before owner Marlene appears from the kitchen, satisfied with my explanation. “There is no fortune being made, but at least were surviving and looking forward to getting back to normal,” she tells me. “You always worry, because you think will this week be okay  Its stressful for anybody, but I feel sorry for people in the restaurant game. “I always want to work, but sometimesthe government says you cant, then you cant. Youre always concerned about your staff and customers.” Marlene echoes Declans analysis of how the virus has crept up on the people of the village. “At the start it didnt really sink in, until people started to get unwell. You just didnt want to see loved ones get taken to hospital and you were watching horror stories on the news of it being fatal,” she says. “The summer was great because you were home early in the evenings and there was nice weather. Its tough now on peoples mental health, trying to stay positive. “Since the schools closed, its hard for childcare as well. It affects the whole community, but keeping going is important.” There is a big push to improve broadband in the area at present. It is clear the business owners in the centre of Feeny feel a wider responsibility than simply providing a service. Marlene says its hard to lt peoples spirits in such emotionally sanitised circumstances. “Everybody expresses theyre fed up, and were all in the one boat, but you cant spend a lot of time because we can only allow one person in at a time,” she said. “It removes that bit of banter between people, but thats the times were in. You still have people who want to come in and stand and you feel bad askingyou can bring it out to them.” “If one of us went down though, thats the whole team down and it has a knock-on effect.” Birds are dancing back and forth across the Feeny Road as I make my way back towards the car. I note the name of the pub – Sperrin View. I take a moment to savour it, looking down Glenedra Road as the sun breaks over the Sperrins. Its a pity no one will be able to experience it for a while. On the way back out the road, I stop off at Banagher Glen, on the off chance any walkers want to share their lockdown experience. Im halfway down the narrow road when Im waved down by two perplexed looking men standing outside a van. “Do you knowThomas Murphys gravel pit is anywhere round here ” asks one of them. I shake my head. Its probably time I went home.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Extremely quiet. The other places Ive visited have been quiet, but not to this extent. Just like it takes your eyes a while to adjust to new light,you wait long enough, things come into focus. A Claudy Fuels lorry roars past and when it clears, there is movement. A young boy in Banagher gear emerges from the Spar shop clutching a plastic bag. He hasnt far to go, and with a quick look either way, darts across the road and disappears into a house on Feeny Road. At its heart, Feenys main thoroughfare is a residential street, and the people who live there are staying at home. googletag.cmd.push Walking up the hill towards the GAA pitch, the sun briefly illuminates figures at windows. An elderly man squints against the sun as he peers out his window. I catch glimpses of home-schooled children appearing at the windows as I make my way past. The distinctive air brake of the bin lorry comes at regular intervals. One woman rushes from her house with a bin in tow, spinning it on the kerb before retreating back into her home. Covid- messaging on the gates of Fr McNally Park. Smoke from internal fires wafts through the air as I reach Fr McNally Park, where the sun is breaking through the haze to create a spectacular backdrop. googletag.cmd.push The pitch is the first place of note you reach when you enter Feeny. It acts almost as a gatekeeper for the village, but its own gates are open. There dont appear to be any walkers on the grounds though, and I head back towards the centre of the village, where cars are parked around its hub the pharmacy, supermarket and chippy. A man stops me in the pharmacy car park, askingI know where he can find the boy that does the tarmac – McCloskey. Its as near to the needle in a haystack conundrum as you will find. I wish him luck.     Outside Feeny pharmacy, a makesht shelter has been erected to facilitate a socially distanced queue, but there is none today. Local pharmacist Declan Bateson believes people are taking things seriously. Owner Declan Bateson tells me this lockdown has been much quieter than its predecessors. “After Christmas, its been quieter. People are taking it seriously and have seen the surge in the hospitals,” says the  All-Ireland winner. “In the run-up to Christmas it was very busy. Retail shops were closed for a while and with the pharmacy being allowed to stay open, it meant we were busier. “GPs have tightened up who can come and theyve had a lot less people going through their doors, which means a lot more people coming through ours.” The pharmacy is at the centre of the village, both physically and metaphorically. Although he brushes off the notion of a pastoral role with modesty, its clear this is the case. “With the elderly living alone and feeling a lot more isolated, we are one of their few points of contact,” he says. “We know everybody who comes into the shop, we know their families and we can ask after them. Were part of the community. “We do try and reach out and have those chats, seethey are doing okay, orwere delivering to them we can have a chat on the doorstep and see how theyre keeping. “Its always felt that way though. Its a small village, there are a couple of pubs, a local shop with the post office, ourselves and the doctors. “The pubs have been closed and the doctors have been less available, so ourselves and the shop next door have probably been pivotal in keeping people going.” All over, this lockdown has been very dferent to its initial version last Spring. Covid has come creeping in to the Feeny community like many across Ireland. “We got lucky the first time round, there were no surges here, but in September and October you began to see local people testing positive. Reality dawned on people that this was serious,” he says. “The lockdown before Christmas frustrated a lot of people, but in hindsight it was a mistake to let things open up again in the run-up to Christmas. Its cost lives. “We would have had the odd doubter of Covid coming in during the summer months, but we dont seem to have them coming in any more.” Wise words greet customers at Sizzles in Feeny. Next door, in Sizzles chippy, they are cleaning in preparation for the evenings business. The door is open for ventilation when I askanyone is around to speak. Grainne plays the role of gatekeeper, listening to my reasons for disrupting their Thursday afternoon, before owner Marlene appears from the kitchen, satisfied with my explanation. “There is no fortune being made, but at least were surviving and looking forward to getting back to normal,” she tells me. “You always worry, because you think will this week be okay  Its stressful for anybody, but I feel sorry for people in the restaurant game. “I always want to work, but sometimesthe government says you cant, then you cant. Youre always concerned about your staff and customers.” Marlene echoes Declans analysis of how the virus has crept up on the people of the village. “At the start it didnt really sink in, until people started to get unwell. You just didnt want to see loved ones get taken to hospital and you were watching horror stories on the news of it being fatal,” she says. “The summer was great because you were home early in the evenings and there was nice weather. Its tough now on peoples mental health, trying to stay positive. “Since the schools closed, its hard for childcare as well. It affects the whole community, but keeping going is important.” There is a big push to improve broadband in the area at present. It is clear the business owners in the centre of Feeny feel a wider responsibility than simply providing a service. Marlene says its hard to lt peoples spirits in such emotionally sanitised circumstances. “Everybody expresses theyre fed up, and were all in the one boat, but you cant spend a lot of time because we can only allow one person in at a time,” she said. “It removes that bit of banter between people, but thats the times were in. You still have people who want to come in and stand and you feel bad askingyou can bring it out to them.” “If one of us went down though, thats the whole team down and it has a knock-on effect.” Birds are dancing back and forth across the Feeny Road as I make my way back towards the car. I note the name of the pub – Sperrin View. I take a moment to savour it, looking down Glenedra Road as the sun breaks over the Sperrins. Its a pity no one will be able to experience it for a while. On the way back out the road, I stop off at Banagher Glen, on the off chance any walkers want to share their lockdown experience. Im halfway down the narrow road when Im waved down by two perplexed looking men standing outside a van. “Do you knowThomas Murphys gravel pit is anywhere round here ” asks one of them. I shake my head. Its probably time I went home.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The had time left on their degree courses and their leadership and commitment aided a developing club into a growing entity. The club continued to grow in numbers and grow stronger both on and off the field year on year. Several players, including Stephen, went on to play for Scotland at the British Universities Tournament. And members of the club gained colours for their contribution to sporting le while at University. “Stephen was captain on the field and went on to show these same leadership skills, whilst in the chair,” Declan commented. “Gaby contributed immensely throughout the formative years as well in ious roles within the committee. “Having worked closely with both, I knew the club and the future were in safe dedicated hands,” Loane added. “All university clubs need and rely on a continuation of committed iniduals beyond one degree term, to keep the momentum of any club. With each new academic year, all clubs hope that a committed fresher will come on-board – both on and off the field. In my time, that fresher was Stephen.” It was only the beginning and it wasnt too long before there were Derry fingerprints on the clubs baton again. Oisin Moran and Aaron Conwaypictured at Freshers Day  in Stirling Magherafelt man Oisin Moran, son of former Derry physio Sean, arrived in Stirling to study Sports and Exercise Science. He was part of a very successful underage team at home, which culminated in winning the  All-Ireland U Féile. On new soil he didnt know anyone and had to build a new friendship network that remains strong to this day. Oisin takes up the story. When I joined the team, there was a mix of Irish and non-Irish players with a  of . As most of the players were in their final year, it created problems when I took over the club the following year. During my first year I learned a lot about the club traditions and values which Declan had cited. The Stirling team did not have a large  of  plus Irish players to choose from like some universities so we had to branch out and attract players from a non GAA background and from dferent parts of the world. A sense of family was soon established, much like clubs at home. We had the opportunity to go down and play in the British Championships in Birmingham, which helped give me an insight to the championship and made me determined to bring the club down every year and to compete against other Universities from Scotland and England. Towards the end of my first year we held our AGM and I put my name forward to be nominated for captain of the team the following year and I was successfully appointed. Odhran Hassan from Banagher was elected president of the club at the same time and we came together at the end of our first year to develop a plan to build and grow the club both on and off the field. I think this is a challenge for most University Clubs as teams have to be rebuilt regularly and it’s an even bigger challenge for teams like ourselves as we don’t get an influx of Irish students every year. At the start of second year, myself and Odhran began the process of rebuilding and quickly started the recruitment process. This included social media posts, putting posters up around the university, handing out flyers. We also had a stall booked for the sports bazaar which is held during Freshers week. Overall our recruitment drive was very successful and we got around  people to join the club. Myself and Odhran ran the club, we trained the team as well as honouring and managing our sponsorship agreements. We arranged referees for games andplaying away would secure transport to and from the venue. We needed good time management, as we were doing this alongside studying for a degree. However I wouldn’t have changed it for the world. Id happily do it again as I was doing the role because I love the sport and wanted to grow and develop the club. At the AGM I stood for the position of President and I was successfully appointed for the - season. As President, I continued to build on the good work myself and Odhran started and continued to expand the clubs numbers and also had the opportunity and resources to attend British Championships again that year. We also combined the women’s Gaelic team onto our sponsorship agreement which helped bring the two clubs closer together. Throughout the year we held joint social events which were great craic and also every week we held a joint training session on a Sundayno league games were being played that weekend just to get everyone together and have a bit of fun playing the sport we all love. Towards the second half of the year I made the decision that I should pass the responsibilities of running the club over to someone  as I was going into my final year and needed to focus on my studies and I knew I couldn’t commit the proper time that was needed to successfully run the team. At this point I could see Aaronwas very committed to the team and could see he shared the same love and enthusiasm for the sport. Maybe it was because we are both from Derry, but I knew the club would be in safe hands so I encouraged him to run for President at the end of year and I would be there in my final year to give him any advice he would need. Overall I’m very proud I had the opportunity to be a part of the club and learn its history and then be able to contribute to maintaining the traditions and club values whilst helping build the club over the years I was attending University in Stirling. If you asked me what was a more important achievement to me gaining a degree or running a Gaelic team it would be the Gaelic team and it wouldn’t even be close. *** Aaron Conways first experience of the Stirling University Gaelic football team was on a Wednesday afternoon, in September , at the sports bazaar. Having moved over from Derry, without knowing anyone beforehand, he figured it would be a good way to settle in and make friends. He takes up the story. I had just put my name down for trials for the soccer team when I overheard a thick Irish accent say ah lads Mayo have no chance against Dublin on Sunday, I looked over to see a guy in a Roscommon jersey sat at a table with a tricolour hung in the background. As I walked over, I saw a sign which read Men’s Gaelic Football and a laptop on the table which was showing the  All Ireland Football Final. As I approached the table, a guy in a Derry jersey introduced himself as Odhran and askedI was interested in joining the team. We chatted for a few minutes and I gave him my contact details and that was it. For me this was better than expected, as I was able to make friends with people from home and to have the chance to start playing Gaelic football again as I had stopped playing for Craigbane at U level. At the end of my first year, I was voted onto the committee as the social secretary and it was only here where I started to see the work that went on behind the scenes to keep the club running. One of the major challenges which most university sports teams face is the constant turnover of players and members. We had to try and find as many Irish players as we could and then supplement that by training up non-Irish guys who were interested in playing and try to get them up to speed before the first games of the season which were usually in the first weeks of October. This didn’t give us much time and wasn’t helped by the lack of floodlights on the grass pitches which meant that from October until February most of our training sessions were held on a G pitch with only soccer goals to use for shooting drills. Throughout my time at Stirling, we were lucky to have a good core of Irish players and managed to successfully train up a few from scratch into fairly decent players. Most of the players during my time were from the UK and Ireland but we also had players from Sweden, Spain and even Australia. The league was always dficult to compete in as we were coming up against teams from Glasgow, Edinburgh Aberdeen and Dundee most of whom were able to field teams with at least  or  Irish players. We might have only had six or seven, with the rest made up of players who may have only had a handful of training sessions before being flung in at the deep end so to speak. This meant some one-sided matches at times but the key thing here was to try and make sure the new lads didn’t get too disheartened. The British Championships would have been our main focus each year as we would be playing teams from all over Britain with similar ability to ourselves. In , which was my first time going to the British Championship, we reached the quarter finals where we were beaten by a strong Heriot-Watt team that reached the final that year. The following year in , when I was now President of the club, we were confident of doing well as we had a good squad and had trained hard however fortunes weren’t to be in our favour as due to waterlogged pitches. All  teams in our ision had to play their matches on one already drenched pitch in Leeds. By the time of the fourth game of the day the surface resembled a bog more than a football pitch, games were changed to  minutes straight to try and get the competition finished. Our last game of the competition finished - to -, giving you a taste of the conditions which also meant we would finish second in the group and miss out on the semi-finals. In  in my final year on the team and still president we were determined to go one step further, but a last-minute change of dates meant we wouldn’t be able to send a team that year as everyone had already changed their commitments for the original date which was disappointing personally. Outside of football the British Championship weekends in Manchester were always a great weekends craic and was good for team bonding. The St Patricks Day Festival Cup was a challenge match we played every year against Sands McSwineys Coatbridge who are a club team from just outside Glasgow. Despite the name the cup match has been played anywhere from December to April but was usually played a week or two after St Patricks Day. This was good for us in the committee as it gave us something to keep training for after British championships. The games against Coatbridge were always competitive and occasionally controversial. After two attempts – a defeat and a controversial late abandonment when we were seven or eight points clear - we eventually got our hands on the trophy which was a good experience for some of the lads who were new to the sport. We were able to defend our trophy the following year as well. The social aspect of the club was also very important, having a strong social element allowed the guys who maybe weren’t the best players or couldn’t make training sessions or matches due to other commitments were still very much included in the club. Throughout the year we would hold multiple socials and nights out alongside the ladies team. The All Ireland Final and the Sky GAA TV deal was a major boost for us at the time, because it meant that we would be able to hold the social in Molly Malones Bar in Stirling instead of having to travel to Glasgow or Edinburgh. It quickly became a tradition that every year ourselves and the ladies would watch the game and it was an important social event. It was usually on the weekend after the sports bazaar so it was good for anyone who was joining the team to come along and meet the current team. Through sponsorship agreements with Dusk nightclub in Stirling we were able to help subsidise our travel to matches, referees, equipment and our accommodation for British Championships. One year we managed to raise over £, between ourselves and the ladies team through the sponsorship agreement which was huge for both teams financially. In October , the club’s th Anniversary, we reached out to as many former players as we could contact and invited them to Stirling for a meal in aroom at the event centre of the University. The event was well attended and a number of the former players turned up to support us earlier in the day as we had a home game against Heriot-Watt. It was great to meet former players and hear stories of their time as part of the club. We had been planning to do something along the same lines last October for the th Anniversary, until Covid- scuppered our plans. From humble beginnings and  years later, the GAA roots in Stirling remain. Central to all of that was the Derry influence, as the baton was passed along the line.- Part one of the story of Stirlings Derry roots - Build it and they will come CLICK HERE...\",\"keywords\":\"GAA,Oisin Moran,Derry,StirlingGAA,Scotland,Aaron Conway\",\"articleSection\":\"Features\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"In part two of our look at the Derry influence on Stirling University, Michael McMullan looked into the experiences of Magherafelt man Oisin Moran and Craigbanes Aaron Conway as they kept the club on track.\",\"author\":,\"dateCreated\":\"--T::Z\",\"dateModied\":\"--T::Z\",\"datePublished\":\"--T::Z\" cmspos   *** Handle jQuery plugin naming conflict between jQuery UI and Bootstrap *** .widget.bridge@-webkit-viewport @-moz-viewport@-ms-viewport @-o-viewport@viewport - Twitter, Inc.

Every four years, the le-cycle of the average course, the committee members will move on. The early years in Stirling, with Magherafelt man Declan Loane founding the club in , were fruitful with the establishment of the clubs sevens tournament. But it needed to have a spine to carry it all the way to the current day. Lisburn man Peter ONeill and Ben McCloskey of Ballinascreen are at the forefront of the club, but passing the baton was the important piece of the puzzle. In Loanes final final year, a new committee was elected to take the club forward and keep the transition smooth, with members having experience in running all aspects of the club. googletag.cmd.push Down man Stephen Gallagher, the team captain, became Chairperson and Gabrielle Dunne , hailing from Strabane, took up the position of Club Secretary. The had time left on their degree courses and their leadership and commitment aided a developing club into a growing entity. The club continued to grow in numbers and grow stronger both on and off the field year on year. Several players, including Stephen, went on to play for Scotland at the British Universities Tournament. And members of the club gained colours for their contribution to sporting le while at University. “Stephen was captain on the field and went on to show these same leadership skills, whilst in the chair,” Declan commented. googletag.cmd.push “Gaby contributed immensely throughout the formative years as well in ious roles within the committee. “Having worked closely with both, I knew the club and the future were in safe dedicated hands,” Loane added. “All university clubs need and rely on a continuation of committed iniduals beyond one degree term, to keep the momentum of any club. With each new academic year, all clubs hope that a committed fresher will come on-board – both on and off the field. In my time, that fresher was Stephen.” It was only the beginning and it wasnt too long before there were Derry fingerprints on the clubs baton again.     Oisin Moran and Aaron Conwaypictured at Freshers Day  in Stirling Magherafelt man Oisin Moran, son of former Derry physio Sean, arrived in Stirling to study Sports and Exercise Science. He was part of a very successful underage team at home, which culminated in winning the  All-Ireland U Feacuteile. On new soil he didnt know anyone and had to build a new friendship network that remains strong to this day. Oisin takes up the story. When I joined the team, there was a mix of Irish and non-Irish players with a  of . As most of the players were in their final year, it created problems when I took over the club the following year. During my first year I learned a lot about the club traditions and values which Declan had cited. The Stirling team did not have a large  of  plus Irish players to choose from like some universities so we had to branch out and attract players from a non GAA background and from dferent parts of the world. A sense of family was soon established, much like clubs at home. We had the opportunity to go down and play in the British Championships in Birmingham, which helped give me an insight to the championship and made me determined to bring the club down every year and to compete against other Universities from Scotland and England. Towards the end of my first year we held our AGM and I put my name forward to be nominated for captain of the team the following year and I was successfully appointed. Odhran Hassan from Banagher was elected president of the club at the same time and we came together at the end of our first year to develop a plan to build and grow the club both on and off the field. I think this is a challenge for most University Clubs as teams have to be rebuilt regularly and it’s an even bigger challenge for teams like ourselves as we don’t get an influx of Irish students every year. At the start of second year, myself and Odhran began the process of rebuilding and quickly started the recruitment process. This included social media posts, putting posters up around the university, handing out flyers. We also had a stall booked for the sports bazaar which is held during Freshers week. Overall our recruitment drive was very successful and we got around  people to join the club. Myself and Odhran ran the club, we trained the team as well as honouring and managing our sponsorship agreements. We arranged referees for games andplaying away would secure transport to and from the venue. We needed good time management,as we were doing this alongside studying for a degree. However I wouldn’t have changed it for the world. Id happily do it again as I was doing the role because I love the sport and wanted to grow and develop the club. At the AGM I stood for the position of President and I was successfully appointed for the - season. As President, I continued to build on the good work myself and Odhran started and continued to expand the clubs numbers and also had the opportunity and resources to attend British Championships again that year. We also combined the women’s Gaelic team onto our sponsorship agreement which helped bring the two clubs closer together. Throughout the year we held joint social events which were great craic and also every week we held a joint training session on a Sundayno league games were being played that weekend just to get everyone together and have a bit of fun playing the sport we all love. Towards the second half of the year I made the decision that I should pass the responsibilities of running the club over to someone  as I was going into my final year and needed to focus on my studies and I knew I couldn’t commit the proper time that was needed to successfully run the team. At this point I could see Aaronwas very committed to the team and could see he shared the same love and enthusiasm for the sport. Maybe it was because we are both from Derry, but I knew the club would be in safe hands so I encouraged him to run for President at the end of year and I would be there in my final year to give him any advice he would need. Overall I’m very proud I had the opportunity to be a part of the club and learn its history and then be able to contribute to maintaining the traditions and club values whilst helping build the club over the years I was attending University in Stirling. If you asked me what was a more important achievement to me gaining a degree or running a Gaelic team it would be the Gaelic team and it wouldn’t even be close. *** Aaron Conways first experience of the Stirling University Gaelic football team was on a Wednesday afternoon, in September , at the sports bazaar. Having moved over from Derry, without knowing anyone beforehand, he figured it would be a good way to settle in and make friends. He takes up the story. I had just put my name down for trials for the soccer team when I overheard a thick Irish accent say ah lads Mayo have no chance against Dublin on Sunday, I looked over to see a guy in a Roscommon jersey sat at a table with a tricolour hung in the background. As I walked over, I saw a sign which read Men’s Gaelic Football and a laptop on the table which was showing the  All Ireland Football Final. As I approached the table, a guy in a Derry jersey introduced himself as Odhran and askedI was interested in joining the team. We chatted for a few minutes and I gave him my contact details and that was it. For me this was better than expected, as I was able to make friends with people from home and to have the chance to start playing Gaelic football again as I had stopped playing for Craigbane at U level. At the end of my first year, I was voted onto the committee as the social secretary and it was only here where I started to see the work that went on behind the scenes to keep the club running. One of the major challenges which most university sports teams face is the constant turnover of players and members. We had to try and find as many Irish players as we could and then supplement that by training up non-Irish guys who were interested in playing and try to get them up to speed before the first games of the season which were usually in the first weeks of October. This didn’t give us much time and wasn’t helped by the lack of floodlights on the grass pitches which meant that from October until February most of our training sessions were held on a G pitch with only soccer goals to use for shooting drills. Throughout my time at Stirling, we were lucky to have a good core of Irish players and managed to successfully train up a few from scratch into fairly decent players. Most of the players during my time were from the UK and Ireland but we also had players from Sweden, Spain and even Australia. The league was always dficult to compete in as we were coming up against teams from Glasgow, Edinburgh Aberdeen and Dundee most of whom were able to field teams with at least  or  Irish players. We might have only had six or seven, with the rest made up of players who may have only had a handful of training sessions before being flung in at the deep end so to speak. This meant some one-sided matches at times but the key thing here was to try and make sure the new lads didn’t get too disheartened. The British Championships would have been our main focus each year as we would be playing teams from all over Britain with similar ability to ourselves. In , which was my first time going to the British Championship, we reached the quarter finals where we were beaten by a strong Heriot-Watt team that reached the final that year. The following year in , when I was now President of the club, we were confident of doing well as we had a good squad and had trained hard however fortunes weren’t to be in our favour as due to waterlogged pitches. All  teams in our ision had to play their matches on one already drenched pitch in Leeds. By the time of the fourth game of the day the surface resembled a bog more than a football pitch, games were changed to  minutes straight to try and get the competition finished. Our last game of the competition finished - to -, giving you a taste of the conditions which also meant we would finish second in the group and miss out on the semi-finals. In  in my final year on the team and still president we were determined to go one step further, but a last-minute change of dates meant we wouldn’t be able to send a team that year as everyone had already changed their commitments for the original date which was disappointing personally. Outside of football the British Championship weekends in Manchester were always a great weekends craic and was good for team bonding. The St Patricks Day Festival Cup was a challenge match we played every year against Sands McSwineys Coatbridge who are a club team from just outside Glasgow. Despite the name the cup match has been played anywhere from December to April but was usually played a week or two after St Patricks Day. This was good for us in the committee as it gave us something to keep training for after British championships. The games against Coatbridge were always competitive and occasionally controversial. After two attempts – a defeat and a controversial late abandonment when we were seven or eight points clear - we eventually got our hands on the trophy which was a good experience for some of the lads who were new to the sport. We were able to defend our trophy the following year as well. The social aspect of the club was also very important, having a strong social element allowed the guys who maybe weren’t the best players or couldn’t make training sessions or matches due to other commitments were still very much included in the club. Throughout the year we would hold multiple socials and nights out alongside the ladies team. The All Ireland Final and the Sky GAA TV deal was a major boost for us at the time, because it meant that we would be able to hold the social in Molly Malones Bar in Stirling instead of having to travel to Glasgow or Edinburgh. It quickly became a tradition that every year ourselves and the ladies would watch the game and it was an important social event. It was usually on the weekend after the sports bazaar so it was good for anyone who was joining the team to come along and meet the current team. Through sponsorship agreements with Dusk nightclub in Stirling we were able to help subsidise our travel to matches, referees, equipment and our accommodation for British Championships. One year we managed to raise over pound, between ourselves and the ladies team through the sponsorship agreement which was huge for both teams financially. In October , the club’s th Anniversary, we reached out to as many former players as we could contact and invited them to Stirling for a meal in aroom at the event centre of the University. The event was well attended and a number of the former players turned up to support us earlier in the day as we had a home game against Heriot-Watt. It was great to meet former players and hear stories of their time as part of the club. We had been planning to do something along the same lines last October for the th Anniversary, until Covid- scuppered our plans. From humble beginnings and  years later, the GAA roots in Stirling remain. Central to all of that was the Derry influence, as the baton was passed along the line.  - Part one of the story of Stirlings Derry roots - Build it and they will come CLICK HERE...  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The had time left on their degree courses and their leadership and commitment aided a developing club into a growing entity. The club continued to grow in numbers and grow stronger both on and off the field year on year. Several players, including Stephen, went on to play for Scotland at the British Universities Tournament. And members of the club gained colours for their contribution to sporting le while at University. “Stephen was captain on the field and went on to show these same leadership skills, whilst in the chair,” Declan commented. “Gaby contributed immensely throughout the formative years as well in ious roles within the committee. “Having worked closely with both, I knew the club and the future were in safe dedicated hands,” Loane added. “All university clubs need and rely on a continuation of committed iniduals beyond one degree term, to keep the momentum of any club. With each new academic year, all clubs hope that a committed fresher will come on-board – both on and off the field. In my time, that fresher was Stephen.” It was only the beginning and it wasnt too long before there were Derry fingerprints on the clubs baton again. Oisin Moran and Aaron Conwaypictured at Freshers Day  in Stirling Magherafelt man Oisin Moran, son of former Derry physio Sean, arrived in Stirling to study Sports and Exercise Science. He was part of a very successful underage team at home, which culminated in winning the  All-Ireland U Féile. On new soil he didnt know anyone and had to build a new friendship network that remains strong to this day. Oisin takes up the story. When I joined the team, there was a mix of Irish and non-Irish players with a  of . As most of the players were in their final year, it created problems when I took over the club the following year. During my first year I learned a lot about the club traditions and values which Declan had cited. The Stirling team did not have a large  of  plus Irish players to choose from like some universities so we had to branch out and attract players from a non GAA background and from dferent parts of the world. A sense of family was soon established, much like clubs at home. We had the opportunity to go down and play in the British Championships in Birmingham, which helped give me an insight to the championship and made me determined to bring the club down every year and to compete against other Universities from Scotland and England. Towards the end of my first year we held our AGM and I put my name forward to be nominated for captain of the team the following year and I was successfully appointed. Odhran Hassan from Banagher was elected president of the club at the same time and we came together at the end of our first year to develop a plan to build and grow the club both on and off the field. I think this is a challenge for most University Clubs as teams have to be rebuilt regularly and it’s an even bigger challenge for teams like ourselves as we don’t get an influx of Irish students every year. At the start of second year, myself and Odhran began the process of rebuilding and quickly started the recruitment process. This included social media posts, putting posters up around the university, handing out flyers. We also had a stall booked for the sports bazaar which is held during Freshers week. Overall our recruitment drive was very successful and we got around  people to join the club.

We arranged referees for games andplaying away would secure transport to and from the venue. We needed good time management, as we were doing this alongside studying for a degree.

At the AGM I stood for the position of President and I was successfully appointed for the - season. As President, I continued to build on the good work myself and Odhran started and continued to expand the clubs numbers and also had the opportunity and resources to attend British Championships again that year. We also combined the women’s Gaelic team onto our sponsorship agreement which helped bring the two clubs closer together. Throughout the year we held joint social events which were great craic and also every week we held a joint training session on a Sundayno league games were being played that weekend just to get everyone together and have a bit of fun playing the sport we all love.

At this point I could see Aaronwas very committed to the team and could see he shared the same love and enthusiasm for the sport. Maybe it was because we are both from Derry, but I knew the club would be in safe hands so I encouraged him to run for President at the end of year and I would be there in my final year to give him any advice he would need. Overall I’m very proud I had the opportunity to be a part of the club and learn its history and then be able to contribute to maintaining the traditions and club values whilst helping build the club over the years I was attending University in Stirling. If you asked me what was a more important achievement to me gaining a degree or running a Gaelic team it would be the Gaelic team and it wouldn’t even be close. *** Aaron Conways first experience of the Stirling University Gaelic football team was on a Wednesday afternoon, in September , at the sports bazaar. Having moved over from Derry, without knowing anyone beforehand, he figured it would be a good way to settle in and make friends. He takes up the story. I had just put my name down for trials for the soccer team when I overheard a thick Irish accent say ah lads Mayo have no chance against Dublin on Sunday, I looked over to see a guy in a Roscommon jersey sat at a table with a tricolour hung in the background. As I walked over, I saw a sign which read Men’s Gaelic Football and a laptop on the table which was showing the  All Ireland Football Final. As I approached the table, a guy in a Derry jersey introduced himself as Odhran and askedI was interested in joining the team. We chatted for a few minutes and I gave him my contact details and that was it. For me this was better than expected, as I was able to make friends with people from home and to have the chance to start playing Gaelic football again as I had stopped playing for Craigbane at U level. At the end of my first year, I was voted onto the committee as the social secretary and it was only here where I started to see the work that went on behind the scenes to keep the club running. One of the major challenges which most university sports teams face is the constant turnover of players and members. We had to try and find as many Irish players as we could and then supplement that by training up non-Irish guys who were interested in playing and try to get them up to speed before the first games of the season which were usually in the first weeks of October. This didn’t give us much time and wasn’t helped by the lack of floodlights on the grass pitches which meant that from October until February most of our training sessions were held on a G pitch with only soccer goals to use for shooting drills. Throughout my time at Stirling, we were lucky to have a good core of Irish players and managed to successfully train up a few from scratch into fairly decent players. Most of the players during my time were from the UK and Ireland but we also had players from Sweden, Spain and even Australia. The league was always dficult to compete in as we were coming up against teams from Glasgow, Edinburgh Aberdeen and Dundee most of whom were able to field teams with at least  or  Irish players. We might have only had six or seven, with the rest made up of players who may have only had a handful of training sessions before being flung in at the deep end so to speak. This meant some one-sided matches at times but the key thing here was to try and make sure the new lads didn’t get too disheartened. The British Championships would have been our main focus each year as we would be playing teams from all over Britain with similar ability to ourselves. In , which was my first time going to the British Championship, we reached the quarter finals where we were beaten by a strong Heriot-Watt team that reached the final that year. The following year in , when I was now President of the club, we were confident of doing well as we had a good squad and had trained hard however fortunes weren’t to be in our favour as due to waterlogged pitches. All  teams in our ision had to play their matches on one already drenched pitch in Leeds. By the time of the fourth game of the day the surface resembled a bog more than a football pitch, games were changed to  minutes straight to try and get the competition finished. Our last game of the competition finished - to -, giving you a taste of the conditions which also meant we would finish second in the group and miss out on the semi-finals. In  in my final year on the team and still president we were determined to go one step further, but a last-minute change of dates meant we wouldn’t be able to send a team that year as everyone had already changed their commitments for the original date which was disappointing personally. Outside of football the British Championship weekends in Manchester were always a great weekends craic and was good for team bonding. The St Patricks Day Festival Cup was a challenge match we played every year against Sands McSwineys Coatbridge who are a club team from just outside Glasgow. Despite the name the cup match has been played anywhere from December to April but was usually played a week or two after St Patricks Day. This was good for us in the committee as it gave us something to keep training for after British championships. The games against Coatbridge were always competitive and occasionally controversial. After two attempts – a defeat and a controversial late abandonment when we were seven or eight points clear - we eventually got our hands on the trophy which was a good experience for some of the lads who were new to the sport. We were able to defend our trophy the following year as well. The social aspect of the club was also very important, having a strong social element allowed the guys who maybe weren’t the best players or couldn’t make training sessions or matches due to other commitments were still very much included in the club. Throughout the year we would hold multiple socials and nights out alongside the ladies team. The All Ireland Final and the Sky GAA TV deal was a major boost for us at the time, because it meant that we would be able to hold the social in Molly Malones Bar in Stirling instead of having to travel to Glasgow or Edinburgh. It quickly became a tradition that every year ourselves and the ladies would watch the game and it was an important social event. It was usually on the weekend after the sports bazaar so it was good for anyone who was joining the team to come along and meet the current team. Through sponsorship agreements with Dusk nightclub in Stirling we were able to help subsidise our travel to matches, referees, equipment and our accommodation for British Championships. One year we managed to raise over £, between ourselves and the ladies team through the sponsorship agreement which was huge for both teams financially. In October , the club’s th Anniversary, we reached out to as many former players as we could contact and invited them to Stirling for a meal in aroom at the event centre of the University. The event was well attended and a number of the former players turned up to support us earlier in the day as we had a home game against Heriot-Watt. It was great to meet former players and hear stories of their time as part of the club. We had been planning to do something along the same lines last October for the th Anniversary, until Covid- scuppered our plans. From humble beginnings and  years later, the GAA roots in Stirling remain. Central to all of that was the Derry influence, as the baton was passed along the line.- Part one of the story of Stirlings Derry roots - Build it and they will come CLICK HERE...\",\"keywords\":\"GAA,Oisin Moran,Derry,StirlingGAA,Scotland,Aaron Conway\",\"articleSection\":\"Features\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"In part two of our look at the Derry influence on Stirling University, Michael McMullan looked into the experiences of Magherafelt man Oisin Moran and Craigbanes Aaron Conway as they kept the club on track.\",\"author\":,\"dateCreated\":\"--T::Z\",\"dateModied\":\"--T::Z\",\"datePublished\":\"--T::Z\" cmspos   *** Handle jQuery plugin naming conflict between jQuery UI and Bootstrap *** .widget.bridge@-webkit-viewport @-moz-viewport@-ms-viewport @-o-viewport@viewport - Twitter, Inc.

Every four years, the le-cycle of the average course, the committee members will move on. The early years in Stirling, with Magherafelt man Declan Loane founding the club in , were fruitful with the establishment of the clubs sevens tournament. But it needed to have a spine to carry it all the way to the current day. Lisburn man Peter ONeill and Ben McCloskey of Ballinascreen are at the forefront of the club, but passing the baton was the important piece of the puzzle. In Loanes final final year, a new committee was elected to take the club forward and keep the transition smooth, with members having experience in running all aspects of the club. googletag.cmd.push Down man Stephen Gallagher, the team captain, became Chairperson and Gabrielle Dunne , hailing from Strabane, took up the position of Club Secretary. The had time left on their degree courses and their leadership and commitment aided a developing club into a growing entity. The club continued to grow in numbers and grow stronger both on and off the field year on year. Several players, including Stephen, went on to play for Scotland at the British Universities Tournament. And members of the club gained colours for their contribution to sporting le while at University. “Stephen was captain on the field and went on to show these same leadership skills, whilst in the chair,” Declan commented. googletag.cmd.push “Gaby contributed immensely throughout the formative years as well in ious roles within the committee. “Having worked closely with both, I knew the club and the future were in safe dedicated hands,” Loane added. “All university clubs need and rely on a continuation of committed iniduals beyond one degree term, to keep the momentum of any club. With each new academic year, all clubs hope that a committed fresher will come on-board – both on and off the field. In my time, that fresher was Stephen.” It was only the beginning and it wasnt too long before there were Derry fingerprints on the clubs baton again.     Oisin Moran and Aaron Conwaypictured at Freshers Day  in Stirling Magherafelt man Oisin Moran, son of former Derry physio Sean, arrived in Stirling to study Sports and Exercise Science. He was part of a very successful underage team at home, which culminated in winning the  All-Ireland U Feacuteile. On new soil he didnt know anyone and had to build a new friendship network that remains strong to this day. Oisin takes up the story. When I joined the team, there was a mix of Irish and non-Irish players with a  of . As most of the players were in their final year, it created problems when I took over the club the following year. During my first year I learned a lot about the club traditions and values which Declan had cited. The Stirling team did not have a large  of  plus Irish players to choose from like some universities so we had to branch out and attract players from a non GAA background and from dferent parts of the world. A sense of family was soon established, much like clubs at home. We had the opportunity to go down and play in the British Championships in Birmingham, which helped give me an insight to the championship and made me determined to bring the club down every year and to compete against other Universities from Scotland and England. Towards the end of my first year we held our AGM and I put my name forward to be nominated for captain of the team the following year and I was successfully appointed. Odhran Hassan from Banagher was elected president of the club at the same time and we came together at the end of our first year to develop a plan to build and grow the club both on and off the field. I think this is a challenge for most University Clubs as teams have to be rebuilt regularly and it’s an even bigger challenge for teams like ourselves as we don’t get an influx of Irish students every year. At the start of second year, myself and Odhran began the process of rebuilding and quickly started the recruitment process. This included social media posts, putting posters up around the university, handing out flyers. We also had a stall booked for the sports bazaar which is held during Freshers week. Overall our recruitment drive was very successful and we got around  people to join the club. Myself and Odhran ran the club, we trained the team as well as honouring and managing our sponsorship agreements. We arranged referees for games andplaying away would secure transport to and from the venue. We needed good time management,as we were doing this alongside studying for a degree. However I wouldn’t have changed it for the world. Id happily do it again as I was doing the role because I love the sport and wanted to grow and develop the club. At the AGM I stood for the position of President and I was successfully appointed for the - season. As President, I continued to build on the good work myself and Odhran started and continued to expand the clubs numbers and also had the opportunity and resources to attend British Championships again that year. We also combined the women’s Gaelic team onto our sponsorship agreement which helped bring the two clubs closer together. Throughout the year we held joint social events which were great craic and also every week we held a joint training session on a Sundayno league games were being played that weekend just to get everyone together and have a bit of fun playing the sport we all love. Towards the second half of the year I made the decision that I should pass the responsibilities of running the club over to someone  as I was going into my final year and needed to focus on my studies and I knew I couldn’t commit the proper time that was needed to successfully run the team. At this point I could see Aaronwas very committed to the team and could see he shared the same love and enthusiasm for the sport. Maybe it was because we are both from Derry, but I knew the club would be in safe hands so I encouraged him to run for President at the end of year and I would be there in my final year to give him any advice he would need. Overall I’m very proud I had the opportunity to be a part of the club and learn its history and then be able to contribute to maintaining the traditions and club values whilst helping build the club over the years I was attending University in Stirling. If you asked me what was a more important achievement to me gaining a degree or running a Gaelic team it would be the Gaelic team and it wouldn’t even be close. *** Aaron Conways first experience of the Stirling University Gaelic football team was on a Wednesday afternoon, in September , at the sports bazaar. Having moved over from Derry, without knowing anyone beforehand, he figured it would be a good way to settle in and make friends. He takes up the story. I had just put my name down for trials for the soccer team when I overheard a thick Irish accent say ah lads Mayo have no chance against Dublin on Sunday, I looked over to see a guy in a Roscommon jersey sat at a table with a tricolour hung in the background. As I walked over, I saw a sign which read Men’s Gaelic Football and a laptop on the table which was showing the  All Ireland Football Final. As I approached the table, a guy in a Derry jersey introduced himself as Odhran and askedI was interested in joining the team. We chatted for a few minutes and I gave him my contact details and that was it. For me this was better than expected, as I was able to make friends with people from home and to have the chance to start playing Gaelic football again as I had stopped playing for Craigbane at U level. At the end of my first year, I was voted onto the committee as the social secretary and it was only here where I started to see the work that went on behind the scenes to keep the club running. One of the major challenges which most university sports teams face is the constant turnover of players and members. We had to try and find as many Irish players as we could and then supplement that by training up non-Irish guys who were interested in playing and try to get them up to speed before the first games of the season which were usually in the first weeks of October.

The boat, named Day Dawn N , ran ashore on August  last year and has remained anchored to the spot ever since. The retired fishing vessel had been acquired by Nathan Ross and Druso Martinez de Riquelme with a view to mooring it at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast as an Air B ‘n’ B. However, after running into dficulty last August, those plans have been put on hold. It was initially suspected that the tide was too low to refloat the boat. googletag.cmd.push However, the owners later revealed that the bigger issue was the fact that it’s suspended over a three and a half metre crater in the mudflats. In late November, the stars seemed to align to the sailors’ delight a high tide arrived and they secured the services of marine specialists to dig a channel under the boat in order to move it to a nearby marina. The drones were out to capture the moment Day Dawn made it back to sea. Unfortunately, their efforts proved unfruitful and, according to the owners, the operation cost a substantial sum of money. There has been little to no activity around the boat since the start of this year. googletag.cmd.push The Derry News asked Foyle Portthere will come a time when it may have to intervene orit’s possible the boat could become a permanent fixture on the River Foyle landscape. In response, a spokesperson said: “The responsibility for the movement of the boat remains firmly with the owners and we would encourage them to continue to do all they can to have the vessel re-floated. “This is an unfortunate situation that they have created and now must make every effort to employ further resources to deal with this problem. “We continue to monitor the location to ensure that the vessel poses no threat to the main navigation channel, nor that it is causing any unnecessary impact to the local environment.”     The boat owners were contacted for comment but none was provided at the time of publishing.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The mural at Great James Street was created by local company UV Arts. Ahead of the broadcast of the new ITV programme Home Sweet Home, which will feature Derry in an episode airing on Tuesday, February , it has been revealed that the mural was suggested by Joanna Lumley, the show’s presenter. Ms Lumley visited Derry in  to take part in a conference marking the th anniversary of Children in Crossfire, the charity set up by Mr Moore. She ed last autumn to film for the series in which she visits places special to her. googletag.cmd.push Ms Lumley said: “In Derry we wanted to film the historic murals, The Derry Girls and my friend Richard Moore, the ‘Derry Lama’, as the Dalai Lama calls him. “It suddenly seemed that we could link these three stories together by art: the ravishing mural Saoirse-Monica showed me of the Derry Girls led us easily to Karl, whose team is creating such important new art work in this fabulous city. “Would it be possible to celebrate the le-affirming achievements of the man the Dalai Lama calls ‘My hero’ in a mural  “The finished work is utterly magnicent, and I am proud that I was allowed to spray a tiny bit of it under Karl’s watchful eye. Part of me will always remain in Derry, a city I love with all my heart.” googletag.cmd.push  Mr Moore said: “When Joanna told me towards the end of our recording that we had one more stop to make, I could not have ever imagined what I was about to be shown. “I am so honoured and humbled at this wonderfully generous gesture. Joanna has been a good friend to me and a great supporter of Children in Crossfire, both of which mean a great deal to me. “She has also built a great rapport with Derry and many of its people, and I look forward to tuning in to Home Sweet Home to see our city at its best.     “I am also grateful to Karl Porter from UV Arts for his vision and genuine passion for this project”. Karl Porter from UV Arts, the creative arts team behind a whole host of public artworks in the city and the artist who painted the mural, said: “Its not everyday you get to paint a mural with Joanna Lumley, who is apparently very afraid of heights and I was told she will not get on the lt, but she did! “ “Joanna helped me direct the cherry picker and also painted one of the most important parts of the mural - the connection, the area where The Dalai Lama and Richard Moore touched. “I think the symbolism of this helps strengthen the relationship and the meaning behind the mural. “The mural depicts a Buddhist blessing, a signicant moment between His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Richard Moore. “The Unalome symbol rising from that connection is the Buddhist symbol representing the path to enlightenment. “Our journey in le is never perfect, never straight or even in the right direction but a journey nonetheless, full of lessons and experiences. Something that Richard has lived experience of, having overcome such a powerful injury to lead a wholesome and selfless le dedicated to others.” Karl said that when first approached about the project he was delighted to have the chance to celebrate one of Derrys greatest living heroes. “The chance to create our own connections led us to collaborate with Belfast based artist and illustrator Conor McClure and together create this powerful piece of art. “If you look closely, the shape of the heads and the Dalai Lamas embrace - forms the shape of a heart, a simple yet subtle way to celebrate the connections between these two iniduals. “It was a great privilege for me to be asked to produce this new mural. The image we have used is iconic, showing the Dalai Lama’s deep spirituality as well as his admiration for Richard Moore. I hope it will attract locals and visitors alike for many years to come and a poignant new addition to our street art movement in the city.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The plans involved the construction of  houses at a riverside site at Rossbay off the Limavady Road. Residents in the area had raised a large number of concerns in relation to the plans, including road safety and congestion issues. The plans were first submitted to Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning department in . They involved the proposed construction of  houses and eight bungalows on the land overlooking the River Foyle. After detailed examinations, the councils planning department recommended that the plans be approved. googletag.cmd.push However, the final say on planning applications rests with councillors on the councils Planning Committee. The committee held its monthly meeting today and there was a y discussion on the plans for the Rossbay site. Representatives for local residents opposed to the development and the company behind the housing plans were given the opportunity to address the meeting. The meeting was told that although  objections had been received in relation to the plans, they involved multiple submissions from  properties in the surrounding area. This was the largest number of objections that the council has ever received in relation to a planning application. googletag.cmd.push After the ious arguments were put forward at todays meeting, DUP councillor Hilary McClintock proposed that the committee go against the recommendation of the councils planning department and refuse permission for the Waterside development. Her proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and supported unanimously by all the councillors who were eligible to vote at the meeting. If so wished, the developer can now appeal the councils decision through the Planning Appeals Commission.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Signicant progress was made today in our challenge against the continued prohibition on children’s outdoor sport, said Mr Atherton.

At Mondays requiem mass, streamed live from St Patricks Glen, Parish Priest Father Paddy Doherty spoke of the many many people who wouldve been present, only for the current Covid- restrictions.

He was very popular in the community and among the other business owners in the town. On the field, in the shop and throughout the community, Freddie Joe was popular.

The -year-old has been chosen to replace Conor McCormack who recently departed the Brandywell for First Division side Galway United, with Toal the popular choice amongst his peers and the club’s fans. “I’m absolutely delighted to be captain of this club,” he said. “It’s a big club and it’s a proud, proud moment for me and my family. I didn’t really know it was coming until a week or two ago. It had been mentioned briefly but I didn’t pay any attention to it. It was something I always wanted to do. I always wanted to be captain and I’m happy that I’ve been chosen, but it’s a responsibility and hopefully I can adjust to it well and I can lead people.” googletag.cmd.push In his time at the club, Toal has worked with captains Gerard Doherty, Barry McNamee and McCormack, and he is determined to take a lesson from each experience as he dons the captain’s armband for the first time.  “They are all great captains and good people as well and I can only learn from people like that and take wee bits from them to help improve myself,” he explained. “I’m not going to change the person I am. I’m always going to be the same person, but there’s definitely more weight on my shoulders, maybe more for the younger boys coming through who might look up to me, so I have to make sure I’m doing everything right and that I’m as professional as I can.

Mr Fitzsimons is well-known for his walking tours in this area.ldquoI came up with the idea of doing the coastal path and following the pilgrim path to the holy well, he said.ldquoThe reason we did that was because of the outstanding natural beauty that is there. It is a really undiscovered kind of gem in the whole of the island in terms of the natural beauty.As part of the filming, Duane met the former president and Ciara for a picnic and a chat. ldquoWe staged the picnic at Ballyhornan with an upturned boat and our lunch on top of it, he explained.He added that it was a delight to meet the former president.ldquoMary McAleese was really quite personable and willing to get to know a bit about me and also about the whole area.The programmes takes guests to dferent locations in Ireland to talk about their spiritual journey through le.It is the second film in the current series to showcase the beauty of the Co Down countryside.The first film aired last month and featured the former president with Dundrum-born comedian Patrick Kielty on a walk through St Patrickrsquos Way in the Mournes.Mr Kielty was asked about his faith in God and replied: ldquoIf you are not going to believe in God walking up the Mourne Mountains, when are you going to believe in Him Former Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has also taken part in the series this year. Dr Tim Campbell, director of the St Patrick Centre, said he was delighted the focus was on Saint Patrickrsquos Way.He is looking forward to the new season of Camino-style walks being offered from April post lockdown.ldquoWe are really excited about the new coastal route we are offering which will be led in turns by guides Martina Purdy and Elaine Kelly, he said.ldquoThe walk some of the most beautul coast line on the island and features views of the Isle of Man on a clear day.ldquoThe well itself is amazing and the walk also takes in the historic church ruin at Ardtole. Details of all our walks can be found on www.saintpatrickcentre.Mr Fitzsimons will lead a guided six-mile walk which includes a visit to a pre-Christian burial site, a journey to the place where St Patrick landed in AD and a trip to St Tassachrsquos Church, Raholp. It leaves Saint Patrickrsquos Centre on April .All Walks of Le is on RTE One this Friday at .pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3Feb2021-Dissidents.jpg","title":"Dissidents linked to mortar rocket  ","story":"DISSIDENT republicans are being linked with the discovery of a viable rocket grenade near Seaforde last weekend.The discovery of the suspicious device was made by a member of the public last Saturday which resulted in a major security operation swinging into action and the closure of the main Newcastle Road. A number of residents were also forced to leave their homes.The mortar was discovered at the side of a busy road close to the entrance to Tievenadarragh Wood and after it was inspected by Army Technical Officers and declared safe, the device was taken away for detailed forensic examination.A number of politicians have expressed concern that this is the third device of its kind linked to dissident republicans which has been discovered in the area over the past two years.Previous devices linked to the terror group have been discovered just a few miles from Seaforde at the Priestrsquos Road and Drumcaw Road near Clough.PSNI District Commander, Superintendent Norman Haslett, has confirmed that the device discovered at the Newcastle Road was a suspected component part of a mortar, but did not contain any explosives.He said that while it was too early to attribute ownership to any particular grouping, he believed that dissident republican terrorists were responsible.Mr Haslett said the matter remained under investigation and appealed for anyone who can assist police with their enquiries to get in contact with them.Politicians have roundly condemned those responsible for leaving the device at the side of one of the districtrsquos most busiest roads.South Down SDLP MLA Colin McGrath, Sinn Fein MLA Emma Rogan and Slieve Croob Ulster Unionist councillor Alan Lewis, said there was no justication for the actions of those responsible.Mr McGrath described the discovery of the mortar component as ldquovery concerning and said the repercussions of the weekend incident could have been devastating.He declared: Such devices are a thing of our past and have no place in our modern country. The inconvenience and impact of this incident on the local community will be considerable and I condemn those that placed that device.ldquoThe fact that the Newcastle Road had to be closed for a number of hours last Saturday evening is both infuriating and depressing.

At this stage, no one knows.ldquoIt would be amazing to have the hall open again and performing in front of audiences and we would like to think we would be performing shows by Christmas,not sooner.Society members, friends or families, including the Gleesrsquo junior company, who wish to take part are asked to contact Suzanne on  .She added: ldquoWe are asking that as many people please take part at their own pace and have friends and family sponsor them or donate what they can.ldquoWe have created a JustGiving page to share on social media s and would ask people to share their photos or maps of their routes each day to raise awareness, posting on their own social media pages and the Glee Singers Facebook page.Anyone wishing to support the Newcastle Glees with their February fundraiser are asked to visit their JustGiving page at https:www.justgiving crowdfunding newcastleglees.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3Feb2021-Providing.jpg","title":"Providing special needs teaching during lockdown  ","story":"A SPECIAL needs teacher has used the lockdown to create a unique woodland play and outdoor classroom for children who benefit from a range of sensory experiences.Judith Riddell is behind the Empowering Little Minds consultancy in Drumaness and is currently working on a one to one basis outdoors with children with special needs, particularly boys and girls with autism.With the help and support of her husband David, Judith has worked since last March to create a unique and stimulating outdoor woodland classroom that was specically designed to provide a tailored approach to each child.Children aged from three up to  can explore a range of sensory activities on Judithrsquos private woodland and find out what helps them calm down and get to a place where they are able to learn and interact better.The desire to work one to one with children in an outdoor setting has become more important as the former teacher at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick adapted her business to suit lockdown restrictions.ldquoI had to mody my whole business since the first lockdown after I had self-funded creating my indoor classroom, explained Judith. ldquoI look on it as a positive spin-off from the lockdown as I was closed for nine months. It was something in the back of my mind to do but lockdown made me do it a lot earlier.She started up her consultancy business just over a year ago and has had to ldquothink outside the box since last March when social distancing became a new norm in the pandemic.ldquoWhen I first started the business, I wanted to empower children and their parents who would get an extra boost of some specialised training from me, she said. ldquoSometimes itrsquos hard for children to get all of their educational needs fully met in school.ldquoWhen I work one to one with them, itrsquos amazing to see their progress, even in such a short space of time. You see them really start to fly once their sensory system calms down and they are ready to take in information.Challenged by how she could still run her business during lockdown, Judith decided to put the eight acres of woodland she and her husband owns around their Crawfordstown Road home to good use.ldquoWe took over one acre and created the woodland classroom which can be accessed by a lot of willow structures that I created myself. Therersquos a massive tree house, things to swing on and climb on for the children to enjoy before they go into the woodland classroom which has everything an indoor classroom would have, she said.ldquoItrsquos actually great for both parents and children as they can listen to the birds and enjoy the woodland while their children are involved in learning activities.Judith has  years of experience of education special needs children after graduating from Cambridge University.ldquoI was always passionate about working with children with special needs and when I came back home I was fortunate enough to start working in Knockevin rather than starting in primary schools which I fully expected to do, said Judith.ldquoAfter a while I went to work in Bahrain to set up a school for special needs children on a three-year contract. I came back home just as things began to kick off in the Arab Spring and ed to work at Knockevin.ldquoI decided to set up my own practice in  as it was time to give some empowerment to parents as well as children. It gave me a chance to work with all aspects of a childrsquos development rather than working with one class for the whole year.Judith specialises in working with children aged -. She is also a training consultant for parents to help them understand their childrenrsquos sensory needs and working with staff from health organisations.Judith explained that while working with children with special needs is more complex and involves eight senses mdash not the five senses that we are all more familiar with mdash it can be very rewarding.ldquoAny child whorsquos born does not come with a training book, said Judith. ldquoSpecial needs children have very specic needs and you need to be able to read them in order to cater for that need.ldquoWith the coaching style I use, itrsquos about empowering parents to understand which sensory need their child needs to be fulfilled. With special needs children, you have to fill up with their sensory cup with all eight senses before they can start to learn, When the three extra senses are stimulated, they can be super-calming for everyone but particularly for children who canrsquot communicate their needs.ldquoWhen I coach parents, I explain about the three other senses, and tell what Irsquom doing and why Irsquom doing it to calm their child so that they then can keep using the same strategies at home. As the child learns to self-regulate more, the strategies change and the child is helped along the way.Despite having the space to accommodate more children after lockdown and when group activities are allowed again, Judith is focussed in developing her consultancy with the child always in mind.ldquoThe whole essence of the business is that it does not become a massive enterprise, she stressed.ldquoItrsquos about providing a more quiet, intimate area for the children so that they can feel safe and secure and itrsquos not overly busy. While I can expand and offer more sessions as the days gets longer, the woodland classroom will never be too busy.For further information visit www.empoweringlittleminds..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3Feb2021-NewcastleSPORT.jpg","title":"Royal County Down comes out top  ","story":"ROYAL County Down has been recognised as the most picturesque golf course in the world.The famed Newcastle links came out on top of a study by the Surprise Shop website, which looked at  of the most stunning courses from around the world.The  found that Royal County Down was the subject of , Instagram posts.

It is nothing short of a miracle that there hasnrsquot been a serious incident here.She said it was clear there had been an increase in traffic using the Loughinisland Road, in particular, heavy vehicles.ldquoMany young families reside in the centre of the village where children play regularly in the estates and green spaces. However, the street lighting also leaves a lot to be desired along this particular stretch stretch, confirmed Cllr Mason.ldquoI have called on roads officials to upgrade the existing lighting to the new LED system as well as assessing the area for new lighting requirements.Cllr Mason expressed concern that the Department of Infrastructure has handed back unspent money to the Treasury, branding the move as ldquosimply unacceptable when a relatively small amount would make huge improvements in Loughinisland and perhaps even delivering a much-needed footpath to safely connect the village to the only local shop and bus stops.She added: ldquoI have written to the government departmentrsquos isional roads manager, while my Sinn Feacutein colleague Emma Rogan MLA has written to Ms Mallon, outlining our concerns about the lack of investment in Loughinisland and the need for money to address key issues..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12293263.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Previously, Enda Kenny’s administration had been working with the UK to develop a light-touch surveillance system on the real boundary. Leo Varadkar and Mr Coveney jettisoned this work, adopting instead a high-risk tactic which they hoped would wreck Brexit. The responsibility is theirs.During the negotiations, the UK did not ask for any border controls but the EU insisted on scrupulous controls, ostensibly to protect the sanctity of its single market. The EU can be flexible when it wants, but chose to dig in on this issue.The UK should have left it to the EU to decide how to patrol its own frontier. If Dublin genuinely believed that a few CCTV cameras would provoke an upsurge in republican terrorism, it should have committed itself to working with the UK to maintain law and order.Alternatively, the EU could have decided to apply controls between the British Isles and mainland Europe. The British Isles have a long-established Common Travel Area . London and Dublin affirmed in May  that this would continue after Brexit Mr Coveney signed up for Ireland. This enables Irish people to enter and remain in the UKwithout restriction, unlike other EU citizens.Why could similarly exceptional arrangements not have been applied to goods  Would this not have reinforced the Belfast agreement by promoting cooperation north south and east west  It would certainly have avoided customs duties and regulatory barriers between Britain and Ireland removed other obstacles to east-west trade reflected the reality that the UK is Ireland’s principal trading partner in Europe and avoided the need to inspect goods twice which are travelling between Ireland and Europe via Great Britain.Looking ahead, Michael Gove co-chairs a joint committee with the EU, whose role is to resolve problems over the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement. Mr Gove now acknowledges that there is a problem requiring serious and urgent attention. At the least, the wording of the protocol must be claried and the EU must work with the UK government in good faith to repair the damage.Credit is due to Jim Allister who beat the DUP to the chase last week. Their statement as printed in Wednesday’s News Letter is welcome. The electorate will judge them by their actions over the coming months.Bill Smith, Belfast BT——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Now, these industries have been replaced by others. Perhaps neither as impressive nor as lucrative as the iron-wroughts of the past but still they are a source of daily bread. However, for people such as myself this source is now at risk. Whomever was tasked with representing Northern Ireland’s interests at the Brexit trade talks saw fit to acquiesce in Northern Ireland’s removal from the single market for services. In layman’s terms this means that contractors, freelancers, specialists and consultants who have their practices based in Northern Irelandare potentially barred from trading in the EU . If this comes to pass then I will have to take my practice out of Northern Ireland and base it in a country that can allow me to work with the EU . Though not immediately apparentit will certainly be felt by those whom manage my affairs in Northern Ireland and of course Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs will no longer be entitled to its percentage of my company’s earnings. This act could be replicated a thousandfold as northern based consultants have to move their admin where. I would ask that those who claim to stand for NI’s best interests go back to the drawing board and see to it that NI can be re-inserted into the single market for services. Rather than being a place that consultants will have to relocate from NI could instead become a place that consultants relocate to, as such a development would not escape the attention of consultants and service providers in GB who find themselves similarly cut off from EU work. Surely it is in our interests to have thousands of companies set up shop in Northern Ireland, pay tax here and utilise local services  There needs to be more examination of the actual consequences of our Brexit arrangements and proposals rather than acting out of blind zeal, which, I fear, has been the guiding hand of too many of those involved. If people find themselves more easily moved by rhetoric and fervour rather than daily bread issues then perhaps they could honourably choose to stand aside in favour of those whose vision is less clouded  Neale Weir, Castledawson, Co Londonderry——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

However, for the sake of my party, my health and my own conscience, I simply cannot continue in post.ldquoTherefore, I am stepping down as Leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Welsh Parliament with immediate effect.ldquoIt is for the group to decide how best to choose a new leader, but I hope that process will be seamless and speedy, and I pledge my support to whoever becomes leader.Mr Millar - MS for Clwyd West - also issued a statement, referring to \"a dficult week\".ldquoI want to apologise to my family, colleagues and constituents for any embarrassment that some of the media stories may have caused in recent days,\" he said.ldquoThere have been some wildly inaccurate and unfair reports so I want to set out the truth.\"As has been the case in most weeks since September when the Hybrid Senedd was sitting in Cardf Bay, on both the th and th December last year I used the self-serve catering arrangements that were made available for Senedd Members. On both evenings I served myself a pre-ordered, pre-prepared meal that was reheated in the microwave and ate it while drinking an alcoholic beverage and discussing work matters with colleagues.ldquoSocial distancing was maintained throughout these working dinners and it simply did not occur to either me, my colleagues or the catering team that the arrangements may have been inappropriate.ldquoThere was a member of catering staff present in the tea room for a short time after my arrival on the th December but she did not serve me a drink, nor did I request one. In fact, I encouraged the member of staff to go home and close up the counter as it had been a long day for her. No members of catering staff were present on the th December and the counter was closed for the whole evening.ldquoWhile I am advised that I did not breach coronavirus regulations I am very sorry for my actions, especially given the impact of the tough restrictions that people and businesses are enduring.ldquoFor this reason, and given that Paul Davies has resigned as Welsh Conservative Group Leader in the Senedd, I have decided to step down from my front bench role in the Welsh Parliament.ldquoI am cooperating fully with ongoing investigations and will continue to do so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

We have to do the right thing, which may mean that our measures have to be extended for some time to come, but no one should expect a signicant change in the arrangements or a signicant easing of those arrangements at the end of this week.The health minister was also asked about reports the lockdown restrictions may be eased in England, and whether a four-nation approach to easing the lockdown would be preferred.ldquoIts helpful for us to discuss these matters sensibly with each other, he said. ldquoThere is now much more regular engagement between the four governments, thatrsquos with the first ministers are meeting together with Michael Gove for the UK Government.ldquoWe havent had that direct engagement between the first ministers of not just Wales but also Scotland, Northern Ireland and Boris Johnson as prime minister, I think that would help us to do so.ldquoI hope that as it becomes a more real possibility will be able to have a grown up and constructive conversation between all four governments in the UK. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

Business support was a key topic, and it was devastating to hear Tina McKenzie, Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, discuss the hardships being faced and demonstrating the very bleak outlook for many businesseswe do not find a way forward both in terms of the handling of the pandemic,but also enhancing the support available to these businesses. The impact on business is substantial and that on each of their employees is devastating. Furlough has been a hottopic during this lockdown and as we have seen business vilied for not looking atrestructures, she reminded us of the fact that whilst the support available is welcomed, itremains far from enough to enable survival. I recently received an email from a local politician who stated, “I’m in awe you are still in business”. While this could be accepted as a compliment, this is far from the support andvoice a small business like mine requires or is looking for, and this was conveyed to them. The business community needs a clear voice with a key message and desire, rather than noise. These voices, like Tina, work tirelessly to press the government to step in with moresupport, minimising their costs and contribution while revenues are non-existent, and Iapplaud them for doing so. With news breaking this week that there is still pound million remaining in the Stormont COVID “pot” to be allocated towards businesses before March, I would urge Diane Doddsand Conor Murphy to listen to businesses and their representatives to ensure businessessurvive. It would be truly shamefulthis money had to be ed to Westminster as a result of poor planning and slow reactions, while local businesses are making very dficultdecisions due to lack of financial support which clearly is available, but not utilised. With financial survival for businesses and more importantly each of us as iniduals and our families the sole aim, Tina succinctly reminded us that our elected representatives should beheld to account, not the businesses themselves. The Sunday Times recently reported that the public feels more frightened now than at any time before with % of voters feeling ‘personally threatened’ by COVID. It also reportedthat Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have agreed on a ‘recovery plan’ to save jobs. The realityis however, thatthey and our own Executive do not deliver this strategy correctly, without delay or U-turn, the job market will constrict further. Many professional trade bodies arereporting that their members don’t have enough in the bank until April and judging bynumerous reports this past week, lockdown and on-going restrictions are likely to extend beyond April. How can businesses be expected to survive without this  We all have a voice, but not all of us use it. As a business community we need vocal and active business leaders to speak out to help fight our case. A great demonstrative exampleof this is the great work of my good friend Brian Donaldson from Excluded NI. Throughout,Brian has spoken out and acted to help thousands who have been financially excluded with no support being provided to them. Brian had established himself as newly self-employedchef just before lockdown, only to find that as support packages were announced, he quickly found himself excluded from all government support offered. With a family, and amortgage to pay, Brian created a  for his case to constructively find a resolution forall those who found themselves in the same situation. By working closely with local politicians, Brian, has researched and submitted proposals to the Department for the Economy with numerous resolutions and proposals to deliver financialassistance to these groups, which has resulted in thousands, including Ltd Company directors,eventually being awarded some financial support. Brian continues daily to ensure the excluded have a voice and shows how being a voice can bring about change! As a business owner, I send a huge thank you to all the hard-working professional trade bodies and voices for our communities, who throughout this time have worked tirelessly toensure we all have all have a business toto in the future. If you, like so many, are in adficult situation, be sure to reach out to your local business trade body today to highlight your plight and use their voices as much as you can. We all need as much support andsurvival mechanism as possible. It’s evident that the more voices there are and the louderthey become successful outcomes can be delivered. I will wrap up by leaving you with a well-known quote by Napoleon Bonaparte: ‘Ten people who speak make more noise than ten thousand who are silent’. Until next week, stay safe!

In line with the Department of Health’s twin track approach to accelerate vaccinations, both the online system and telephone booking line can be used by those in the - age group to make an appointment at one of the seven regional vaccination centres. While demand for vaccination slots is high, people are reminded that there will be enough appointments for everyone in the group so please remain patient. In the last five days the online booking system has been used to make , appointments. People are asked to reserve capacity on the telephone booking linefor those who cannot avail of the online booking facility. Where possible we would encourage booking appointments online. It is also anticipated that demand for telephone bookings will initially be very high. Therefore,you cannot get through initially, please be patient and try again later. Call volumes tend to be lower later in the day. If you can’t get through immediately then try again. The service is available from Monday to Friday .am to .pm. To fall within the - age bracket you must have been born between  April  and  March . Age and identity checks will be conducted at the vaccination centres. People outside the relevant age group should not misuse the online or telephone booking facility. Misuse will only make it more dficult for those to get through who are being prioritised because of their clinical vulnerability.
