Photograph: Christopher FurlongGetty Images The Government is discussing contingency plans with industry to organise energy rationing if the Ukraine war leads to an interruption in supplies of Russian oil and gas into European markets. The talks, acknowledged by three people briefed on the situation, have centred on concerns about the stability of winter supplies this year if there is no end to the Russian invasion and western sanctions against the Kremlin escalate. “It’s very clear that it’s a sensitive situation at the moment because of the war,” said an informed source. “There are meetings taking place. There are contingency plans that have always been there. They’re being dusted down to see if they need to be updated.”One question under discussion is the prospect of keeping the coal-fired power station at Moneypoint open for up to three years beyond its scheduled 2025 closure while waiting for new gas-fired electricity generation to come on stream. Such a move would undercut efforts to curtail carbon emissions but is increasingly seen as a step that may be necessary to boost reserve generation capacity. The talks come as Russian president Vladimir Putin raised the stakes in the confrontation by signing a decree to halt supply contracts with “unfriendly counties” if they do not pay in roubles from Friday. Big European buyers such as Germany have been refusing to pay in roubles for fear of weakening the impact of sanctions and strengthening the Russian currency. Ireland imports some 75 per cent of its gas, with the bulk of those supplies coming from Norway via the British network and only a small proportion originating in Russia. Although senior figures with knowledge of the talks said that factor provides a good degree of protection to energy supplies in the short term, there was concern even before the Putin decree of Thursday that the situation could spiral beyond control if the war is not settled.Last-resort stepsPeople familiar with the talks in Dublin said the invasion has led senior officials to discuss last-resort steps with industry to decide on the allocation of electricity and gas supplies if the energy flow is interrupted or pricing reaches unsustainable levels.Although hospitals and schools would be a top priority, one business figure said the question of maintaining food supply-chain connectivity had emerged as a big issue because of pressures on the international food supply chain. A Government energy security review, due this summer, is likely to list the possibility of State-owned liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage being developed to facilitate the delivery of reserve supplies, it is understood. Global leaders want to increase LNG imports from the US into Europe to offset demand for Russian energy. But it remains unclear whether Ireland could acquire temporary seaborne storage before building any infrastructure.

Photograph: Nick BradshawA “cultural change” is needed in Irish society where it is considered “impolite” to go to work or school with symptoms that could be Covid-19, the Irish College of General Practitioners has said. Dr Nuala O’Connor, the group’s lead on Covid-19, said it was important to protect the vulnerable in society and that anyone experiencing symptoms should stay at home and wear a mask if they did need to go out.She told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland there were indications that the current wave of the BA.2 variant had peaked. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar last night told RTÉ’s Prime Time it was chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan’s view that “we are close to or past” the peak of the second Omicron wave.“The numbers in hospital are stabilising. Two thirds of people in ICU are not there because of Covid, they just happen to have Covid,” he said. The Fine Gael leader said it was anticipated that the number of people in hospital with the disease would start falling. The number of people in hospital with the disease fell by 63 on Friday morning to 1,472. A further 11,741 Covid-19 infections were reported yesterday.Mr Varadkar also said the seven-day isolation period for those who test positive for Covid-19 would be reviewed but that he “wouldn’t expect a change to that any time soon”. He is just emerging from completing a seven-day isolation period after testing positive for the virus.IsolationThe mooted change to the isolation period was considered at a Cabinet Covid-19 sub committee meeting on Thursday. When asked about possibly reducing the number of isolation days to seven, Dr O’Connor said there was evidence about fewer days of isolation being sufficient and such a change had already been introduced in other jurisdictions. She said she did not think there would be any announcement about this happening in the State in the near future.She said the focus should remain on staying at home if experiencing symptoms and getting booster vaccines. Ireland had a good record on vaccination, but only 75 per cent of the population had received a booster and 50 per cent of seriously ill patients in ICU had not been vaccinated, she added.Any respiratory illness such as flu is an inconvenience and did not carry the risk of serious illness, hospitalisation or death, but there are always vulnerable people in the community who did not have the same level of protection. “As a society we need to protect these people” she said. “Moving forward it is important to have a culture change.”Taoiseach Micheál Martin yesterday drew sharp criticism for dismissing calls for a return to mandatory mask-wearing to try to slow the latest wave.He rejected a joint call from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) and the Irish Association of Emergency Medicine for Government action to curb the spread of the virus in hospitals to help staff exhausted from dealing with multiple waves of the disease.Mr Martin said the public health view was that the BA.2 Omicron variant, while not as virulent as past strains, was so transmissible it was “almost impossible” to stop transmission.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"huge question mark looms over ireland s energy security","story":" Delaying the scheduled closure of the coal-fired power station at Moneypoint is among the measures under consideration. Photograph: Neil WarnerVladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine has already led to surging prices for gas, oil, motor fuel and power since the invasion began in February. Now questions are being raised about the security of supplies as the threat of more western sanctions against the Kremlin and a row over payments cast uncertainty over imports of Russian energy.As if there was any doubt about the intensity of the energy market shock set off by the military campaign, German moves to activate the first phase of an emergency plan that could lead to gas rationing are salutary. The development comes in spite of chancellor Olaf Scholz’s opposition to an EU ban on oil and gas from Russia. That stance will be tested again and again in coming weeks if the Russians dig in for the long haul in Ukraine and there is no deal to end the conflict. Putin is using energy as a lever by insisting on payments for energy in roubles, something western buyers won’t accept because it would dim the impact of financial sanctions and boost the Russian currency.Taoiseach Micheál Martin was at pains to stress in an RTÉ interview on Thursday that he did not speak of winter fuel shortages when he addressed the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party on Wednesday evening. “I simply said that energy security is something we have to focus on and prepare for over the next winter period,” Mr Martin said.FalloutThis question ranks high on the agenda in talks between officials and industry on the fallout from war. Concern has been raised in such engagements, constant since the invasion began, about the stability of supplies next winter when domestic demand for gas and electricity is at its highest and the full brunt of any interruption to Russian supplies would hit markets. That in turn has led people to dust down contingency plans that deal with supply priorities if energy has to be rationed in Ireland.“It’s happening in real time,” said one energy industry figure with knowledge of the talks. “It’s a normal part of looking ahead, looking around the corner at what would need to be done.”Measures discussed to mitigate any supply crunch include the prospect of delaying the 2025 scheduled closure of the giant coal-fired power station at Moneypoint, where the ESB has already resolved to stop using Russian coal in favour of Colombian supplies. People familiar with the discussions are quick to acknowledge that such a move would blunt efforts to reach climate targets, yet the war has changed the debate. “Climate is rather important but the security of supply trumps it,” the energy figure said. Another person, familiar with the thinking in the Coalition, said: “Nobody wants to be in this space.”Liquefied natural gasAnother option under examination is the development of some State-owned liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage capacity. Such an initiative would be separate to plans by the privately-owned US group New Fortress Energy to build a €650 million LNG plant in Co Kerry, which have raised the hackles of the Greens and environmentalists. That plan is before An Bord Pleanála with a decision due in September, but Government policy is opposed to imports of fracked gas.For all that, there is some confidence in industry and official circles that a short-term gas supply crunch can be avoided. The reason for that is the source of Irish supplies, a quarter of which come from the domestic Corrib field on the western coast while the remainder is imported on pipelines into Northern Ireland from Britain, which takes much of its supply from Norway. Although the current proportion of Russian gas supplies into Britain is said to be about 6per cent, a senior business person said it would not take much of an interruption to Russian supplies to distort the UK market at a time of higher seasonal demand for gas.Still, the lesson learned in the weeks since Russian tanks stormed Ukraine is prices can rise rapidly even when gas and oil continue to flow through pipelines. If rocketing prices have created a political difficulty for the Government, any energy rationing would lead to problems of a different order.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"in the news how to manage covid without nphet","story":"CMO Tony Holohan told the Taoiseach in mid-February it was time to disband the emergency team he headed.

Photograph: Norma Burke PA Wire Tom Clonan has said he did not think he would be elected to the Seanad, but that he is now determined to maximise the opportunity to promote the causes with which he has been involved for more than 20 years.The newly-elected Senator for Trinity College, Dublin said it was a “nail biting contest” and a “baptism of fire”.“I didn’t think I’d win at all. I ran as a protest,” he told Newstalk Breakfast.The contest to fill the vacancy created by Ivana Bacik’s election to the Dáil last year involved a number of high-profile candidates including former lord mayor of Dublin Hazel Chu and retired Irish rugby player Hugo MacNeill.They were both eliminated before the 16th and final count which which ended with Mr Clonan taking the seat with 5,358 votes. He won out over psychologist Maureen Gaffney, who ended up with 5,198 votes.Mr Clonan said his son Eoghan (20), a student at Dublin Business School who has a neuromuscular disability called Pelizaeus Merzbacher Disease, was his campaign manager. He said that when Eoghan was diagnosed it was “like Alice falling through the looking glass” as the family moved into a parallel world where they had to fight “for really poor services”.The former Defence Forces member said Ireland is “one of the worst countries in the EU” for disability care and services. “We can do better,” he said. “I want to make things better.”Mr Clonan said that he did not know how long this political career would last, but that he intended to “make some noise” about radical campaigns and to have an impact while it did. He said he could achieve more by being in the place where people make decisions.“It’s great to be inside, not outside the gates,” he added.The security analyst said he supported reforming the Seanad reform and hoped the Government would fulfil its promise to do so.He said “the Senate is very important” as it had the power to hold the Government to account.Mr Clonan expressed disappointment that many who were eligible to vote in the Seanad by-election had not done so. As a Trinity College graduate he was a member of a very privileged group.Of the 70,000 who were eligible to vote only 15,000 had done so.“The most progressive community in the country didn’t vote.

a development that may finally explain why some people develop certain traits and are at greater risk of disease.The size of the missing chunk is so large that scientists say it is the equivalent of deciphering a whole new chromosome.“Finishing the human genome sequence was like putting on a new pair of glasses,” said Dr Karen Miga, of the University of California, Santa Cruz.“Now that we can clearly see everything we are one step closer to understanding what it all means.”The 19-year endeavour to complete the picture has involved scientists from all over the world, including Cambridge University and the Wellcome Sanger Institute.Much of the newly decoded material comes from the centre of chromosomes - or centromeres - and the very tips - the telomeres - both of which are linked to cell ision and the development of cancer and degenerative diseases.The team discovered more than 100 new genes that produce proteins, the molecules which do most of the work in cells and that are required for the structure, function, and regulation of tissues and organs.However, they also found mysterious pockets of non-coding DNA that do not make proteins but still seem to play an important role in cellular functions and may lie at the heart of conditions in which cell ision runs amok, such as cancer.“We are finally digging into what we once called junk DNA, because we could not understand it or look at it accurately,” said Dr Giulio Formenti of the Rockefeller University, New York.“We now know that many diseases are linked to structural repeats in the centromere, and now that these sequences are no longer missing from the human reference genome we can begin to map the origins of these diseases.”To complete the genome, scientists used DNA from a non-cancerous tumour called a hydatidiform mole, which occurs when a human embryo rejects DNA from the mother and instead duplicates DNA from the father.This mistake in fertilisation means the tumour has DNA from just one inidual, making it easier to sequence. This, coupled with advances in genetic sequencing over the past two decades, allowed researchers to fill in the gaps.“You would think that, with 92 per cent of the genome completed long ago another eight per cent wouldn’t contribute much,” said Prof Erich Jarvis of Rockefeller.“But from that missing eight per cent, we’re now gaining an entirely new understanding of how cells ide, allowing us to study a number of diseases we had not been able to get at before.”The breakthrough could also help unpick the origins of humanity. Some of the genes that were missing in the original genome are now thought to be critically important in driving the bigger, more connected brains which separate humans from apes.Researchers also found that the centromeres contained layers of older sequences which appear to be no longer used by the cell but may hold clues to how our DNA worked in the past.“It\u0027s almost like layers of fossils,” said Dr Nicolas Altemose, of University of California, Berkeley.“As you move away from the site of the active centromere you get more and more degraded, to the point where if you go out to the furthest shores of this sea of repetitive sequences you start to see the ancient centromere.”He added: “Before, we just had the blurriest picture of what was there, and now it\u0027s crystal clear.”The research, by members of the Telomere-to-Telomere consortium, was published in six papers in the journal Science.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin says \u0026#39Ukraine air strike on Russia\u0026#39 will hinder peace talksPolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak branded \u0026#39out of touch\u0026#39 as cost-of-living crisis worsensHow South Korea can teach the world to live with CovidApril Fool\u0026#39s Day 2022: how Chaucer, calendar confusion and Hilaria led to pranks and fake newsFrench presidential election 2022: When is it, how does it work and who are the candidates?Just Stop Oil protesters block ten \u0026#39critical\u0026#39 oil terminals on day of energy price risesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jonathan van tam having sleepless nights spring covid booster","story":"Jonathan Van-Tam said he is having sleepless nights worrying about over-75s coming forward for their spring booster jabs on his final appearance as England\u0027s Deputy Chief Medical Officer.Prof Van-Tam, who became one of most familiar faces of the Covid pandemic, announced in January that he would be resigning.Speaking at the Royal Society of Medicine\u0027s Covid conference on Thursday, his last appearance in the role, he said he was optimistic that countries were better prepared to respond to future pandemicsBut he warned: I wouldn\u0027t want anybody to take away from our discussion … the idea that this is over, because case rates here in the UK are really, really high and hospitalisations in London, for example, are becoming exceptionally high again.And what keeps me awake at night is whether the people we have called, over-75s, for their second booster dose are going to come forward really rapidly in the next few days and weeks, because it\u0027s going to be important.His comments come after Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u0027s Chief Scientific Adviser, said four-monthly boosters cannot continue and that it was likely the NHS would move to an annual jab programme.The latest official figures show 15,632 people in England were in hospital with Covid as of Wednesday, up 18 per cent week-on-week and the highest since Jan 19 when the number was 15,742.Average daily hospital admissions in England of people with Covid currently stand at 2,050 – the highest since Feb 5, 2021. But the proportion of hospital patients with Covid in England who are being treated primarily for something else is broadly unchanged at just over half.Across the UK, 19,534 patients were in hospital with Covid as of March 30. The last time that was higher was Jan 17m, when the figure stood at 19,657.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin says \u0026#39Ukraine air strike on Russia\u0026#39 will hinder peace talksPolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak branded \u0026#39out of touch\u0026#39 as cost-of-living crisis worsensHow South Korea can teach the world to live with CovidApril Fool\u0026#39s Day 2022: how Chaucer, calendar confusion and Hilaria led to pranks and fake newsFrench presidential election 2022: When is it, how does it work and who are the candidates?Just Stop Oil protesters block ten \u0026#39critical\u0026#39 oil terminals on day of energy price risesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"keir starmer demands rishi sunak","story":"Keir Starmer demands Rishi Sunak come clean on wes finances and slams smear claimLabours leader slapped back - metaphorically - after Chancellor Rishi Sunak compared himself to Will Smith at the Oscars over questions about his wethis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video starmer-household-doesnt-benefit-russian-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:lQPyuaQJ,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,prebidUseTestRuntime:true,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mantisRecommender.recommenderMaxMpuNumber:,mantisRecommender.autoplayInterval:,nonIframeMantisRecommender:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,amp.trackonomics.enabled:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,mantisRecommender.useIntTracking:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,authUI.default:true,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,adServedMastheadStripEnabled:true,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,mantisRecommender.hbEnabled:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,amp.stickyAdRefresh:,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,M.apiUrl:https:partner-widget-api-prod.tm-awx monitizer  compare prices gbp_en,publicationName:Mirror,mantisRecommender.limit:,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,authUI.version:ffefdecbcae,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,trackonomics.id:reachplc_cDEYX_mirror,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,convoStarterEnabled:true,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The millionaire Tory complained yesterday that questions about his super-rich we Akshata Murthy were not “fair game”.After Will Smith slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars over a joke about his we, Mr Sunak added: “Both Will Smith and me having our wives attacked – at least I didn’t get up and slap anybody, which is good. But Labour ’s leader today said it was a “fundamental question of principle”, in the “public interest” and “not a personal attack”.Keir Starmer told Sky News: “I would have thought the Chancellor would actually want to come clean on this and say actually, ‘I can be very very clear that my household doesn’t benefit from any money that’s come in any way from Russia during this invasion of Ukraine ’.“It’s a simple question, I think he should just answer it, it would actually help his wehe just answered that question.”  Mr Sunak faced questions over his weaposs business affairs following the Spring Statement last week. The Chancellor has urged firms to “think very carefully about their investments in Russia”, adding: “There is no case for new investment in Russia”. Ms Murthy owns a .% stake in Infosys, an IT firm founded by her billionaire father NR Narayana Murthy, which has continued to operate from their Moscow office. Her stake is currently worth £million, while the family hold a combined £.bn shareholding in Infosys - an increase from £.billion that was last reported in .Mr Sunak told theBBC: You know, I think it’s totally fine for people to take shots at me. It’s fair game.I’m the one sitting here and that’s what I signed up for. Actually, it’s very upsetting and, I think, wrong for people to try and come at my we, and you know, beyond that actually, with regard to my father in law, for whom I have nothing but enormous pride and admiration for everything that he’s achieved.  No amount of attempted smearing is going to make me change that because he’s wonderful and has achieved a huge amount, as I said, I’m enormously proud of him. But Labour’s leader said today: “As far as the Chancellor’s we is concerned, there’s just a fundamental question of principle here, which is, is their household benefiting from money made in Russia when the government’s put in place sanctions  “That is in the public interest for us to have an answer to. “I’m not attacking their family, I don’t agree with that way of doing politics. “But I do want to know is, is the Chancellor’s household benefiting from money from a company that’s investing in money when the government’s saying quite rightly that nobody should be doing that ”  The Chancellor has previously said he “followed the ministerial code to the letter” regarding his financial interests. A Treasury spokesman told the Mirror: “The Prime Minister’s independent adviser on ministerial interests has confirmed he is completely satisfied with the Chancellor’s propriety of arrangements and that he has followed the ministerial code to the letter in his declaration of interests.” The Ministerial Code states: “Ministers must provide their Permanent Secretary with a list, in writing, of all relevant interests known to them, which might be thought to give rise to a conflict. “Inidual declarations, and a note of any action taken in respect of inidual interests, are then passed to the Cabinet Office Propriety and Ethics team and the Independent Adviser on Ministers’ Interests.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyInfosysBBCThe TreasurySpring StatementPoliticsBillionaires\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sir Keir said: He told the House no rules were broken in Downing Street during lockdown. The police have now concluded there was widespread criminality. The Ministerial Code says that ministers who knowingly mislead the House should resign. Why is he still here  Boris Johnson scoffed hang on a minute! and accused Keir Starmer of being a human weather vane after the Labour leader stopped short of repeating his call for the PMaposs resignation last week.  The PM said the Met Police - whoaposve warned they could issue more fines beyond the  anonymous ones so far - must “get on with their job” adding: We are going to get on with our job.But Keir Starmer said: There are only two possible explanations.“Either he’s trashing the Ministerial Code, or he’s claiming he was repeatedly lied to by his own advisors and that he didn’t know what was going on in his own house and his own office. “Come off it! “He really does think it’s one rule for him and another rule for everyone  - that he can pass off criminality in his own office and ask others to follow the law.” Labouraposs leader added: When is he going to stop taking the British public for fools  It came after Boris Johnsonaposs deputy today finally admitted  staff broke the law over Covid lockdown parties - after No bizarrely tried to avoid saying they did.Dominic Raab also confirmed ministers like Rishi Sunak will inevitably disclosethey get fined. So far, No has only pledged to name Boris Johnson and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case.Scotland Yard yesterday said it would hand out  fines to people over parties in Downing Street and Whitehall.Yet the PM still appeared to be in denial. Pressed over Mr Johnson’s view, his spokesman said: “It’s for the Met to make that judgment, rather than the Prime Minister.”Today Mr Raab, who is the Justice Secretary and once prosecuted war crimes, accepted the  fined people broke the law saying: Clearly there were breaches of the regulations - that’s the only thing that could warrant the  fixed penalty notices”. Last night Boris Johnson threw a glitzy bash for Tory MPs, hours after the Met confirmed Downing Street lockdown parties had broken the law. The PM hosted around  MPs for dinner at a central London hotel as he attempted to bolster his leadership and draw a line under the Partygate scandal. Politicians were set to dine on salmon tart, chicken thighs and a chocolate praline dessert, washed down with fine wines. Top Tories walked past families who lost loved ones to Covid, who held a candlelit vigil in protest outside Londonaposs Park Plaza hotel and shouted at MPs: Off to another party, are we  One Tory MP, Michael Fabricant, told the waiting media the party would be a lot of fun adding: Itaposs great, we had a photo taken, it was absolutely super. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford blasted: Last night millions of families will have been desperately trying to figure out how they will possibly afford the £ energy price hike that will hit them this Friday. At the very same time, Tory MPs were gathering across the street for a champagne bash in the Park Plaza. We all know the Tories partied during lockdown and now they’re partying through this cost-of-living emergency. Earlier Keir Starmer blasted the PM and “cynical” Chancellor Rishi Sunak for putting the  Tory re-election campaign over and above helping people pay their bills by promising a p income tax cut. The PM insisted he was still a “tax-cutting Conservative” - but Keir Starmer told Mr Johnson to “cut the nonsense and treat the British people with a bit of respect”. He said the Tories were imposing  tax rises, bringing the tax burden to its highest for  years and for every £ taken in tax rises, £ is given back. “Is that cutting taxes or is it raising taxes ” he mocked. Boris Johnson fumed: “I don’t know where he’s been the last two years…. “Even for Captain Hindsight, to obliterate the biggest pandemic for the last century from his memory, to obliterate the £bn we’ve had to spend… is quite extraordinary.” But Keir Starmer said: “I can only hope that his police questionnaire was bit more convincing than that. This year British people face the worst fall in living standards on record. While they are counting every penny, the Prime Minister is hitting them with higher taxes.“But in  when there just so happens to be a general election, they will introduce a small tax cut. That is not taking dficult decisions, itaposs putting the Tory re-election campaign over and above helping people pay their bills. How did he find a Chancellor as utterly cynical as he is  Prime Minister Boris Johnson replied: What we have is a Chancellor who took the tough decisions to look after the UK economy throughout the pandemic, who protected people up and down the land with £ billion worth of support. And by the way,we had listened to them,we had listened to Captain Hindsight, we would not have come out of lockdown in July last year. We would have stayed in lockdown over Christmas and New Year, with the result that the UK economy would not be growing in the way that it is. And so we would not be able to make the investments that we now are and under Labour we would have to tax more and borrow more and they cannot be trusted with the economy.

But the plans have already been criticised, with unions saying ministers have not gone far enough and the British Ports Association pointing out ports cannot enforce wage rules. Mr Shapps also outlined plans to close minimum wage loopholes and clampdown on fire and rehire practices. He will ask the Insolvency Service to consider disqualying PO chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite from acting as a company director, after the boss brazenly admitted to MPs the firm broke the law by not consulting with unions or notying the government. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “This plan has gaping holes. It won’t deliver a fair outcome for the  sacked workers, and it won’t stop another PO-style scandal.  “Closing the legal loophole which lets companies pay less than the minimum wage is a start, but we need much more from the Government. “Ministers must do everything they can to ensure PO reinstate staff on their previous pay – a union-negotiated rate that is signicantly higher than the national minimum wage. “That means severing all ties with DP World, including lucrative freeport contracts. “Andministers really want to stop companies firing at will, they must go further than a feeble statutory code and finally deliver the long-promised Employment Bill to boost worker protections. “Without stronger employment legislation, bad bosses will continue to trample over workers’ rights.”  British Ports Association, Richard Ballantyne, added: While itaposs right the government and the ferry industry look to improve employment rules and standards, the expectation that port authorities will need to enforce minimum wage rules in the shipping sector could be unworkable. This will place ports in a dficult legal predicament, especially before any legislation is in place. DP World-owned PO Ferries sacked its crews and replaced them with agency workers on March . The minimum wage in the UK for people aged  and over is £. per hour. Mr Hebblethwaite, whose basic annual salary is £,, told MPs on March  that the average pay of the agency crew is £. per hour, but insisted this was permitted under international maritime laws. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Shapps said: “Where new laws are needed, we will create them. Where legal loopholes are cynically exploited, we will close them. And where employment rights are too weak, we will strengthen them.” Mr Shapps said HM Revenue  Customs will dedicate “signicant resource” to ensure all UK ferry operators are “compliant with the national minimum wage, no s, no buts”.Employers will be prevented from using “ fire and rehire tactics”they fail to make “reasonable efforts to reach agreement through consultation”, the Transport Secretary said.Mr Shapps added of the proposals: “It’ll send a clear message thatyou are using British waters and British ports to ply your trade then you must accept British laws.” Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh told the Commons that the steps announced by the Government to “insist on the bare minimum cannot come a moment too soon”. PO Ferries has accused the Maritime and Coastguard Agencyof operating with “an unprecedented level of rigour” after it detained two of its ships. European Causeway was held in Larne, Northern Ireland, on Friday, while Pride Of Kent was detained in Dover, Kent, on Monday.  Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, was also unimpressed with the plans, saying: “Despite all the bluster, Grant Shapps has failed to grasp the opportunity to adequately stand up to the banditry behaviour of PO. “The Prime Minister repeatedly said to Parliament that the Government would be taking legal action to save British seafarers’ jobs, but he has failed to keep his word. “This continued lack of action and courage has meant a ferry company owned by the Dubai royal family has been able to break our laws and disrupt our ports and ruin people’s lives with impunity, and we will keep pressing the Government to ensure justice for our members. “What has been announced today is far too little, too late, and we are calling for urgent action for speedier, more radical reforms to save the UK seafarer from oblivion.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Tories are either blind to the misery they are overseeing or completely indferent to itRishi Sunak could have helped Brits with last weeks Spring Statement Image: via REUTERSopinionByVoice of the Mirror:,  Apr |commentsHome across the land are this morning braced for a fresh wave of economic pain. Water bills are going up, council taxes are rising and energy bills are set to increase by more than %. The hike in National Insurance contributions will soon follow.All this against a backdrop of runaway inflation, stagnant wages and soaring food and fuel costs. Families already struggling face a grim future as the crisis really starts to bite.The Tories are either blind to the misery they are overseeing or completely indferent to it.Chancellor Rishi Sunak had a chance in last week’s spring statement to help us through this storm. The Government did not have to sit on the sidelines. It was not powerless to act.It could have raised pensions and benefits in line with inflation. It could have imposed a windfall tax on the oil and gas giants. It could have halted the National Insurance rise coming into force on April . The fact the Chancellor opted for the bare minimum shows not only how little he understands stricken families but also displays callous disregard for consequences of poverty. This is a crisis made in Downing Street. Hard-up Britain is paying the price.  Curb killers Three young people have been killed by out-of-control dogs in less than a month. These tragic deaths are even more upsetting because they were preventable. They happened because of a failure to control ownership of dangerous dogs. Laws could have been strengthened to stop the sale and breeding of aggressive breeds. There could have been tougher penalties for owners who fail to control their lethal animals. How many more deaths will it require before ministers act  No Snickering A quarter of young people would rather have a choc bar than sex. Apparently it’s how they get their Twix these days.

The Chancellor complained that his we Akshata Murthy was not fair game following scrutiny over her shares in a company operating in Russia.He admitted he had not had the best of weekends following last weekaposs Spring Statement, which was widely criticised for not doing enough to help Brits hit by the cost of living crisis.Mr Sunak compared himself to the Hollywood actor, who slapped comedian Chris Rock at the Oscars for making a joke about his we Jada Pinkett Smith.Will Smith appeared to lose his temper when the comedian made a gag about his weaposs shaved head. She has previously spoken about deciding to cut her hair as she suffers from alopecia. Speaking to the BBCaposs Newscast podcast, Mr Sunak said: Someone said, aposJoe Root, Will Smith, and me – not the best of weekends for any of us.apos  But I feel, on reflection, both Will Smith and me having our wives attacked – at least I didn’t get up and slap anybody, which is good. Mr Sunak faced questions over his weaposs business affairs following the Spring Statement last week. Ms Murthy owns a .% stake in Infosys, an IT firm founded by her father NR Narayana Murthy, which has continued to operate from their Moscow office. Her stake is currently worth £million, while the family hold a combined £.bn shareholding in Infosys - an increase from £.billion that was last reported in .Mr Sunak told the BBC: You know, I think it’s totally fine for people to take shots at me. It’s fair game.I’m the one sitting here and that’s what I signed up for. Actually, it’s very upsetting and, I think, wrong for people to try and come at my we, and you know, beyond that actually, with regard to my father in law, for whom I have nothing but enormous pride and admiration for everything that he’s achieved.  No amount of attempted smearing is going to make me change that because he’s wonderful and has achieved a huge amount, as I said, I’m enormously proud of him. The Chancellor has previously said he “followed the ministerial code to the letter” regarding his financial interests. A Treasury spokesman told the Mirror: “The Prime Minister’s independent adviser on ministerial interests has confirmed he is completely satisfied with the Chancellor’s propriety of arrangements and that he has followed the ministerial code to the letter in his declaration of interests.” The Ministerial Code states: “Ministers must provide their Permanent Secretary with a list, in writing, of all relevant interests known to them, which might be thought to give rise to a conflict. “Inidual declarations, and a note of any action taken in respect of inidual interests, are then passed to the Cabinet Office Propriety and Ethics team and the Independent Adviser on Ministers’ Interests.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BBCRishi Sunak\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Keir Starmer said the government “just doesn’t get” it as Kit Malthouse said his family is finding it “quite tricky... day-to-day”.The North West Hampshire MP made the comment on the same day he receives a £,-a-year pay rise for MPs. Speaking in front of a burning fireplace in his home, the father-of-three told LBC Radio: As you know, Iaposve got children. They need to be fed and that cost is rising. My fuel prices are rising quite signicantly, and I have to say that in my constituency Iaposm on oil central heating still, sadly. He added: We are feeling it very signicantly.The fact a government minister in the wealthiest % of taxpayers is struggling will ramp up furious pressure on Rishi Sunak to announce more help.Last week the Chancellor made National Insurance thresholds more generous and unveiled a temporary fuel duty cut - but neither will help the worst-paid part time workers with no car as incomes drop by the fastest since records began in the s.  He has already announced a £ council tax discount that not everyone is eligible for, and a £ energy bills discount that only comes in October and must be paid back. Keir Starmer blasted the Government’s “pathetic” response as National Insurance, energy bills, council tax and inflation all soar - with bills expected to jump again on October . Energy firms’ websites crashed yesterday as people submitted meter readings ahead of today’s £ surge in annual bills. Charities said the rise will double the number of ‘fuel stress’ families struggling to pay the gas bill to million. The TUC demanded an emergency budget with general secretary Frances O’Grady saying: “This is a living standards emergency. Last week’s Spring Statement was woefully inadequate.” And parents told Save the Children they would be giving their children shared baths and cold dinners, or even sending them to bed hungry. Bethany Fern, a -year-old single mum to a seven-year-old and three-year-old from Southport, told the charity: “Iaposm going to try and cut back even more on what we spend on food and try to freeze more.“We’ll be eating a lot more cold meals, triple-checking that plugs are turned offnot being used and limiting TV even more than we already do. “We already have the heating off a lot, and my children rely on extra layers, duvets and weighted blankets. “They have to have shared baths or not fresh baths between each other to preserve the boiler from heating water.” Another single mum-of-three, who works full time, told LBC Radio she keeps her kids warm with hot water bottles, can only afford one meal a day and eats their leftovers.Heating oil - used by many rural homes and not subject to the price cap on gas and electric bills - has rocketed in price after Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine and peaked at p a litre last month.Minister and father-of-three Mr Malthouse said: “Lots of people in rural areas are suffering from the oil price rise. So we are feeling it very signicantly.“I have to confess to you, we did convert last year to electric vehicles, so we are feeling the electric price but not through the petrol. So it is a challenge for everybody. Mr Malthouse earns £, as an MP following a .% rise today. Together with his salary as Policing Minister he earns £, a year.He said his family tradition was to have the heating off from April  - but with Britain hit by late Spring snow and ice, he had lit a fire in his fireplace.Mr Malthouse had been asked directly what other “economies” he was having to make in his household. He insisted Chancellor Rishi Sunak could act again, but warned the UK had “huge debt” and it would only happen “ the economy allows”. He said: “He is monitoring it on a daily basis,he needs to move further in the future,the economy allows us to do that, don’t forget we’re carrying huge debts at the moment, then I know he’ll look very seriously at doing so.” Save the Children director Dan Paskins blasted the government’s response - including raising benefits by just .%, half the inflation rate - “isn’t good enough”. He said: “The rise in energy prices will be devastating for families on low incomes. “We’ve already seen families having to choose between heating their homes and feeding their children. “These price rises will undoubtedly leave millions of parents wondering how they will be able to cope in the months ahead. Unless families are provided with more support, this increase in energy bills will leave more children living in cold and damp homes, going to bed hungry, and missing out on the opportunities they need to grow and thrive.” One working single mum who remained anonymous told the charity: “I actually feel physically sick. I feel pressurised to work more hours even when Iaposm already working as much as I can.“I often do more work after my daughter goes to bed to make the most of the time I have without it affecting her.” Labour leader Keir Starmer blasted: I think most people are clear that ... the Government really needed to step up in its Spring Statement last week.“They failed to do so and their response is frankly pathetic on a very, very dficult day for millions of people. “Energy bills are going up far more than weaposve ever seen on record. People are really struggling and I just donapost think the Government gets it.  Government minister Kit Malthouse said: I canapost pretend to you it isnapost tough. It is going to be.” Labour’s leader urged ministers to examine hiking benefits by the rate of inflation - .% and set to peak at almost % - instead of .% now which is a real-terms cut. As the cost-of-living crisis intensied, the Labour leader said people were “tossing and turning in their beds about how they’re going to pay for this”. He said people are “seeing nothing from the government”, who “don’t realise” how badly people are struggling. He added he was hearing of people keeping the heating at C as they canapost afford any more. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year. But askedbenefits should rise in line with inflation, Mr Starmer stopped short of giving a guarantee that they would under a Labour government.Instead he told Sky News:: “I think we’ve got to look at it for that very reason because otherwise people fall behind.“That’s what we wanted to see from the Government last week, that’s what we didn’t see from the Government last week. “Frankly,the Government put a package on the table that Parliament could agree we could get on with this. “But the Government just doesn’t get the scale of the problem for millions and millions of people.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Trades Union CongressConservative PartyLabour PartyNational Insurance Company Ltd.Save the ChildrenKit MalthouseSpring StatementSnowCouncil taxEnergy billsLiving standardsOil pricesPrice risesSingle mumPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However, critics have called for the review to be reopened and more money to be pumped into the armed forces following the outbreak of war in Europe. Defending the study, Adm Sir Tony told Whitehall’s Institute for Government think-tank: “It rightly identied Russia as an acute threat, it reinforced that the way that we best protect our national security against that particular threat is through collective defence - and we are in the world’s most powerful military alliance, called NATO.”  The former First Sea Lord said British troops “must be more active and engaged in the world” to “protect and advance the national interest and our shared democratic values”. Rivals were trying to “challenge and undermine the international, rules-based system here in Europe and where”, warned the naval officer.  He also launched a blistering personal attack on the Russian President, whom he branded “a weaker and more diminished figure today than he was a month ago”. “In many ways, Putin has already lost,” said Adm Sir Tony, . “Far from being the far-sighted manipulator of events that he would have us believe, Putin has damaged himself through a series of catastrophic misjudgements. “He has failed to recognise how deeply the notions of sovereignty, democracy and national identity have taken root in Ukraine.  “Like all authoritarians, he allowed himself to be misled as to his own strength, including the effectiveness of the Russian armed forces. “He has failed to anticipate the unity and cohesion that exists among the free nations of the world, here in Europe and obviously far beyond. “His actions to date have done more to galvanise than ide and have shown Ukraine to have the one thing that Russia conspicuously lacks, which is real friends.” Adm Sir Tony described NATO as “stronger and more united than at any time I can remember”.

The lavish party at a posh London hotel must have cost £,, but who’s bothered when your future as Prime Minister is at stake  Partygate, shmartygate. The only party he cares about is the Conservative Party, and his leadership of it. His sense of timing is immaculate. With chilling contempt, he partied on the eve of Prince Philip’s funeral, while the Queen was in mourning. He partied on the day Her Majesty paid her last respects to her husband in Westminster Abbey. This is a politician utterly without shame, honour or decency. Like % of Mirror readers, I think he should go.  He partied while victims of Covid lay dying in hospital, with access to their bedside denied to family and friends. He partied while the nation was under virtual house arrest – on his orders. His minions carted suitcases of booze back to Downing Street to keep the party going into the small hours, while grieving parents, sons and daughters wept over their lost loved ones. Tomorrow is April Fool’s Day. Blustering Boris Johnson thinks he can fool all of the people all of the time, and get away with it. We must show that we haven’t forgotten or forgiven, and hold this apology of a man to account at the ballot box, starting with the local and regional elections on May .  ******* The most popular foreign destination to propose is the Greek island of Santorini, then Barbados, Crete, Mauritius and Antigua at sunset, says a new survey. My proposal was at night, in the winter, hiding behind a brick shed on a football pitch on Eastmoor estate, Wakefield. That was because we weren’t allowed to meet, forcibly separated and unable to marry because of my father’s opposition. I don’t recall actually asking my pregnant girlfriend to marry me , but I turned up with an engagement ring. And that was it. Next week, we celebrate  years of marriage. I advise over-romantic swains to save their money and find a quiet football pitch. And don’t forget my First Law of Matrimony: the durability of the marriage is in inverse proportion to the cost of the wedding. ******* A theatregoer walked out of York Theatre Royal’s As You Like It, whinging about the actors’ Yorkshire accents. The management was unapologetic. Forthcoming attractions include: ‘Ey up, ‘Amlet, T’Merchant o’Bratfud, Much Ado About Nowt, The Taming of the Ferret, T’Merrie Wives of Wakey, and The Two Gentlemen of Pontefract. Tickets  bob, or three Tetley bottle tops. Whippets left at the door, please. ******* And the Oscar for the Best Slap goes to... I was going to watch the Hollywood extravaganza, but switched to Midsomer Murders. Much less violence. Tinseltown is traumatised, but I think comedian Chris Rock had it coming to him.

Laura Jordan said her son Zac, now five, has spent so much time in the house that heaposs now scared to go outside. She was shocked to discover that councils are not required to get kids back into schoolthey are expelled before their fth birthday. The boy was booted out of Holly Hill Church School, in Rubery, Worcs, in October after a number of behaviour problems, including attacks on other pupils and staff.But his mum, , believes he has undiagnosed special educational needs that canapost be dealt with in mainstream schools.Worcestershire County Council has since apologised for failing to find a suitable school for Zac and said it is working with his mum to get him back into education. Laura, from Redditch, Worcs, told The Mirror: Zac started reception in September and within five weeks he had been permanently excluded.Ever since heaposs been out of school as he was only four and the compulsory school age is five. Itaposs very rare for this to happen to a child his age.Itaposs pure discrimination, the whole thing. I donapost think itaposs morally right heaposs out of school when people the same age as him are able to go to school. Heaposs been left behind because heaposs been excluded and offered no alternative schooling provision.Heaposs missed out on his education. This is going to affect him for the rest of his le.Laura said Zac has become increasingly isolated following his exclusion last October.  She added: I canapost even get him to leave the house. I have to force him to leave just to go to the shops. He used to be happy outside the house. Now he doesnapost want to leave and thataposs because heaposs not mixing with kids his age.The mum-of-two does not deny that her son has issues, accepting that he attacked other children and staff at his school. However, she believes he has autism, ADHD and speech and language problems which make certain situations aposoverwhelmingapos for him. Laura added: He was excluded because heaposs got special educational needs and the school was not able to meet his needs. They couldnapost keep him and others safe. But they couldaposve done other things before resorting to excluding him. This wouldaposve involved a possible managed move or alternative provision.  Ultimately, they didnapost give him chance or time to adjust to his environment or the new staff in his classroom.She added that Worcestershire County Council has to find Zac a new school by April after he turned five in February. The mum said: Itaposs down to the local authority to find an alternative school for him. They have requested two special needs schools but they said they are full. The council now want him in a local mainstream school. If the school accepts him, he will have no choice but to go there.I fear he will be excluded againhe is chucked into another mainstream school and we will be on this never ending cycle of him going to schools and getting excluded. Laura now thinks the UKaposs compulsory school age should be lowered to four-years-old so children cannot be expelled and left at home once they have started education. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Suspensions and permanent exclusions should only be used as a last resort, but we back headteachers to suspend or exclude pupils where it is necessary and helps maintain calm classrooms. “We are consulting on changes to behaviour and exclusions guidance to make sure this is used in a fair way, and the cross-government SEND Review will further consult on how children with special educational needs and disabilities are supported by the system, including in alternative provision.” Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Local authorities are responsible for arranging full-time education for excluded pupils once they reach compulsory school age.Worcestershire County Councilaposs cabinet member for education Marcus Hart said: “Parent carers have a statutory right to ask for a particular educational setting and support for their child but it can at times be challenging to find the right place that has capacity and can meet a child’s inidual needs. The law requires all children to start full-time education by the beginning of the term following their fth birthday and we are working with Ms Jordan to find a suitable and appropriate school that meets Zac’s assessed needs, ready for him to start school in April. We are sorry that we have been unable to source an educational provision for Zac that has been able to meet his needs for this period and we acknowledge this is unacceptable for Zac, indeed for any child. We are continuing to work alongside Ms Jordan and relevant healthcare providers and partners to ensure that we have a high quality, lawful Educational Health and Care Plan in place for Zac, that will help to ensure he receives the tailored help and support he needs at all stages of his educational journey.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Children SchoolsSchools\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The monstrous killer, who is being held in Wakefield Prison, has already spent  years living in solitary confinement in a glass cage after he was deemed too dangerous to be around other prisoners. But although heaposs previously complained his interment reminded him of a traumatic childhood, it has been reported heaposs now quite content living in the underground box. Speaking in a new documentary aposHMP Wakefield: Evil Behind Barsapos Maudsleyaposs nephew Gavin said his uncle is perfectly happy.  He added his softly spoken, well-read uncle would kill againhe was ever released back into society. Maudsley, from Toxteth, Liverpool, was just  when he committed his first murder in .  For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here The serial killer, who had been working as a rent boy at the time, butchered one of his clients, John Farrell. The murder was so violent, cops named him blue because of the colour of his face. Maudsley was arrested and eventually convicted of murder. He was jailed with the recommendation he should never be released. When he was first locked up Maudsley was sent to Broadmoor Hospital, which houses some of the UKaposs most violent prisoners. After three relatively quiet years behind bars, the serial killer seized an opportunity to attack child molester David Francis in , with the help of fellow prisoner David Cheeseman. The pair barricaded themselves in a cell with Francis before spending the next nine hours brutally torturing the sex offender to death. During the attack, Maudsley shoved a spoon so far into Francisaposs ear, it wedged into his brain.  After the killing, for which he was convicted of manslaughter, he was deemed too dangerous to stay in Broadmoor and was transferred to Wakefield Prison. But Maudsleyaposs streak for vigilante violence continued and after heaposd settled into his new cell the following year, he strangled and stabbed we-killer Salney Darwood and hid the body under his bed. Thirsty for more blood, he hunted prison corridors for his next victim - Bill Roberts, who had been jailed for sexually abusing a seven-year-old girl. He stabbed Roberts to death before hacking at his skull with a makesht dagger. After the bloodshed, Maudsley calmly walked up to a prison guard and chillingly said there would be two fewer people at dinner that night. His rampage rung alarm bells for prison bosses who deemed him too dangerous to mix with the general prison population and a special cell was constructed to keep him in. The cell, which was completed in , was dubbed the glass cage - as it resembled Anthony Hopkinsapos cell in Silence of the Lambs. At .mx.m, itaposs surrounded by bulletproof glass which prison guards peer into to keep a close eye on him.  The only furniture is a table and a chair, which are both made of compressed cardboard, while his toilet and sink are bolted to the floor. The door of the cell is made of solid steel, which opens into a cage just inside. Maudsleyaposs bed is a concrete slab. The see-through walls contain a slit, through which guards pass him meals and other things he needs. Spending his days entombed in the cell, Maudsley is allowed one hour of exercise per day. When he goes to the exercise yard, heaposs escorted by six guards and he never has access to other inmates. When interviewed, Maudsley said he felt tortured in solitary confinement and claimed his speech has suffered from never speaking to anyone. He said: I feel no officer takes any interest in me and theyaposre only concerned with when to open the door and then to make sure I get back in my cell as soon as possible. I think an officer could stop and talk a bit but they never do and itaposs these thoughts that I think about most of the time. But in a letter to Gavin, , he claimed he is happy and content in the box and has warned killing will be on his mindheaposs ever released. Maudsley has claimed the confinement has given him flashbacks to his childhood, when he was regularly locked away and beaten. The serial killer had an abusive childhood at the hands of his father. After being dumped in an orphanage as an infant, his parents brought him and his  siblings home when he was eight. He was regularly hit and often took extra beatings to protect his siblings. Once, he was locked in a room for six months, with his only human contact coming from beatings from his dad. In the year  Maudsley asked for the terms of his imprisonment to be relaxed - begging for a pet budgie or,that request was denied, a cyanide capsule so he could end his le. Both requests were turned down, leaving him to live out his days in the glass cell underneath Wakefield Prison.

Maureen Renny, the former head of the independent fee-paying Barn School, left her £.milion seven-bed detached house to her family. However, Leigh Voysey, , claims it was left to her to save it from developers. The sprawling Hill House in Much Hadham, Herts, was the site of The Barn School until . Ms Voysey started attending the school in , when she was eight. The mum-of-one claims Mrs Renny had always favoured her, giving her the best parts in class plays, and that she reconnected with her old mentor by chance during the last three years of her le.She claims the former head asked her to write out a will and organise a friend to sign it on Mrs Rennyaposs behalf in September  over fears it would be sold to developersleft to her blood family. Ms Voysey claims Mrs Renny knew she loved the old schoolhouse as much as she did and decided to leave her everything. Mrs Rennyaposs cousins and the children of her stepson had stood to inherit it from a  will.  Now Mrs Rennyaposs relatives are fighting Ms Voyseaposs bid to claim the fortune in Londonaposs High Court. They have accused the former head girl of faking the  will. Mrs Renny died, aged , in January , four months after the new will to leave her £.million estate to the former pupil was allegedly made, court documents say. The  will ide the estate between her cousins Gillian Ayre, Angela Eastwood and Susan Vickers, and the children of her stepson, Thomas and Katherine Renny. Ms Voysey claims she bonded with her former headteacher after visiting her as a carer and then a friend in . She claims she wrote her distant blood relatives out of her will because she feared they would sell the old schoolhouse to developers. She claims Mrs Renny asked her to write out the will and have it signed on her behalf because she could not do so herself due to problems with her eyesight.  In papers lodged with the court, she says: Mrs Renny remembered exactly who I was, even though it was  years since Iaposd left her school. Mrs Renny told me that sheaposd been asking about me during the years since I had left her school. The whole experience that day was very touching. I worked one more sht as a carer for Mrs Renny, then visited her as a friend after that. After reconnecting in February , I visited Mrs Renny when I could... approximately three to four times a year. When I visited Mrs Renny, I would make us both a cup of tea and we would talk about my time when I was at The Barn. We both enjoyed that immensely. During one of my visits, she asked me what I thought about The Barn, i.e. Hill House, and I said I loved it. Mrs Renny said to me aposI hope it never gets built onapos.  Ms Voysey said the former headteacher says she wanted to leave her estate to her in a new will. In September , Mrs Renny arranged for two of the former head girlsapos pals to witness a new will because she didnapost want her family to know she was doing a new one, it has been claimed. In the papers, Ms Voysey says: Mrs Renny asked me to complete the  will and dictated to me what she wanted to be written on it. Mrs Renny was unable to sign the will herself as she had problems with her eyesight. Kate Selway QC, representing Mrs Rennyaposs family, says in the defence to the action: It is the defendantsapos case that the  will was the deceasedaposs last true will. The  will is invalid because it was procured by the claimantaposs fraudulent conduct. It is denied that the claimant had any ongoing acquaintance with the deceased after leaving The Barn School. It is averred that the only other material time that the deceased and the claimant met was on th February  when the claimant was working as a carer... and worked a lunchtime sht looking after the deceased that day. The claimant cared for the deceased only once for a few hours over lunchtime on th February . The claimant undertook no more shts as a carer for the deceased and never visited the deceased again. It is denied that the deceased made the  will or any will leaving her estate to the claimant. The alleged events said by the claimant to have taken place...never happened. The deceased never signed the  will. The  will was completed in the claimantaposs handwriting and allegedly witnessed by two friends of the claimant who were not known to the deceased. The barrister says it was impossible for the blank will to have been on the table when Ms Voysey arrived, since Mrs Renny was so frail she could not get out of her chair or even hold a telephone. Ms Voysey claimed: I think it was more important to Mrs Renny that she left her estate to me to save The Barn Hill House and the surrounding land from development rather than leave her estate to her distant blood relatives. She further claimed the former head told her she had rejected a £m offer from developers for the land and house. Ms Selway is also raising an alternative defence to the claim, stating that Mrs Renny lacked the testamentary capacity to execute the will and did not know or approve of its contents, evenit wasnapost faked. She had a stroke in July  and subsequently was recorded in the careraposs notes as talking gibberish, confused about money, vulnerable, delusional and largely living in the past. The family also say that, evenshe proves her case, Ms Voysey should not be entitled to recover money already distributed from the estate. There is currently £, remaining undistributed.

Among them were the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs older children Prince George and Princess Charlotte.However, their youngest child Prince Louis, aged three, stayed at home and did not join his parents and older siblings.But royal fans have spotted a clue that Kate and William may have considered taking Louis with them.On Twitter, Patricia Treble noted that the Court Circular, the official record of the Royal Familyaposs activities, had included Prince Louisapos name as attending the service - although it had TBCbeside it. She wrote: Interesting nugget in the Court Circular, aposPrince Louis of Cambridge [TBC]apos. Sure, he turns  next month but that would have been a long service for such a young boy. It was also picked up on the account Gertaposs Royals, with one royal fan saying: Itaposs got TBC after Prince Louis so it possible he was going, but at the last minute plans changed.

However, Gertaposs Royals wrote: Prince Louis’s name was likely just an error. I don’t think he was ever scheduled to attend. The Court Circular has now been updated to show that Louis did not attend - only George and Charlotte. Even though he made his public debut on the steps of the Lindo Wing with his parents at just a few hours old, Louis, who is four later this month, has been growing up away from the spotlight. Itaposs partly down to the Covid- pandemic, which has seen large-scale Royal Family events such as Trooping the Colour, cancelled in recent years.And this has also played a part in causing him to fail to hit one major royal milestone - going on an overseas tour. Louis has yet to go on a royal tour, which is mainly due to the travel restrictions that were in place for large parts of  and .Louisapos older siblings George and Charlotte were both considerably younger than their little brother when they went on their first overseas tour. George went on his first royal tour when he was just nine months old, visiting Australia and New Zealand with his proud parents. Charlotte made her royal tour debut in  when she joined the family on a visit to Canada at  months.

Eligibility criteria apply. aposWe had loads of jobs but not enough people to fill themapos Screenprinting business Paul Bristow Associates is just one of the employers who’ve worked with Jobcentre Plus to fill vacancies. The family-run firm, based in Wrexham, produces textiles including T-shirts and printed bags – and they’ve been keen to attract younger people to roles. “One of the issues we have is the perception of manufacturing as being something we used to do in the Victorian age but no longer,” says director Ben Bristow. “Of course that’s not the case – but it made it hard to attract young people. Working with Jobcentre Plus gave us the ability to get more young people into the business and provide them with a good grounding in print and textiles.  “Our staff collaborated really well with the team at Jobcentre Plus, who gave excellent support and deserve high praise indeed.” HR manager Lee Dixon, , agrees: “The people who work there have done a fantastic job. It’s not been easy through Covid and the fact they’ve managed to help people into work is great. “It’s also massively helpful to us as an employer, given there are loads of jobs but not enough people to fill them. Through working with the team at Jobcentre Plus we’ve built up a great rapport. They’ve been first-class. “Our recruits have been a massive help in bringing in valuable skills to our business,” says Lee. “We’ve had them working in packing, admin, sewing and sales. Another guy has got a position in sustainability after he joined us from university. We’ve also had people with additional learning needs and disabilities.”apos My team made me feel very welcome and supported me apos “When I left college in January  I didn’t finish my A levels because I wanted a change, but then obviously the pandemic happened. I didn’t particularly know what I wanted to do, but I knew I would be good in a computer-based job because it’s something that I’ve gravitated towards. “Then I saw JD Sports was advertising opportunities and I thought I’d go for it because it was an administration role in a big company. It was actually the first that I applied for and everything went through really quickly – and I got the job. “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel very welcome and supported me. Day to day I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me pretty much a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since. “I’d always had an interest in HR, but after working for six months I realised it was what I wanted to do. “There was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD and CIPD Level  in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year and I’m really enjoying it. Starting work was quite tough, but I’ve got so much support from my team. It’s a lot more friendly than I expected it to be.“Now I’m learning about dferent parts of HR, building on what I was doing before. I was struggling to find any job with noexperience, but now I’ll just keep going.”Peter Cowgill, executive chairman of JD Sports, on how the company has forged links with Jobcentre Plus. “We are proud to have worked with Jobcentre Plus to provide much-needed employment and learning and development opportunities at a time when competition for job positions has been at an all-time high. Social inequality has only been exacerbated during the pandemic, so it has never been more vital to give young people a chance to succeed. “Our relationship with the DWP now covers all three nations across the UK and gives our stores, head office and distribution centres access to new talent pipelines and initiatives, which not only facilitates our future recruitment needs, but also allows us to support candidates facing social barriers, an area we are hugely passionate about.” “When I was developing my start-up in the renewable energy sector, working with Jobcentre Plus allowed me to recruit new graduates. “We’re part of the Edinburgh Business School incubator, where we get office space, mentoring and support. Since the graduates joined, we’ve moved to the stage of building a prototype.“If it wasn’t for the scheme, recruitment would have been years away –and having a few more minds to work on the concept has given us a competitive edge.“The candidates knew when they joined that they wouldn’t just be working on their own tasks and would be learning something every single day. If you’re looking for experience, it’s a great way to get it.”apos It’s important to personalise our service apos “Our service helps employers and our customers meet each other face to face, which is crucial. Employer advisers speak to both employers and the Work Coaches, who’ll send customers over who are ready for work. “We can also help employers st through CVs and hold training events to get people work-ready and match them up with the role they’ve got available. “I’ve been working closely with Lee at Paul Bristow Associates, who came along to events at the jobcentre where groups of young people could come and speak to him about what roles they had available. “A lot of employers weren’t aware of all the great services we offer, but the feedback we’ve been getting has all been really positive. Every employer’s needs are slightly dferent, so personalising our service is really important. “There are lots of sectors that are struggling to fill places, so we can help companies find a pool of candidates. We have large manufacturing areas in North Wales that are struggling to recruit people. There are also plenty of roles in the hospitality and care sectors.”Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Department for Work and PensionsJD SportsLee DixonJobs CentreMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"man cycled around city randomly","story":"Man cycled around city randomly stabbing women after being stood up by dateDermott McIlveen randomly stabbed six women in Belfast as he cycled past them in what a judge called a \"violent rampage\" following a date where he was stood up and felt humiliatedDermott McIlveen stabbed six women in a violent rampage Image: Police handoutByAshleigh McdonaldTim HanlonNews Reporter:,  Apr |comments A man who went on a violent rampage cycling around Belfast and randomly stabbing women after being stood up by a date, has been jailed. Dermott McIlveen attacked six women in October  during a two hour period due to feeling humiliated and that women were responsible for the problems he had in his le, reported BelfastLive. The defendant appeared via a videolink from Maghaberry prison at Belfast Crown Court where it emerged he was arrested after family members who saw a police appeal about the attacks got in contact. McIlveen, , admitted a total of seven offences committed on October , , with the charges include wounding, attempted wounding and possession of a kne with intent to commit wounding. As he imposed a sentence of nine years in custody followed by a period of three years extended licence, Judge Patrick Kinney QC spoke of the impact the attacks have had on all six victims.  He said: There is a need to protect women from violence by men such as the defendant. McIlveen, who was diagnosed with autism as a child, cycled round the streets of Belfast City Centre on a pushbike attacking women over a two-hour period. The first victim noticed a man on a bike in the Cathedral Quarter, and after walking to McDonaldaposs, she saw the same cyclist. She noticed he had a metal object in his hand, he bumped into her and short time later she noticed blood running down her leg and a cut to her right buttock. The second woman was walking home from work and was attacked at a set of traffic lights on Ormeau Avenue. After McIlveen approached her and stared at her, he jabbed her in her left arm before cycling off. A third victim was with a friend in Donegall Square West. A bicycle came behind her, and as she stepped over to let him past he stabbed her in the neck.  Another woman was in Bedford Street around .pm when a male on a bike hit her on the back of the head. Then McIlveenaposs next attack was on a woman as she walked along Dunluce Avenue, and on this occasion he punched his victim in the throat. The final assault occurred around pm on University Street, when McIlveen brushed up against a woman as he cycled past her and stabbed her in the hip. Crown barrister David Russell said that following the attacks, police launched an extensive investigation. CCTV images of the attacker were released in a media campaign, and after recognising McIlveen two relatives contacted police. McIlveen was arrested and claimed that whilst his memory of the attacks was not clear, he told police he had been on a date with a female on the day of October .  He said that after the woman got up and left him sitting on his own in a bar he felt humiliated - and this led to a decision to go and hurt woman as he felt females were responsible for everything that had gone wrong in his le. McIlveen admitted he wanted to slash one of the women in the face, and said he attacked another woman as she made him particularly angry after stepping onto the road as he cycled past. Judge Kinney said: It is an utterly repugnant idea that this perceived rejection could in some way justy his actions in attacking vulnerable females in public places.The defendant engaged in a determined and pre-meditated campaign to cause harm to innocent and vulnerable female victims. He deliberately chose to target young women and his violence had only one objective, and that was to hurt women.The judge said that after reading victim impact statements, the common theme is the distress by those McIlveen subjected to such random and serious violence.Defence barrister Patrick Lyttle QC said it was quite clear his client will need assistance whilst in prison for a range of psychological issues. Judge Kinney said that while he accepted there were medical issues, he agreed with a probation board assessment that McIlveen posed a serious risk of harm to the public and was a dangerous offender. Due to this assessment, Judge Kinney imposed an extended custodial sentence consisting of nine years custody followed by an extended licence period of three years in a bid to protect the public. The sentence means McIlveen may not be automatically released on licence after serving half his prison term. His release will be determined by parole commissioners, and when this occurs he will be on licence for a further three years.

Minutes earlier, Christopher Walters had been spotted running in Longton where an Audi A’s windows had been smashed with a -pound sledgehammer. Garage boss Jonathan Hassall and mechanic Benjamin Hunt gave chase, following him down a path near Gladstone Primary Academy.An inquest heard today how they tried to restrain him. But what began as a citizens’ arrest turned into tragedy, reports StokeonTrent Live. Mr Walters was lying on the grass verge as Mr Hunt had him in a neck hold. The incident lasted for some minutes and he went into cardiac arrest.He was later pronounced dead at Royal Stoke University Hospital.Following his death, the Independent Office for Police Conductlooked into the time between the first police officer arriving on scene and CPR being started on Mr Walters.  It was established this gap had been one minute and  seconds – a time described by North Staffordshire assistant coroner Sarah Murphy as ‘reasonable’ considering police didn’t have the full facts when they arrived. The events unfolded shortly after lunchtime on May , . The Audi A belonged to the garage and was parked outside when the alarm went off. It was found with several windows smashed. A PE lesson was taking place in the nearby school grounds when Mr Walters was seen running down the path, out of breath and apparently ‘hugging’ the sledgehammer, with the others in pursuit. One witness, Ricky Amos, was driving past when he spotted Mr Walters lying down on the ground. “The others were on top of him,” he recalled in a statement. Mr Hunt had his arms around Mr Walters’ neck. “He had a tight grip of the man’s neck. The man was struggling to worm himself out.” Mr Amos said he saw one of the males holding the sledgehammer in the air before hitting Mr Walters’ legs with it. Another passing driver, Michelle Leese, said in a statement: “I remember just seeing arms everywhere.” She also recalled seeing one of the men pick up the sledgehammer. At that point, she told her daughter, who was also in the car, to call the police. But the use of the hammer was later disputed by Mr Hunt. The -year-old, from Longton, is currently serving a -month sentence in prison after pleading guilty to manslaughter last year.  In his basis of plea, he said he deployed a headlock, but claimed neither he nor Mr Hassall had used weapons. Mr Hassall, , sadly took his own le days before he was due to stand trial. Forensic pathologist Dr Alexander Kolar, who carried out the post-mortem, noted injuries to the legs, but no evidence of blunt force trauma. He put the cause of death down to compression of the neck. Tests also showed Mr Walters, of Winchester Avenue, Bentilee, had used cannabis at some point before his death. The initial call to the police related to the vehicle damage. It was only while en route from Stone that an officer got an update about the suspect being restrained by members of the public. Sergeant Anthony McKenzie decided to go and assist in a police riot van. It turned out he was the first officer on scene. He saw Mr Walters being held by Mr Hunt, but said the ‘grip did not appear to be firm’. He told him to release the man. Sgt McKenzie began checking Mr Walters for a pulse. It was at this point that PCSO Toni Foyle was driving past and stopped to help. She said: “Sgt McKenzie shouted to the male, ‘Are you alright, mate’. As he did this, the male’s face moved slightly. I saw his lips were blue and he had grass in his mouth. “I knelt down, putting him in the recovery position. I said, ‘This man needs an ambulance urgently’. I started chest compressions.” Addressing the inquest, Nicola Brooks, the solicitor for Mr Walters’ mother, said there was no evidence he’d shown any aggression towards the men. She added: “He was simply running away. As it turned out, he was running for his le and was cornered in an area of Wood Street, where he was set upon for some  to  minutes.” Concluding the death was due to unlawful killing, Ms Murphy said, on the balance of probabilities, Mr Walters had caused the vehicle damage. But she added: “He didn’t deserve to lose his le.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON University HospitalHospitals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The mould has been treated numerous times but it’s continuously growing back. They sent in one guy to paint the wall, but that didn’t do anything to help.  Hackney Council responded saying since the last treatment of mould, theyaposve received no further reports.“It’s terrible - I used to be a photographer, and I was outgoing and I could approach people and ask to take photos of them. Now, I don’t talk to people, Nic continued. I don’t go out. And because of the banging and hammeringand smashing about, I don’t sleep.” Nic said there is a rats’ nest next to his property, and that the light fittings in his flatare filled with insects.At the same time he claims to have received persistent threats and abuse from his neighbours, and that some of them often play music at full volume throughout the night. He also says his neighbours have at times urinated outside his front door. Nic’s best friend and carer Tora Peacock, , has been helping him in his fight to be moved somewhere more suitable. and because of Nic’s mental health considerations, she has been contacting Hackney Council to have her friend moved, but to no avail.  “The property isn’t suitable for Nic. Ideally we just want him moved somewhere more suitable for his back and knee issues. Getting him moved is the main priority, but for the most partis not even answering the phone anymore, alleged Tora.She claims that, when trying to reach out to Hackney Council, the response has often been hostile saying she has even been “screamed at” by staff at the councilover the phone on a number of occasions - and has been told “not to complain”.Together, Tora and Nic said they have made over  complaints about his living situation, though Tora has sent over  emails herself asking the council to act. Nic said he has requested to move homes around  times - he claims he was promised to be moved in , then again in , but is still stuck in the same place. Hackney Council’s Strategic Housing Director, Steve Waddington, told MyLondon: “This is an extremely complex situation which we have been working closely for a number of years with [Nic] and his advocate Ms Peacock to resolve. We recognise that there are some aspects of [Nicaposs] complaint that we could have handled better, and we have and are continuing to take steps to remedy this. “Following reports of mould, we carried out a survey of [Nicaposs] home last year and found the issue was being exacerbated by lack of ventilation in the property. We took steps to treat the issue - including installing new fans in the kitchen and bathroom - and have had no further reports of mould since then. We are investigatingany other longer term steps are needed to tackle the issue and have also provided some advice to [Nic] on ways he can also help prevent it occurring. “We have investigated reports made by [Nic] of noise nuisance, including visiting the property and providing noise monitors on several occasions, but so far have been unable to substantiate any evidence of this. However, we will continue to work with [Nic] about his concerns. We have and will continue to work with him around all housing options open to him.” The Mirror has contacted Hackney Council for comment.

Image: Daily MirrorByFrailly Sodapo:,  Apr |commentsMud from the Marble Arch mound will be used to rebuild Hadrianaposs Wall as part of Tory aposlevelling upapos plans, it can be exclusively revealed by the Mirror.Tourism experts say the Twitter storm that greeted the west London rubbish heap will soon be replicated up north.As we all know, Twitter mentions equals eyeballs and by that metric the Marble Arch mound has been a huge success, one said. Londoners were distraught when the £m mound started to be demolished earlier this year after it was such a storming success. Thousands visited the grassy knoll and were amazed by the views it offered of several nearby Pret a Manger. Tory MP and London tourism minister Mike Wrap said: I know Londoners will be bitterly disappointed to be losing this iconic temporary structure that has been compared to the Efel Tower.  Sadly, unlike the inferior Efel, this one has to come down and the opportunity to rebuild Hadrianaposs Wall and level up the north could not be missed. The mound is simply too good for London to hog it to itself. Hadrianaposs Wall has been incomplete for too long and, frankly, is an eyesore whereas the mound has lit up the London skies. The ambitious project is estimated to cost £bn and take three months but will actually cost £bn and probably never be finished. Mr Wrap said Northerners would be thrilled with the scheme and denied suggestions that it was an attempt to placate red wall voters with aposLondon castoffsapos.  Theyaposre always talking about how expensive it is down here, well this is free of charge! Itaposs time to spread the wealth and culture of London and how better to do this than by aposspreadingapos the mound up north. Tourism chiefs said the fact that Hadrianaposs Wall was a UNESCO World Heritage Site was not important with one quipping to the Mirror: Canapost canapost we just have a referendum on UNE-xit apos.  London resident Victoria Applecross said: Seeing the mound go was a bitter blow but Iaposll sleep easier knowing itaposs going to a good home and a good use. Maybe they should rename the wall  Hadrian died ages ago anyway and no one knows who he is these days.

Jane was given a new heart in October  after  months on the transplant waiting listNatalie Bailey with her daughter Maggie and mum Jane Image: Daily Mirror Andy StenningByWarren MangerFeatures Writer:,  Mar |comments Little Maggie Lawry spent her first birthday surrounded by wrapping paper and presents... but the best gt of all was the presence of her mum and grandma. Mother and daughter Jane and Natalie Bailey had both suffered from failing hearts and each had received le-saving transplants within weeks of Maggie’s birth from strangers she will never meet.Their case is so remarkable that surgeons at the country’s largest transplant centre, in Birmingham, have never seen anything like it before. Natalie, , says: “We are so lucky to have both been given a second chance. Le could have been so dferent for Maggieit wasn’t for our donors. “Andit wasn’t for Maggie, I could have just dropped dead one day from heart failure.”  Jane was given a new heart in October  after  months on the transplant waiting list. But the relief was short-lived as a few weeks later, Natalie discovered her heart was failing too. Worse still, Natalie was  weeks pregnant and the shock sent her into premature labour. She was rushed into surgery and Maggie was delivered by emergency Caesarean as doctors feared that neither would survive a natural birth. Natalie then needed a mechanical pump to send blood circulating around her body until a new heart could be found, as her own could no longer keep her alive. She was so ill she had a stroke and was put at the top of the “supra-urgent” list, so every donor heart was immediately checked to seeit was her match. Jane, , says: “I was still in hospital recovering when I found out Natalie needed a transplant too and the nurses took me to intensive care to see her. “It was the first time I’d seen her for weeks, because coronavirus meant she couldn’t visit me.“It was scary seeing her on the heart pump, knowing that was the only thing keeping her alive. I blamed myself, because we had the same heart condition. It must be genetic. “The only comfort was knowing I could answer any questions she had and support her, as I’d just been through the same thing. I knew the doctors were amazing and she was strong, so I clung to the hope she would recover and be the same person as before.” Natalie and Jane both suffered from a rare condition, dilated cardiomyopathy, which makes the walls of the main heart chamber too thin to pump blood. Jane developed breathing dficulties in mid- and scans showed her heart failing. She was fitted with a pacemaker that September and a donor heart was found just over a year later. She spent her th birthday in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham after a transplant. When Natalie began suffering similar breathing dficulties, it was initially put down to low iron during her pregnancy. But when she was admitted to the same hospital with chest pains and her baby stopped moving, doctors found she too was suffering heart failure.Mum-of-four Natalie, from Birmingham, says: “It was terrying, all this came out of nowhere. They were giving me oxygen and I still couldn’t breathe. “The doctor looked at me and said, ‘I think we need to get that baby out of you’. Then the contractions started and they took me straight to theatre becauseI’d given birth naturally, neither of us would have made it.” Natalie didn’t even get to hold Maggie before the baby was whisked away to the neonatal unit, where she spent the next two weeks with her dad Carl camped beside her cot. Natalie’s condition got worse and two days later she was fitted with a mechanical heart. She says: “I was so ill some days I’d wake up and forget I’d had a baby.” Within a week a donor heart was found and Natalie had transplant surgery lasting more than  hours, but on the way back to the ward, she had a stroke.  When she woke, she could not speak or use her left arm or leg. But two days later, Natalie was able to see Maggie and hold her for the first time. She says: “Carl laid her in my lap and I was able to hold her bottle in my right hand to feed her. The emotion was overwhelming. “The nurses said that they saw my recovery speed up after that, because I had a reason to get better.” Natalie spent eight weeks in hospital before ing home on December . Jane says: “When she came home, I hugged her and didn’t want to let go. It felt amazing. We’d both made it through something terrible, but we were home in time to spend Christmas together.” Jane says: “I’m so grateful to my donor, their family, and to Natalie’s. My grandchildren got to keep their mum and their grandmother thanks to the courage and kindness of complete strangers.” Natalie and Jane have been recovering well after their transplants at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, and will be forever grateful to the transplant team. Jorge Mascaro, director of heart and lung transplants, says: “There was a lot of emotional pressure for the team. They had never treated two members of the same family at the same time before.” The hospital is trying to raise £million to create a national centre of excellence and increase transplants by %. As Natalie helped Maggie blow out the candles on her birthday cake, she made a special wish. She says: “I hope one day I can thank my donor’s family and that seeing what a happy, loving family we are gives them some comfort.”See organdonation.nhs.uk and support the fundraising for the new Birmingham Transplant Centre at hospitalcharity.org birminghamtransplantcentreRead MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BabiesHospitalsPregnancyGiving birthHeart diseaseImmune systemOrgan donationHeart transplantsCoronavirusDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Smile and wave, he says, standing symbolically high on his moving pedestal, the corners of his mouth slowly slipping. Why isnapost everybody cheering for the white man  Will thinks.Yes, the monarchy benefitted from slavery. Yes, protestors are calling for reparations. Yes, Iaposm completely out of touch but I got up on stage and declared slavery should NEVER have happened. What more can I do  I wonderthis was a mistake  Kate whispers - the first thought sheaposd formed on her own in a while - as she shakes the hand of a Black child through the prison- I mean gates. Safe to say, the standing symbolically high on his moving pedestal deserved the backlash it created. But from it, talk about the royalsapos hard work ethic and dedication to duty also arose. Itaposs the perfect smokescreen to move on from the controversy something the royals have had plenty of practice with. But in doing so, they stick their fingers up at the public once again, and dig themselves an even bigger hole. Will certainly takes after Daddy, Prince Charles, who is impatiently twiddling his thumbs for his five minutes of being King.  The Prince of Wales was crowned the hardest working Royal back in  - after completing  engagements. Republic states this is the equivalent of aposworkingapos  and a half days - a measly fraction of the average full-time worker, who puts in more than  days a year. And that would be fineCharles was on a pro-rata salary and just looking for a little bit of cash to fund his gardening projects. But no, the Royal has a personal income of more than £ million - meaning he gets to shake peopleaposs hands and poses for photos for an eye-watering £, an hour. We need to get rid of the idea that any of the royals are hard-working. Itaposs an insult to teachers, to NHS workers, to those scraping by on minimum wage while the monarchyaposs only job is to protect itself.

It has now been reported that, despite marrying and Claire taking her husbandaposs name, the couple are now living separately from each other in dferent homes in Glasgow, although it is understood they still see each other, according to Mail Online. The disastrous end to their wedding three years ago happened after hours of heavy drinking, leading to a fight breaking out, the Mirror reported yesterday.Claire, a mother to four children, grabbed her own mum, Cherry-Ann Lindsay, , by the hair before hitting her with a stiletto. She also put her hands around her mumaposs throat.  Ms Lindsay told the Mail: She then grabbed me and put me in a choke hold. I couldn’t breathe. I thought I was going to die. Neighbours told how the married couple are living apart in the Scottish city. A neighbour said: They don’t live together no. They’re at separate addresses a few miles apart and have been for a while. But they do still visit each other so it’s not clear what the state of the relationship is. Claire attacked her mum and her mumaposs partner -year-old David Boyd, at which time Eamonn, a former professional boxer, and his brother Kieran joined in. David was punched, kicked, bitten and grabbed at the neck by the two brothers. They also pushed their thumbs into his eyes.  Kieran Goodbrand also punched and kicked Garry Brown, another guest at the wedding. Wedding day photos show the newly married couple beaming with happiness on the dance floor and standing for photos by water. Police were called to wedding venue The Vu at Ballencrieff Toll, Bathgate, in West Lothian after the fight, which spilled onto the lawn, was reportedly caught on CCTV. The bride, groom and best man were all arrested and held in custody that night. The couple plus their best man, who are all from Uddingston in Lanarkshire, pleaded guilty to assault and injury charges at Livingston Sherf Court this week. Claire Goodbrand pleaded guilty on indictment to assault to injury but not guilty to a more serious assault to severe injury.  She admitted repeatedly seizing her mother by the hair, punching and kicking her on the head and body, causing her to fall to the ground, before striking her head at The Vue wedding venue at Ballencrieff Toll in West Lothian’s Bathgate Hills. She also admitted punching and kicking her mum Cherry-Ann to the head and body whilst she was on the ground, striking her on the head with a shoe and seizing her by the neck and restricting her breathing. Eamonn and Kieran both pled guilty to repeatedly punching and kicking David Boyd on the head and body while acting together. The charge states that they caused him to fall to the ground and continued their violent attack as he lay there. They admitted pushing their thumbs into Mr Boyd’s eyes, biting him on the head and body and repeatedly seizing him by the neck and restricting his breathing, all to his severe injury.In addition, Kieran Goodbrand admitted assaulting Garry Brown by punching and kicking him on the head and body to his injury at the reception on  June . A fourth member of the family, -year-old Brendan Goodbrand, had his not guilty pleas to two assault charges accepted by the Crown after his alibi that he had left the venue before trouble broke out turned out to be true. Sherf Martin Edington called for criminal justice social work reports on all three accused before passing sentence. He adjourned the case until  April for information on possible disposals, including social work supervision, unpaid hours of work and restriction of liberty by electronic curfew.Eamonn Goodbrand’s Facebook page reveals that he works as a professional fighter, boxing competitively as a light middleweight.It was reported after the wedding reception that one of the alleged victims lost part of a finger during the attack. The prosecution will narrate the full circumstances when the case calls for sentence. Ms Lindsay said, to her, the wedding day felt like a sick joke. She said her daughter was swearing like a banshee and the boys were drinking beer and falling over each other. She said she began to sense trouble brewing but didnapost expect it to escalate so much. The -year-old said she has moved away to an undisclosed address and does not want to see them anymore.

Ian Longley had travelled from the sunshine hotspot of Verona, Italy but was hit by horrendous queues when he landed back at Manchester Airportapossapos terminal two. He claims he was was trapped there for almost four hours Staff shortages and queues were the main reason for his delays after landing with on March  at .pm. But because of a litany of snags and glitches with aircraft handling, immigration and baggage Ian claims it wasn’t until after pm he finally left the airport Ian, , says he understands the unprecedented pressure that Manchester Airport is facing due to a range of issues, including staff shortages, sparked by the pandemic. But his biggest complaint is the way in which management dealt with his grumbles. He told Manchester Evening News: “I understand there are practical problems with things like Covid and recruitment but there were no staff. Not another single person in the building you could speak to.“The one engineer we saw eventually swore at an elderly lady. “It’s like passengers are an inconvenience, we are treated with contempt. There’s a lack of information, a lack of people to speak to. We are treated like cattle. I’ve had enough of it. “What I’m trying to communicate with the airport is that it’s not just about the queue, or that we were delayed. That’s bad enough. It’s about how they treat people.” Manchester Airport, meanwhile, say the issues in question are managed by the Home Office and a handling agent, while they have endeavoured to deal with Ianaposs complaint in good time.  After arrival at the terminal, they were stuck on the aircraft for aposalmost an hourapos while staff waited for ‘chocks’ to secure the wheels. Manchester Airport has said the airline’s handling agent Swissport would be responsible for this. Once off the plane, another delay ensued at Immigration, which is run by the Home Office, where, Ian claims, ‘two thirds of the automated gates were not working’. Immigration completed, Ian had high hopes for a smooth run to the door - but then came the baggage hall, a process which, again, is run by the airline’s handling agent Swissport. Ian said: “At pm not a single bag had been delivered, a Tannoy announcement told us that, due to a shortage of staff, they had been unable to unload the aircraft. There were no further announcements and not a single member of staff in the building. He claimed a man in overalls and a high-viz jacket eventually appeared and seemed to examine the conveyor. But Swissport have denied this staff member works for them. It is unclear who they report to. He added: An elderly lady asked him when the baggage would appear. His response sums up the whole problem with Manchester airport. Succinctly, ‘Its got f*** all to do with me’.” Ian says his bag finally came into view at .pm - more than three hours after arrival. His flight from Italy took one hour and  minutes. It took three hours and  minutes to reclaim his baggage, he claims.

He says he understands the pressure Manchester Airport is under, but added: “I am angry about the airport’s response to my enquiries.” “At pm not a single bag had been delivered, a Tannoy announcement told us that, due to a shortage of staff, they had been unable to unload the aircraft. There were no further announcements and not a single member of staff in the building.  Customer Services only led to an an automated voice, while the head office number was met with ‘this person’s phone is switched off’. He finally reached the press office and arranged a call back from a customer service supervisor who, Ian claims, ‘refused to give their name’ and issued an ‘insincere apology’, while explaining that the airport was ‘not responsible for the problems he had experienced’. Ian was promised a call from a senior manager, which he says never happened, and has since sent emails to ious staff members, including MD Karen Smart, to no avail. “This is my real complaint and it is symptomatic of the problems at Manchester Airport, they treat their customers with complete contempt. A Manchester Airport spokesman said: “We are disappointed to hear Mr Langley was unhappy with his experience when ing through the airport. We are aware of challenges faced by our partners on the day in question, which led to service standards falling below what we want to see at Manchester Airport. This includes ground handling agents handling bags on behalf of airlines, and UK Border Force managing the immigration process. The whole of the industry is facing challenges associated with recovering from the biggest crisis it has faced in a generation, and while we understand the pressure this places on all partners operating at Manchester Airport, we will work with those concerned to understand the root cause of issues. “Mr Langley raised his concerns with us on Monday morning and received a call from a complaints manager on the same day. We are aware he was unhappy with some elements of this response, and he has since had a second phone call from a senior team member to explore his concerns in greater detail. “We take all feedback about our processes and service seriously, and have offered to have further discussions with him and members of his partyappropriate. At the same, we want to be clear that rude, abusive or offensive behaviour towards any of our colleagues will not be tolerated.” “We would like apologise to the passengers who experienced delays disembarking and collecting baggage at Manchester Airport. We understand the frustration of passengers who have experienced this disruption and we are working hard with our partners to implement contingency measures to remedy these delays.” As international travel continues to reopen and passenger numbers rise, we have been clear that queue times may be longer as we ensure all passengers are compliant with the security and immigration measures put in place to keep us safe. Border Force’s number one priority is to maintain a secure border, and we will not compromise on this. We are working closely with all UK ports to ensure passengers have the smoothest possible journey, and we will continue to deploy our staff as flexibly as we can.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Manchester Airport\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Free testing for the general public ends on Friday as part of the Living with Covid plan which last month set out the government’s strategy to live with and manage the virus.From  April, updated guidance will advise people with symptoms of a respiratory infection, including Covid-, and a high temperature or who feel unwell, to try stay at home and avoid contact with other people, until they feel well enough to resume normal activities and they no longer have a high temperature, the Department of Health and Social Care says.Until this date, people should continue to follow the current guidance. Children and young people who are unwell and have a high temperature should also stay at home and avoid contact with other people, where they can. They can go back to school, college or childcare when they no longer have a high temperature, and they are well enough to attend.  From April , anyone with a positive Covid- test result will be advised to try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for  days, which is when they are most infectious. Advice will be provided for iniduals who need to leave their home when they have symptoms or have tested positive, including avoiding close contact with people with a weakened immune system, wearing a face-covering and avoiding crowded places. Dame Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said: As we learn to live with Covid, we are focusing our testing provision on those at higher risk of serious outcomes from the virus, while encouraging people to keep following simple steps to help keep themselves and others safe. The pandemic is not over and how the virus will develop over time remains uncertain. Covid still poses a real risk to many of us, particularly with case rates and hospitalisations on the rise. That is why it is sensible to wear a mask in enclosed spaces, keep indoor spaces ventilated and stay away from othersyou have any symptoms of a respiratory illness, including Covid.  Vaccination remains the best way to protect us all from severe disease and hospitalisation due to Covid infection. If you have not yet come forward for your primary or booster I would urge you to do so straight away – the NHS vaccine programme is there to help you and the sooner you are vaccinated the sooner you and your family and friends will be protected.Under the plans set out free symptomatic testing will be provided for: Patients in hospital, where a PCR test is required for their care and to provide access to treatments and to support ongoing clinical surveillance for new iants People who are eligible for community Covid- treatments because they are at higher risk of getting seriously ill from Covid-. People in this group will be contacted directly and sent lateral flow tests to keep at home for usethey have symptoms as well as being told how to reorder tests People living or working in some high-risk settings. For example, staff in adult social care services such as homecare organisations and care homes, and residents in care homes and extra care and supported living services, NHS workers and those working and living in hospices, and prisons and places of detention , where infection needs to be identied quickly to minimise outbreaks. People will also be tested before being discharged from hospital into care homes, hospices, homelessness settings and domestic abuse refuges. Asymptomatic lateral flow testing will continue from April in some high-risk settings where infection can spread rapidly while prevalence is high. This includes patient-facing staff in the NHS and NHS-commissioned Independent Healthcare Providers, staff in hospices and adult social care services, such as homecare organisations and care homes, a small number of care home visitors who provide personal care, staff in some prisons and places of detention and in high risk domestic abuse refuges and homelessness settings.Testing will be provided for residential SEND, care home staff and residents during an outbreak and for care home residents upon admission. This also includes some staff in prisons and immigration removal centres.

Their final royal outing together was at the  Commonwealth Day service on March , , where they joined the Queen and other members of the Royal Family. And according to Hello! royal correspondent Danielle Stacey, there was a reason why their working royal status did not end until three weeks after their final engagement - and itaposs down to the end of the financial year. The publication reports that the Royal Household marks the end of its financial year on March  - and as Harry and Meghan had said they wanted to be financially independent, thataposs why the date was chosen.Since leaving the UK to carve out a new le for themselves and their children Archie and Lilibet in Calornia, Harry has only ed to the UK twice. Meghan has not ed and neither has Archie. Lilibet was born in the US and has not yet been to Britain.

It came amid a row over their security in the UK, as Harry has said it isnapost safe for him to bring his family here.  And royal expert Ingrid Seward, author of Prince Philip Revealed, tells The Mirror she believes their silence speaks volumes. She said: The wall of silence was as loud asthey had shouted from the abbey rafters. The normally verbose Duke and Duchess of Sussex said nothing. No spokesperson spewed out long sentences of undecipherable wordage. There were no flowers with the florists name proudly displayed. No comments from Archwell. Nothing. Not even a word from their supporters on ious social media accounts.

Buckingham Palace will calculate an elderly monarchaposs above criticism on the day of her dear, dead husbandaposs memorial service. But choosing to be escorted to and from Westminster Abbey by a man who paid a reported £-million to settle a sordid sex case to avoid court was deeply distasteful. It wasnapost a sweet old maaposam who wanted to travel from Windsor Castle in state limousine with a scoundrel shunned since paying off a woman who alleged when a teenager she was force to sleep with a dad of two old enough to be her own father.  This was an elderly monarch exploiting sympathy at a personal yet very public event to walk back into polite society a reviled man forced to give up even honorary membership of a posh golf club over the scandals spewing from a close friendship with a convicted paedophile and his jailed fixer. What Virginia Giuffre makes of it one can only imagine but much of the watching world, particularly women victims of abuse, will have been revolted. The removal of his military titles and royal patronages, including the use of a His Royal Highness title, look a ersion.  The Duke of York, her favourite son, remains promoted despite stomach-churning behaviour that shouldaposve seen tainted Andrew seated out of sight at the back behind a pillar. Perhaps age and frailty are distorting her judgement because this was a colossal mistake by a declining monarch. She put her son and family before decency, trying to sell a leper to the country at a service commemorating her husband. Knee-bending courtiers will struggle from now on to argue sheaposs principled and does what is right in the service of the country.  She held on to Andrewaposs arm but it was her parading him. He continues to deny the claim but embracing the humiliated sex case settler damaged her own reputation.

Kelly Legg, from RSPCA Birmingham where Eric has been living, said: “Eric has spent almost his entire le in our care and all he knows is le here with us. He was part of an investigation and case, but was eventually signed over for rehoming in January . to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. “Because he’s been with us for so long, he has missed out on a lot of ‘real le’ and because of that we’ve really struggled to find the right match for him. He needs a very specic home with owners who are experienced with his breed type and the sort of lestyle he needs, and can also help him really carefully and slowly navigate the world. “He really is the most loving, affectionate and loyal lad once he gets to know you. He’s extremely clever and needs to have his brain challenged, but he needs time to adjust to new people and build up a bond with them too.”His adopters will need to make the time to make multiple visits and build a bond with him slowly. In unpredictable situations, such as moving vehicles, unfamiliar people or noisy machinery, he can react intensely and become very anxious. “Everything about le in a new home will be new and overwhelming to Eric and we really need to find people who understand this and can hold his paw and guide him very slowly and positively through all of these new and scary experiences,” Kelly said. He’s looking for an adult-only home without any other pets, with someone who will be around most of the time.He can be unsure around other dogs so ideally he needs to go to a quiet, rural home where his owners have private land that Eric can enjoy and explore.The RSPCA would love for him to have his own room somewhere quiet where he can go to rest and relax. Eric is muzzle trained and his new adopters have been advised to keep him muzzled when walking him in public or introducing him to new people.

Maya Gibbon, who was a science teacher, has been left mostly unable to get out of bed after catching the virusMaya Gibbon has been struggling to adjust to le with a chronic health conditionByRos Wynne JonesReal Britain columnistClaire Donnelly:,  Mar |comments Maya Gibbon was a busy science teacher at a Brighton secondary school two years ago. Since ­contracting Covid in the classroom, she has been mostly unable to get out of bed, struggling to adjust to le with a chronic health condition.Unable to work, and with her husband now acting as her full-time carer, the couple were forced to live in a van for five months last year and are now facing homelessness again. “This week is my two-year Covid ­anniversary and I honestly feel like the person I was died two years ago,” Maya says. “I have stopped doing practically everything I did before.”Antony Loveless and his partner Claire caught the virus in January  and have never recovered. At times, it has affected the couple so badly that Antony has even contemplated taking his own le. “We had professional lives, we worked - hours a day, then came home, cooked dinner, did chores, we volunteered,” he says. “Now I struggle to make toast. Our le is in these four walls. We can’t even use our car because we can’t walk the few feet to get to it.” Saskia Mulder, , a deputy ward sister, living in Derry, Northern Ireland, caught Covid after caring for positive patients in March . She also says she has felt suicidal at times. “I thought I’d be better after a few weeks,” she says. “Two years on I’m still off work, using a stick and have cognitive problems. I’m nowhere near the person I was, my mental health has suffered so much. I’m a strong person, but it’s taken everything.” We are now told we must “live with” Covid. Yet for . million people with Long Covid, le over the last two years has changed unrecognisably – with very little support. Many of these people were key workers who had to work while the rest of Britain kept safe. Many in the public sector were betrayed by the Government’s failure on PPE. Yet, like the Covid bereaved, these people are now in danger of being forgotten by a government in whose interests it is to move on as quickly as possible from the virus.Today, in a moving debate called in Parliament, Layla Moran MP, Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, told those with Long Covid: “We hear you. You have not been forgotten. And we continue to fight for you.” As well as a public health emergency, Moran warned of a “looming crisis ahead” for the economy with .% of the population affected. “Public sector workers gave their lives,” she said. “When we were all allowed to be at home, they went in, and, according to the Office for National Statistics, are the ones who have the highest prevalence of Long Covid. I do believe we owe them so much more.”Labour MP Debbie Abrahams spoke about her own experience of Long Covid, including “prolonged fatigue and nasty bouts of nausea,” as well as “worsened arthritis, pain that is sometimes completely debilitating”.She raised the plight of , children with Long Covid as well as that of frontline workers and people in deprived communities more associated with the condition. “This Covid pandemic is far from over,” she told the House.The APPG reports that the UK government has “continuously failed” to take Long Covid into account and has not “adequately funded” research into treatment. Antony Loveless goes further. “They have blood on their hands,” he says. “They are wilfully ignoring it. I had to sit and listen to Rishi Sunak talking about writing off £.billion of fraudulent business loans when there’s only £million put forward to Long Covid support. It’s loose change to them, isn’t it ”While Downing Street partied, Maya Gibbon has been living a new le of chronic illness and hospital appointments. She has had four hospital admissions, two operations, more than  blood tests, eight MRIs,  CT scans, two lumbar punctures,  ultrasounds, one colonoscopy, and multiple ECGs. She’s had thunderclap headaches that make her black out, and kidney stones caused by her medication. She can count the number of walks she has taken on the fingers of her hands.“I miss work so much,” she says. “And I am absolutely filled with dread about all the cost of living increases coming.” Saskia Mulder says her experience has opened her eyes “to the way people with health conditions are treated. I always saw it as the nurse, now it’s as a patient. At one point I was suicidal… I do want to go back to work becauseyou don’t have hope, what have you got  But a lot of nurses are being told to retire on grounds of ill health.”Antony’s partner Claire, , is too exhausted to speak to us. She is about to have her contract with the NHS terminated, after being off sick for the last  months.Antony, , an author and a former investigator at the London Gateway Port lost his own job last year. “We had savings, but they went,” he says. “Now we’re surviving on benefits. I’ve lost four stone and Claire has lost six-and-a-half stone. We’re disabled now and it’s been a struggle to accept that.” Last year, Antony planned to take his own le. “I hit rock bottom last summer,” he says. “I said to Claire, ‘I’ve got nothing left. I want to end my le’.” He says support from community groups and counselling saved him. Maya looks back over the last two years. “I wish I would have known that it would have been so isive,” she says. “That people would have denied it existed, denied it was bad and laughed at the thing that had changed your le. “I wish that I would have known that the country would have listened to politicians as opposed to scientists and doctors of infectious diseases.” Saskia Mulder has a question for the Government. “They clapped for us when we were on the front line, but now what ” she asks.

He successfully mated with -year-old female Charlie last November and the eggs she laid have now resulted in the arrival of two tiny tortoises at Crocodiles of the World in Brize Norton, Oxon.It is the first time a British zoo has successfully bred a Giant Galapagos tortoise that is an endangered species.And despite their tiny size - they are about the size of a tennis ball and weigh about ozs each - they will grow to  stones each as adults. Giant Galapagos tortoises are famous for their long necks and are synonymous with Charles Darwin who discovered the theory of evolution by studying them.  The arrival of two baby tortoises is good news for the species whose numbers in the world now stand at about , compared to , in the th century. They are classed as vulnerable on the IUCNaposs Red List. Keepers at Crocodiles of the World are closely monitoring their progress and feeding them a diet of dried grasses, leafy greens, pear cactus and weeds. Shaun Foggett, founder of Crocodiles of the World, said: Weaposre incredibly proud to have successfully bred these tortoises, who have previously been very close to extinction. We have all been hoping for this day since the giant tortoises joined us in  and itaposs a signicant achievement towards helping the conservation of the species. The attraction has four adult Giant Galapagos tortoises three females called Zuzu, Isabella and Charlie and Dirk, who is named after lothario Dirk Diggler from the movie Boogie Nights. They are part of a European conservation programme. Dirk originally came to Britain after being caught from the wild on the Galapagos Islands in . Giant Galapagos tortoises - Chelonoidis niger in Latin - are the largest tortoise species in the world they can grow up to ft inand lbs in weight. They mate all year round and the male is known to make loud grunting noises when doing so.

Parts of the country woke up to snow on Thursday, with cautious forecasts of a small amount of flakes surpassed for those in the east of the country where several inches had settled. The frosty turn, which is being powered by a blast of air from the Arctic, comes a week after the start of Spring and a run of unusually warm temperatures, blue sky and sunshine. While temperatures may not quite be getting back to the C that graced parts of the UK just days ago, forecasters say temperatures will be back in the double digits soon enough.Speaking to The Mirror, Met Office Meteorologist Annie Shuttleworth said the warm temperatures over recent days were something of a “ start” to the new season. “The temperatures we saw last week were well above the average temperature for late March across the UK,” she said. “So it may have felt like summer for some but in fact it is still early spring when the average temperature is around  or  C in the UK.” Cold arctic air has brought colder temperatures, which would stick around over the weekend, Ms Shuttleworth said. Temperatures overnight on Thursday were due to settle just a few degrees above zero for most areas, with Cpredicted for London and Edinburgh. Devon and Cornwall are set to see the warmest temperature of C, with the coolest of C forecast for Aberdeenshire and North Yorkshire. This follows last weekaposs sunshine when the mercury hit C in some places. Weekend temperatures are predicted to remain in the single figures too. The mercury is forecast to reach highs of C and C across the UK on Friday and Saturday, increasing to C and C on Sunday. Sunny spells with some cloud are predicted for the rest of England, Scotland and Wales, with a largely cloudy day all round on Sunday.  Meteorologist Matty Box said there is a cold air mass over the UK. There is an ice warning out at the moment, he said. If thereaposs any melting and refreezing overnight then thereaposs an ice risk. I suspect there will be a similar risk for Thursday night to Friday morning.Discussing Fridayaposs weather, he added: It will be concentrated and there will be snow showers.It will be eastern and northern areas of the UK that are more likely to see any showers of rain, sleet or snow.  The weather will then improve over the weekend, with some sunny spells. Showers will become less frequent, but still with the chance of some wintry showers in the east coast and the North Sea coast in particular through Saturday, Mr Box said. There should be a fair amount of sunshine as well. In Canterbury, Kent, snow saw a county cricket warm-up match between Lancashire and Kent suspended and then cancelled on Thursday. A wind change to more of a westerly direction next week would bring temperatures back to double figures for many - though many would see a healthy dousing of rain as well. And Ms Shuttleworth said it looks as though we will see temperatures at or above average throughout the month of April. However, Spring was often a changeable month temperature wise, Ms Shuttleworth noted, “as our seas are still cold after the winter but the sun is getting stronger and the days longer”. “The temperatures can y a lot depending on the wind direction,” she said.

Michael Langford, , couldnapost believe what he was seeing when he pulled out a mammoth version of the cheese and onion crisp that was almost as long as the packet.

One poster GelapopShipper_ captioned the screenshot with: What the heck is this The Daily Star reports the sight left many Reddit users questioning what the image contained.Someone swatted a really big fly, one Reddit user jested. Another offered a further explanation: A place to sacrice pigs the traditional way .  A third said: Bloody puddle  But some people suggested the reality was much less interesting and reckoned the white structures were simply farm storage areas on the farm. Looks like  silos. The reddish colour is the sediment, possibly a high traffic area, said one person. The user suggested parts of Australia had red earth which the would explain the image. While someone  reckoned it was a place where animals went to eat and drink and it results in them churning up the ground which could be more visible by images from space.Elsewhere on Google Maps, a little boy was spotted holding a pistol which prompted a mixed reaction from some fans on Reddit. The image, posted to the subreddit r googlemapsshenanigans shows a young child in a pair of shorts with no shirt or shoes, captioned with the words You came to the wrong neighbourhood... The weapon was being held by his left hand by his side, but his face was blurred out as is usually done on the app. The picture which was discovered on Street View in Negombo, Sri Lanka, led to a few jokes on the social networking site Redditaposs forums, however, not everyone found it amusing One user said: His lil fingers can barely wrap around the handle. It’s sad when people have children in bad conditions.  Last month the Mirror told of a group of apparent cartel members wearing creepy masks have been unearthed on the app.The four masked men were seen standing on a road in Moctezuma in Sonora, Mexico. One of them is seen wearing a terrying Scream mask on and another a Mexican luchador face covering. A third is dressed like a werewolf alongside a man in a balaclava and hat. The men were photographed in the area once known for the Sonora Cartel, one of the oldest and best-established gangs in the country.

One woman now feels guilty after her boyfriend, Mike, overheard her making fun of his love of dopey scented candlesduring a phone call with a friend.The -year-old woman had no idea that he was in earshot at the time, and, given how he reacted, sheaposs worried that she might have taken her joke too far. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Taking to Reddit, the concerned girlfriend wrote: Mike has some interests that some might typically consider girly butthey make him happy I’m all for it.I like doing knitting and stuff like that and he’ll always askhe can do it with me and I’ll say yes and show him how to do it and he’s always super interested and wants to learn and stuff like that. She continued: Anyway, recently Mikeaposs gotten really into scented candles. I just think it’s kind of funny how into them he is because they’re kind of lame. But anyway, right before he left I was on the phone with my friend and said aposyeah Mikeaposs going to get those dopey scented candlesapos. He was in earshot and I didn’t realise. He got offended and left looking super upset. I texted him but he said he didn’t wanna talk because he thinks I was being mean. Although she believes that Mike, , is being oversensitive about the whole situation, she is now worried that she missed the mark somewhat with her joke. One fellow Reddit user advised: Dude youaposve got yourself a good boyfriend, the kind that wants to engage in your hobbies and does their own crafty stuff, and you decided to belittle him  Please don’t, don’t call his hobbies girly, respect the man and drop your bulls**t aposthis is not for menapos. People thinking like that is what gave us toxic masculinity. Stop propagating it to the few that actually want to express themselves. He’s too good for you. Another wrote: This man is taking interest in things that are against the social norm and is probably really self-conscious about it. You were the person he thought had his back and then you go and make jokes to your friends. Of course, heaposs hurt. Apologise and get this man a nice Yankee candle and hope he forgives you and maybe someday heaposll trust you enough to start sharing his interest in things again.Do you have a relationship-related story to tell  We pay for stories.

And now he has revealed how to perfectly prepare your sausages in five easy-to-follow steps.With more than three decades of experience working in a professional kitchen as an award-winning Michelin-starred chef, Jeff knows his stuff, says the Daily Star, so take note.Heaposs even shared some of the most common errors home cooks make - and pricking the sausages is a big no-no. For the perfect sausages, Jeff recommends cooking them as follows: For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. . Remove the sausages from the fridge  minutes before cooking. This helps the sausage to cook evenly and prevents the skin from splitting when it hits the heat. . Pop them into a heavy-based non-stick frying pan and place them on low to medium heat. . Add a teaspoon of duck or goose fat to the pan and swirl it around until the base is fully coated. Then tip away any excess fat.. Place the sausages in the pan, making sure they’re not touching each other and keep on constant heat. Turning them regularly ensures the bangers get a rich golden colour. Jeff recommends  to  minutes for a traditional thick sausage. . Rest the sausages before serving. Once the sausages are cooked, they will be firm to touch, with an internal temperature of °C. The secret now is to let the sausages rest for a few minutes, just like you would a steak allowing the meat to relax, giving you a tender, juicy sausage. Common mistakes Jeff also shared some of the most common mistakes people make when cooking sausages.The first is pricking the skins when cooking the sausages. This causes the juice to run out, meaning youaposll be left with a dry, tasteless sausage. He also urges people never to deep fry their sausages as this can also dry them out. And finally, baking your sausages - although this may seem like the healthiest option - doing so prevents the exterior from crisping up.

Sharing her story anonymously on Reddit, the woman explained she and her husband focused more on the honeymoon than the wedding when it came to planning their marriage, and after struggling through some financial problems caused by the Covid- pandemic, her in-laws offered to help contribute some funds to the event.And now that her honeymoon is just one week away, the womanaposs in-laws have demanded that they be allowed to come with the newlyweds because it was their money that helped pay for the holiday. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.In her post, she said: My fiancé proposed to me in a simple conversation. It was basically a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing, but I loved it regardless. We pondered on the wedding for a few weeks, but decided we didn’t want to spend most of our money on the wedding, but on a gorgeous ring and a fantastical honeymoon.What doesn’t work for us is that my then-fiance had just gotten laid off, which had left us in quite a financial problem. For the honeymoon option, we asked his parents who are pretty wealthythey could possibly lend us some money for it and the ring, and they said they’d be happy to. Next week is our honeymoon and we’ve been so excited, but five days ago my soon-to-be-in-laws came over for a visit. They basically brought us some wine, some flowers, some things to put into the new house that we had just moved into, and then they asked to talk to us separately.  My mother-in-law sat me down on my bed and told me that she was so happy for me and that she bet I was excited to go to the US. I laughed and agreed, and started talking about it but she cut me off and started saying things about how we’re so close, and we’re like a little family. Then she said, aposSince we’re so close, do you think me and my husband might tag along  It could be like a fun family trip!aposThe woman immediately told her mother-in-law no, but was branded selfish for not respecting that they had helped fund the honeymoon. She added: I told her, no, and she followed by saying how much sheaposs aposalways wanted to goapos, and that she aposnever got to have her own honeymoon.apos I told her I was sorry, but she couldn’t come as this was my honeymoon and was supposed to be a romantic trip between me and my new husband. She got very upset and met up with her husband who looked like he was about to rage. They basically teamed up on me and my fiancé and complained that they were the ones paying, they were the ones that raised him, and that they have done so much for us all these years. They said that it was my fault, and his dad said before I came along my fiance was smart, had his le together and respected his parents, and called me selfish. His parents have been sending me awful texts, and are now refusing to pay for the wedding. My parents have offered to help us pay, and we’re going less expensive now. Commenters were equally baffled by the post, with many saying a honeymoon is not the time for a family holiday. One person said: A honeymoon is not a family vacation. Why donapost they go by themselves  What do they think people do on their honeymoon  Postpone the wedding until you and your husband are on the same page. While another added: I get that they are paying, very generous but obviously the money comes with strings attached. Why can’t they go on a “honeymoon” by themselves instead of tagging along on someone ’s honeymoon  Just tell them to go on their own trip and let you go on yours.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON MarriageRelationshipsUmm what \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Putin said he has signed a decree that foreign buyers must pay in roubles for Russian gas and in a televised address claimed contracts would be haltedthese payments were not made.It is the Russian leaders strongest response yet to massive economic sanctions that have been imposed by the West on the country following its invasion of Ukraine. And a senior Russian foreign official said that the European Union will be hit hard for the sanctions, reported RIA.The actions of the EU will not remain unanswered ... the irresponsible sanctions by Brussels are already negatively affecting the daily lives of ordinary Europeans, Nikolai Kobrinets told the news agency.  European governments rejected Putinaposs ultimatum for Friday of payments in roubles, with the continentaposs biggest recipient of Russian gas, Germany, calling it blackmail. Moscow did, however, offer a mechanism for buyers to obtain roubles via a Russian bank. The energy showdown has huge ramications for Europe as US officials circle the globe to keep pressure on Putin to stop a five-week invasion that has uprooted a quarter of Ukraineaposs population. Europe wants to wean itself off Russian energy but that risks further inflating soaring fuel prices. Russia has a key revenue source at stake even as it reels from sanctions.Facing stf resistance from Ukraineaposs military, Putin has played one of his biggest cards in the demand on European energy buyers. They must open rouble accounts in Russian banks. It is from these accounts that payments will be made for gas delivered starting from tomorrow, Putin said.  If such payments are not made , we will consider this a default on the part of buyers, with all the ensuing consequences ... existing contracts will be stopped.With the war exacerbating global fuel prices, US President Joe Biden launched the largest release ever from the US oil reserve and challenged oil giants to drill more.This is a moment of consequence and peril for the world, Biden said as he announced a release of  million barrels starting in May. But that amount fails to cover a US loss of Russian oil, which Biden banned this month. Western governments say Putinaposs demand for rouble payments would be a breach of contracts in euro or dollars. An order signed by Putin allows customers to send foreign currency to a designated account at Russiaaposs Gazprombank, which would thenroubles for the gas buyer to make payment. Russia would have to physically halt gas flows to EU  to force the issue, marking a major escalation not even performed at the height of the Cold War. It would mark another major financial blow to Russiaaposs coffers, said analysts at Fitch Solutions.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll boosts oban ahead of slockavullin final","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA group of five young Mid Argyll rugby players were in action last weekend as part of Oban Lorne under-s in the semi final of the West Youth Shield.The result of the match on Sunday March  didn#t go their way, as opponents East Kilbride ran out  #  winners, but it was a good contest and close game until Oban players sustained a few injuries and East Kilbride scored a couple of breakaway tries.Oban Lorne and the Mid Argyll contingent # Rhys Coffield, Murray MacDonald, Vinnie Buckley, James Campbell and Sorley Self # have had a great season, winning their West under- development league, so there is plenty for the lads to be proud of.If anyone would like to enjoy some rugby this weekend, Mid Argyll under- boys will be playing on Saturday March  in the final of the West Youth Chairman#s Trophy against Kilmarnock RFC at Slockavullin.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous.

settings such as places of worship and wedding or funeral ceremonies, however.Nicola Sturgeon said continuing to require facemasks by law for a further two weeks struck a \"sensible balance\" amid signs that the BA. Omicron wave in Scotland is beginning to peak or stabilise.The number of people in hospital with Covid fell from , to , in the past  hours The Covid threat level is expected to be reduced from medium to low during Spring, said the First Minister.Ms Sturgeon said: \"This phased approach strikes a sensible balance between our desire to remove this one remaining legal measure, and the common sense need for continued caution - not least for the sake of the NHS - while this wave of infection subsides.\"I recognize that face coverings are an inconvenience. However, given all the sacrice of the past two years, and in view of the current pressure on the NHS, I believe the vast majority of people will accept that for a further two weeks this is a proportionate precautionary measure while we pass the peak of this latest wave.\"It also provides some further protection to those who are most at risk from the virus.\"Compulsory face coverings have already come to an end in all other parts of the UK, with England - which briefly reintroduced them in December as part of its Plan B response to the Omicron wave - becoming the first to drop the requirement at the end of January.  #COVID infections continued to increase across England, Wales and Scotland in the most recent week, but decreased in Northern Ireland.These high infection levels are driven by the Omicron BA. iant https:t.co zjZZxROXBX pic CSjbiIxM In February, Northern Ireland switched facemasks from law to guidance, but still strongly advises the public to wear them in enclosed public spaces such as shops, bars, restaurants and public transport.Since Monday, people in Wales have no longer been required to wear facemasks in shops and on public transport, but they are still mandatory in health and care settings. The latest surveillance by the Office for National Statistics  indicates that the prevalence of Covid is highest in Scotland - with one in  people infected - despite the ongoing mask law. The next surveillance figures will be released on Friday.Surgical and cotton masks are known to be less effective against the highly transmissible BA.

Visiting one is a chance not only to hear from established authors and new writers, but to explore the countryside.You’d be surprised at how many best-selling authors jump at the chance of meeting with readers in the smallest converted stable-block or village hall, preferring this close contact to the impersonal atmosphere of bigger venues.

It runs to more than we will ever know.Jane Lax, Aberlour.BIGGER SHAMBLES AT WESTMINSTERBRIAN Chrystalwrites that “the incompetenceof some parts of the Westminster Government is undeniable but so is the case of the ferries” and for good measure and emphasis, “other aspects of delivering public services”.The previous day, John Shanksmade much the same point when he claimed that “faced with examples of SNP incompetence at Holyrood” independence supporters typically point to “something the Conservatives at Westminster did wrong”.However, both miss the critical point of scale. The ferries fiasco – and that is the correct description, for it is a fiasco – has to date a cost overrun of £ million, but that is expected to rise before the ships see service. So, lets put a contingency of another  per cent on, so £m. Not a project to put at the top – or anywhere near – your CV.However, as both Messrs Crystal and Shanks have mentioned Westminster, let’s look at a couple of instances from there.First up is that some % of PPE contracts, awarded between the beginning of the pandemic and November , have been identied as possibly corrupt, at a cost to the taxpayer estimated at £. billion.Second is that £.bn has just been written off by HM Treasury for fraudulent loans made during the height of the Covid epidemic. In addition it is estimated that loans that will have to be written off business cannot repay could amount to anything up to £bn.All in all, just these two shambles have cost the UK taxpayer anything up to £bn. The ferry fiasco has cost .% of that.No, the ferry fiasco is not something to be praised, but then again, the above considerations do appear to confirm that Westminster does do at least one thing better than Holyrood.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.TOXIC CULTURE BLAME LIES WITH SNPTHE First Minister is correct in saying that our political culture is more toxic now.

Part of the hike will go to fill the hole left by the collapse of energy firms taxpayers are already on the hook for the £ billion bail-out of Bulb energy.Scotland’s consumers also suffer from the discriminatory National Grid charges set by Ofgem whereby our renewables industries pay the highest connection charges in Europe at £. per megawatt hour, which is more than double that of our nearest competitors in Yorkshire and Humberside which have attracted most of the recent investment.Astonishingly, Norway can feed energy into our National Grid at a cost of £. per megawatt hour. France pays p per megawatt hour while Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg pay nothing to feed into our grid.To make matters worse, the National Grid sold a % stake in Britain’s gas pipeline infrastructure to Australian investment firms for more than £bn. They will be looking to increase profits from UK consumers.As energy is reserved to Westminster, there is little chance of things improving prior to independence.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh.* IN February  Scottish Power CEO Keith Anderson said energy prices would fall “in a few years” due to the expansion of renewables. However, in his article on renewables todayhe doesnt mention cost.My per-unit price for electricity has just risen from p to p overnight, and the daily charge has gone up from p to p. In what year will our bills come down, Mr Anderson Geoff Moore, Alness.WHEN WILL NORTH BE ON TRACK THANK you for today’s essays on Scotland’s future railways . All three contributors made many interesting suggestions, but with little reference to the need to properly connect Inverness and Aberdeen.The billions spent on “creating a genuinely world class railway system across central Scotland” [Iain Docherty] and the introduction of Scotland’s InterCity trains to “offer competitive journey times on most routes” [John McCormick] are really welcome. However, this still leaves the cities of Perth, Inverness and Aberdeen out in the cold for journey times and line capacity. As far back as April , the CEO of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce observed that “single-track sections of the railways linking Inverness, Aberdeen and the Central Belt are unacceptable in the st century.”Talk of a “three-hour London-Glasgow Edinburgh rail journey target time” is surely premature when this same target set for Inverness-Glasgow Edinburgh by the then First Minister in August  for completion by  is nowhere near being achieved. Indeed the Edinburgh-Inverness average journey time looks set to increase by another few minutes to three hours  minutes with the May  timetable.Three hours by rail was Priority  in the  Strategic Transport Projects Reviewto follow the Queensferry Crossing and the Edinburgh-Glasgow Rail Improvement Projects , both of which were completed long ago. Will STPR live up to the Strategic in its name and expedite this so that the Moray Firth, Moray and Aberdeen economies can soon get the freight and passenger connectivity which they sorely need RJ Ardern, Inverness.Read more: Now tell us why Ferguson was scored so highly in the bid process"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-scots-limerick-sting-tale","story":"This is confirmed in the following limerick:\"A lively young damsel named MenziesInquired: \"Do you know what this thenzies \"Her aunt, with a gasp,Replied:\"Its a wasp,And youre holding the end where the stenzies.\"David Miller, Milngavie.POWERFUL PARENTINGI’M sure some of us will have voiced ied formative experiences which “made me who I am today”, as instanced by Mark Smith .In my own case I like to claim that it was pure thoughts and good deeds which brings to mind a Father’s Day card I received from one of my progeny some years ago which read “You made me the person I am today.

The company runs an Unfolded impact program to support children in India.Cally Russell, co-founder and CEO of This is Unfolded said the company aims to show there is a dferent way for the industry to operate.“The fashion industry is notoriously bad for the environment with % of new clothes made never being sold,” he explained. The aim behind This is Unfolded is to make sustainable clothing collections at an affordable price point.CEO Cally Russell “We know from our own research that more and more people want to buy sustainably but that often the cost can be prohibitive. With This is Unfolded we are building a completely new retail model, one that delivers sustainable and affordable clothes and avoids waste and overproduction. We then use the savings that this approach allows, to pay garment workers better wages and to create long term impact in manufacturing communities through funding children’s education.”Nothing in the collection costs more than £ and yet the garment workers are paid a living wage.“This is Unfolded removes this waste from the production and sales process to deliver truly sustainable clothing collections. The savings made are then used to improve lives – by paying workers better and creating long term change by supporting children in India in education,” Russell added.In  the company launched three collections and grew to thousands of customers across the UK – supporting over , children in education for  months through their innovative approach.The team behind This is Unfolded has a history of creating impact in the fashion industry, having established clothing initiative Lost Stock during the pandemic.It was set up to support garment workers as fashion retailers cancelled billions of pounds worth of stock orders due to the lockdown forcing the closure of stores. It left factories in countries like Bangladesh with unwanted new clothes and no way to pay their workers.Lost Stock sold this stock to consumers as ‘mystery clothing boxes’ to fund support for over , workers and their families for a month each.The success of the initiative made the team want to create something more permanent.“This is Unfolded offers capsule collections of affordable, sustainably-made clothes,” Russell said. “This new way to produce and sell clothes is powered by data, community and a factory to consumer model. Clothes are only produced once orders are placed, removing overstock and ensuring demand is matched to production.“We have just launched our fourth collection designed in collaboration with our co-creator community of over  customers who have provided feedback on styles, prints, fit and much more throughout the design process. Clothes are then only produced when orders are placed so as to avoid any overproduction.”As well as creating a new production and consumer model, the company also supports children’s education in India, through its charity partner Pratham.“We are currently funding the education of  children in India for the next year and with collection four we hope to add another  children to this,” Russell said.“So we offer clothes that not only look great but that are better for the environment, the workers and society – in order to do this all we ask of our customers is that they wait four to six weeks for delivery.”www.thisisunfolded  "},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for.

We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry. What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreOnce approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year.

The largest online trading group had more than , members and dozens of posts per week, it said. vw,vw,px, px\"A woman displays monitor lizards, squirrels and wild birds for sale at an open air market in Attapeu, Laos The animals and animal parts bought and sold involved elephants, bears and gibbons, Tibetan antelope, critically endangered pangolins and an Asian giant tortoise.The most popular mammals were ious species of langurs and monkeys, often bought as pets.Most of the animals advertised for sale were taken from the wild. They also included civets, which along with pangolins have been identied as potential vectors in the spread of diseases such as Sars and Covid-.Shaun Martin, who heads the WWF’s Asia-Pacic regional cybercrime project, said monitoring of the online wildle trade shows dferent species being kept close together, sometimes in the same cage.“With Asia’s track record as a breeding ground for many recent zoonotic diseases, this sharp uptick in online trade of wildle in Myanmar is extremely concerning,” he said. vw,vw,px, px\"One of  tigers cubs seized from smugglers has blood samples taken from veterinary team from the wildle forensic unit to trace the DNA, in Thailand The unregulated trade in wild species and resulting interactions between wild species and humans raise the risks of new and possibly vaccine-resistant mutations of illnesses such as Covid- that could evolve undetected in non-human hosts into more dangerous iants of disease, experts say.Covid- is one of many diseases traced back to animals. The killing and sale of what is known as bushmeat in Africa was thought to be a source for Ebola. Bird flu likely came from chickens at a market in Hong Kong in . Measles is believed to have evolved from a virus that infected cattle.Social media and other online s have joined a worldwide effort to crack down on the thriving trade in birds, reptiles, mammals and animal parts.In Myanmar, much of the trade in wildle is through Facebook, which as a member of the Coalition to End Wildle Trafficking online has taken action to block or remove accounts of people engaged in such transactions.Highlighting the lack of enforcement, people in the illegal wildle trade in Myanmar often use rudimentary methods of moving the animals and animal products around – with buses being the usual form of transport.The study by WWF in Myanmar focused on trade online of animals and other creatures inside the country, though there were some imports from neighbouring Thailand, mainly of birds such as cockatoos and parrots and of crocodiles, to India.Some deals might involve animals or parts being sent into China, it said.The conservation group said it plans future studies to better understand Myanmar’s role in the global trade in endangered species."},{"url":null,"title":"daniil-medvedev-misses-chance-return-world-number-one-miami-open-loss  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Council remains strongly committed to ensuring Mid and East Antrim is an accessible, safe, welcoming and inclusive place for every person living in or visiting the Borough. In , it was awarded the prestigious ‘Autism Impact Award’ for six of its venues in recognition of “going above and beyond” to create accessible and ‘autism-friendly’ environments – including Seven Towers Leisure Centre and The People’s Park.

This increase will see the yearly gas bill of a typical household with a credit meter rise by about pound per year to pound,. Those customerswith a prepayment gas meterwill see costs increase by around pound per year to pound,. Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “It is important that consumers are made aware that their domestic gas bills will stay high for at least the next year because the wholesale price that the companies pay for the gas continues to be much more expensive than the norm. Unfortunately heating oil prices are also very high, so regardless of the fuel we use, many of us will experience extreme pressure on our household budgets. This will further increase the numbers of people in fuel poverty, as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating. “As the Winter   Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme ends today , we implore firmus energy, and the wider energy industry, to commit to financially supporting the continuation of a fuel hardship scheme in the coming financial year. For the longer term, it is clear that energy companies, policy makers, the Utility Regulator, charities and the Consumer Council must continue to work together to develop sustainable solutions to help support those in need as the problem of high energy prices will likely be with us for the foreseeable future.” Consumers who are struggling to pay their energy bills or struggling to pay to top-up their meter should contact their supplier directly for support. Consumers can also get in touch with the Consumer Council for free, independent advice by calling Freephone    or by emailingcontact@consumercouncil.org.uk.

The forthcoming election is set to be postponed for a fortnight due to insufficient amounts of the correct type of ballot paper, we understand. It is believed that the specic type of tree used to make the paper - Flora Plio – has been in short supply in recent months. Paper production expert, Poppy Cox, explained why this specic type of tree was used for the production of ballot papers. “It has a special waxy quality that prevents the mark you make on your ballot paper being rubbed out,” said Mrs Cox. “That obviously adds an added level of security to the elections and stops people claiming that their ballot has been changed.” Alternatives are now being sought and the two week delay in the vote will hopefully allow for the ballot to be printed on a dferent type of paper. “It is possible that we could see a special kind of foolscap being useda secure alternative can’t be found,” Mrs Cox added.

Tonight we are still looking at a mixture of showers and clear spells,” she said.Initially,you’re near the north coast that’s where you’re most likely to encounter the showers and some cloudier skies.“However, the further south you are it’s more likely you’ll get some clear spells.

Credit :Sinn FeinGarrett HarganTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA victims’ campaigner has questioned the use of the Europa Hotel as the setting for Sinn Fein’s election launch, saying it’s a venue the Provisional IRA “systematically bombed”.On Tuesday, Michelle O’Neill gave a speech at the Great Victoria Street hotel, which was bombed  times during the Troubles.She outlined Sinn Fein’s priorities ahead of the upcoming election including the cost of living crisis and “fiercely defending” the Good Friday Agreement.“The facts are that the balance of power at Stormont has shted irreversibly and political unionism must come to terms with the fact the world is moving on fast,” Ms O’Neill said.“So, while the DUP and the TUV are trying to take us backwards, our message is clear, we are only moving forward.”Commenting on the choice of venue, Kenny Donaldson, spokesman for Innocent Victims United said: Sinn Fein clearly don#t do irony, to bleat on about upholding democracy at the very venue which the Provisional IRA systematically attacked again and again, making it the most bombed hotel in Europe is brazen to say the least.However, due to the intensity of the Provisional IRA#s bombing campaign — and that of other terrorists, few hotel venues across Northern Ireland have come away unscathed by the Troubles.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up TUV South Belfast candidate Andrew Girvin said Sinn Fein’s campaign launch at the Europa was a “grotesque spectacle” given the setting.“Here we had the political wing of the terrorist organisation which repeatedly bombed the hotel in which they met daring to ponticate about democracy and respecting the will of the people.“There is nothing undemocratic about refusing to operate the Belfast Agreement structures which could foist a Sinn Fein First Minister upon Northern Ireland.“The choice of venue for this republican jamboree underscores the fact that no unionist should ever agree to take up the position of deputy to a Sinn Fein First Minister.“Yet just weeks out from the election both the DUP and UUP are dodging this vital question.Will they act as bridesmaid to Michelle O#Neill  Why is there reluctance to be open and honest with the public on this point ”The DUP#s Gordon Lyons said Sinn Fein#s election launch demonstrates their priority lies on holding a border poll rather than on helping families or rebuilding Northern Ireland’s economy.The party#s director of elections said: Sinn Fein#s rally was a show of strength for a border poll.“Whilst the DUP has a five-point plan to build a better future for Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein wants to win the election to implement their plan for a border poll.“There is a clear choice on offer to people whether they want a future focused on fixing our health system, tackling the cost of living crisis and replacing the protocol, or one fixated on a isive border poll.“When Michelle O#Neill talks about making history, we know it isn#t record levels of investment into our hospitals she is referring to. Now is not the time for ision and uncertainty.That is why this election is so important.Sinn Fein has been contacted for comment.Speaking at an election launch, Ms O’Neill said that Sinn Fein will defend but not renegotiate the Good Friday Agreement.The former Deputy First Minister said those who hanker for the past need to realise that there is no going back, only forward.Sinn Fein#s Stormont leader also described the DUP#s collapse of the Executive as political vandalism, although her own party also brought Stormont down in the same Assembly mandate.She said: When the Assembly, Executive and North South Ministerial Council were restored in January  it was with a shared commitment to deliver the public services, societal reforms and future that our people need and deserve.It was ambitious to form a five-party coalition Executive, but it was achieved, getting us back to genuine power-sharing, and thankfully so, because while everyone knew there would be challenges ahead, no one could have predicted that in only a matter of weeks that our Executive would be dealing with a global pandemic that would have such devastating impacts on every part of society, community and people#s lives and livelihoods.It is to the credit of all ministers from across the five parties that they responded and have worked with a unity of purpose, and unity of leadership for the past two years.This is what the public want to see more of — co-operation and delivery.Ms O#Neill added: Sinn Fein will be defending, not renegotiating the Good Friday Agreement now, or in the time ahead.Ms O#Neill said the May  election was the most important in a generation.Related topicsSinn FéinMichelle O#NeillIRACost of LivingTraditional Unionist VoiceGordon LyonsThe Executive OfficeMore On Sinn Féin PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapse PremiumSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatCriticism as Electric Ireland customers facing nearly £ rise in annual bills PremiumJust £k spent as multi-million pound Northern Ireland football stadiums scheme lies idle PremiumRepublic of Ireland should maintain its military neutrality, say three quarters of Sinn Fein votersMost ReadBomb hoax: North Belfast gym owner appears in court charged in connection with alert at peace eventHow to spot the Northern Lights over Northern Ireland tonightHaving a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DayEx-Irish badminton champ paid mums to let him abuse childrenSinn Fein slammed for election launch at Belfast’s Europa Hotel which was repeatedly bombed by IRATop Videos programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

Credit: Brian Lawless PAMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe UUP manesto has enough meat to show that the party is starting to think seriously about being a major player in the Executive once more, and enough bare bones to reveal that the process is incomplete.At , words, this document is serious in its scope and suffused with the liberal unionist tone of new leader Doug Beattie.But it is what this manesto does not say which reveals most: hard choices or unpopular proposals are either absent or presented in oblique terms — and that jars with Mr Beattie’s straight-talking style.Health is the first and the iest section — unsurprisingly, given that polling has shown Robin Swann to be Stormont’s most popular minister.The manesto indicates support for radical measures, saying that the pandemic has shown that both patients and medics are willing “to travel longer distancesit means receiving care and support in a more timely manner. It is essential that the opportunities currently before us are not lost”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreNo united Ireland for generations to come, UUP leader insistsAndrew Madden:OpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeThat seems to hint at support for implementing the decades of reports which say Northern Ireland has too many small hospitals, some of which need to be closed or downgraded to centralise expertise in centres of excellence.But the UUP is not explicit about this.There are other hints of centralising services — “a regionally consistent approach to cancer services across Northern Ireland” with “regional pathways and rapid diagnostic clinics”.The party also proposes greater evening and weekend use of theatres, but hints at the cost by saying it will mean “properly incentivising the move towards a genuine seven day a week health service”.Signicantly, the party says it would ban the use of contract agency workers — but only “once the immediate HSC pressures subside” .Health trusts are sharply criticised, with the UUP saying that for too long “sub-optimal trust performances [have been] tolerated”, something which suggests frustration at what Mr Swann has seen within the system.His solution is a new operationally independent HSC chief executive accountable to a board with political, professional and civic society membership, similar to the Policing Board.On the NI Protocol, the UUP says that “unionists cannot accept an internal border within the United Kingdom. There can be no border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain”.That simple commitment seems to prevent the UUP signing up to any revised protocol involving an Irish Sea border.Its tone is dferent to the DUP, talking about wanting to “maintain good relations with the EU”, but the content is similar to that of the ERG — pushing mutual enforcement, with a new north-south body to oversee this. A requirement to label GB goods coming into NI “for UK sale only” would only avoid a new Irish Sea borderit was enforced for all UK products.The party would ban gay conversion therapy, establish a gambling regulator, allocate overdue investment to football stadia, and examine letting private garages do MoT tests.The party opposes a Troubles amnesty and robustly says paramilitaries “need to be put out of business permanently” by focussing on their leaderships and criminal assets. It wants to curb legal aid, due to “the culture of lawfare which has been allowed to develop within our legal system and which has proved extremely lucrative for a number of firms”.The manesto is laden with more spending — new train stops, new busses, new roads, more rates relief for some businesses, spending on city deals,  more police officers, and looking at giving everyone in primary school a free meal.How this would be paid for is unclear. There is no talk of increasing rates. Water charges are ruled out. And giving Stormont more tax powers is also rejected. Changing the status of NI Waterand the Housing Executive to allow them to borrow is about as far as funding proposals go.This is a detailed document, yet many of the proposals are all things to all people – it is pro-business, but also pro-worker pro-grammar schools, but looking to review how academic selection operates, pro-EU, but anti-protocol.None of those things are necessarily contradictory, but in not being clearer about some of the most controversial or unpopular areas, the party is putting off having to take those decisions until after they’ve got the votes.Related topicsUlster Unionist PartyDoug BeattieThe Executive OfficeRobin SwannNI ProtocolMore On Ulster Unionist Party PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapseAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudge PremiumJust £k spent as multi-million pound Northern Ireland football stadiums scheme lies idleCarrickfergus murder probe: Woman’s horror at reservoir body find PremiumSam McBrideOpinionDUP gains ground, but overall support drops for ided unionismMost ReadBomb hoax: North Belfast gym owner appears in court charged in connection with alert at peace eventHow to spot the Northern Lights over Northern Ireland tonightHaving a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DayEx-Irish badminton champ paid mums to let him abuse childrenSinn Fein slammed for election launch at Belfast’s Europa Hotel which was repeatedly bombed by IRATop Videos programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

Credit: Liam McBurneySuzanne BreenTwitterEmailApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailSDLP MP Claire Hanna has spoken of her shock at a Sinn Fein proposal to abolish the constituency of South Belfast.In a submission to the Boundary Commission, the party proposes the constituency is axed with its voters largely ided between two other constituencies — despite South Belfast having more voters than either East or West Belfast.Ms Hanna said Sinn Fein’s proposal “does not make any mathematical sense” and that residents would be stunned it was seeking to abolish Northern Ireland’s most politically erse constituency.Sinn Fein has been contacted for comment.South Belfast currently is the only constituency toMLAs from five dferent parties: SDLP, DUP, Alliance, Sinn Fein and Greens.Ms Hanna said: “Each of Belfast’s four constituencies has a distinct identity, community cohesion, and things they are proud of. South Belfast has for decades been known as a erse, integrated part of the city where people of all political views and none live side-by-side.“Many people chose to settle in South Belfast precisely because of that. This constituency is, and always has been, a shared space.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “It is pluralist in its politics and values, and I think residents would be very disconcerted and concerned at a proposal to break it up and to parcel bits off into other constituencies.”Read MoreTalks need to begin over scrapping mandatory coalition, says Arlene FosterThe rules for the  Boundary Commission review mean each constituency must have an electorate of between , and ,.North Belfastand South Belfastfall within the target range. West Belfastand East Belfastdo not.Ms Hanna lodged her objections to Sinn Fein’s proposal at a meeting with the Boundary Commission last month.“West and East Belfast are below the statutory electoral range by , and , voters respectively,” she said.“The high level of house-building in South Belfast, particularly in the Four Winds and Malone, together with the council’s determination to repopulate the city core, means the number of electors in South Belfast is going to rise further within a parliamentary term.“The Boundary Commission was happy for Northern Ireland to keep all its  seats. In previous proposals in , which were dropped, it had wanted to reduce to  seats, so somewhere would have had to take the fall.“Sinn Fein’s proposal is even more surprising when the Boundary Commission isn’t even looking to lose a seat.”Under Sinn Fein’s plan, Belfast would be reduced from four constituencies to three.East Belfast would remain, absorbing parts of South Belfast, and two new constituencies would be created — North West Belfast and South West Belfast.Ormeau, Rosetta, and Ravenhill would be moved into East Belfast. Malone, Stranmillis, and Finaghy would be put into the new South West Belfast constituency.Demographic trends suggest Sinn Fein would secure both the South West and North West Belfast seats at a Westminster election, with the SDLP losing out. The influx of South Belfast voters to the east of the city would help Alliance unseat the DUP there.In its submission to the Boundary Commission, Michelle O’Neill’s party says: “Sinn Fein believe that too much emphasis is placed in trying to keep Belfast as four-seater constituency which comes at the detriment to the rest of the constituencies.”Under the Boundary Commission’s plan, South Belfast remains largely intact, but gains the rural wards of Drumbo, Saintfield, and Moneyreagh to become South Belfast and Mid Down. Strangford would be renamed Strangford and Quoile.Professor Jon Tonge of the University of Liverpool said the commission’s proposed boundary changes were “fairly minimalist”.“Fermanagh and South Tyrone — very marginal — becomes fractionally more nationalist, which will please Sinn Fein. Foyle becomes a bit more nationalist, and East Londonderry a bit more unionist,” he said.Related topicsClaire HannaSinn FéinSDLPAlliance PartyGreen PartyMore On Claire HannaSir Jeffrey Donaldson and Doug Beattie to share stage on youth mental health issues this weekendNorthern Ireland could be set to welcome Ukrainian refugees under new Home Office visa scheme PremiumJon TongeOpinionSDLP and Sinn Fein could swap unity manestos and no one would notice PremiumSDLP’s Colum Eastwood: ‘SF are focused on themselves and on securing jobs for their friends’Ian Paisley ‘took most freebies of all Northern Ireland MPs’… DUP veteran accepted tickets to Open and British Grand PrixMost ReadBomb hoax: North Belfast gym owner appears in court charged in connection with alert at peace eventHow to spot the Northern Lights over Northern Ireland tonightHaving a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DayEx-Irish badminton champ paid mums to let him abuse childrenSinn Fein slammed for election launch at Belfast’s Europa Hotel which was repeatedly bombed by IRATop Videos programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

Let’s not try and put articial fixes into some constituencies and chop and change the larger rural ones west of the Bann.If that does involve some changes in the Belfast constituencies then so be it, but it needs to be an honest and scientic assessment.Not one which attempts to shore up political positions in and around the city of Belfast at the expense of rural areas.”During the interview, Mr Murphy was also askedhe believed there would still be a Stormont Executive after the Assembly election in May.This follows uncertainty over whether the DUP would accept Sinn Fein nominating a First Minister.That’s not a question for Sinn Fein, we will be in the Executive. We want to be in the Executive,” he said.We believe the best situation going forward is for all of the parties to work together.If the DUP do not want to be in an Executive they have the option to opt out of one and allow the rest of the parties to get on with the decision making.But the idea that their protest against the Protocol is having any impact on thenegotiation is risible.The actual impact it’s having is on the people we serve here, the people that we represent are suffering because we can’t get budgets done, we can’t get decisions taken.If the DUP are not prepared to go back into the Executive well don’t go back in, but don’t hold back the rest of society.”On the former First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster’s claim that it’s time to scrap mandatory power sharing, Mr Murphy noted that any party retained the right to opt out of the Executive.Read MoreTalks need to begin over scrapping mandatory coalition, says Arlene FosterIf the DUP, who were the party most consistently at odds with the other four parties over the course of the last two years, don’t wish to be in the Executive then that’s a matter for themselves,” he said.Mandatory coalition doesn’t mean that everyone has to be in the Executive, it’s not compulsory.It means you’re entitled to be inyou wish to be in.”On whether the DUP could end up in opposition with Sinn Fein in power, Mr Murphy said all parties working together remained the best option.Related topicsConor MurphyMore On Conor Murphy PremiumFears for Belfast economy as exodus of % of civil servants to regional hubs loomsSpring statement: ‘Nowhere near good enough...’ Chancellor Rishi Sunak gets a cool reception in Northern IrelandNI Protocol ‘front of mind’ in Washington PremiumGail WalkerOpinionAirbrushing of Trimble in US a reminder to unionists of their true place on island of IrelandCommunities Minister Hargey silent on cost of long-delayed plan to upgrade football stadiumsMost ReadBomb hoax: North Belfast gym owner appears in court charged in connection with alert at peace eventHow to spot the Northern Lights over Northern Ireland tonightHaving a laugh:  top office-themed pranks for April Fool’s DayEx-Irish badminton champ paid mums to let him abuse childrenSinn Fein slammed for election launch at Belfast’s Europa Hotel which was repeatedly bombed by IRATop Videos programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

Credit: Press Eye Darren Kidd“No, we did not get everything right,” she told the audience, adding that decisions made had an impact they did not foresee.She highlighted the impact on vulnerable children kept away from school and elderly people who spent the last weeks of their lives in isolation.More broadly,some political leaders pushed back against specic advice “that was somehow endangering health and more interested in wealth”.“It was really, really unhelpful,” Mrs Foster said. “In a one-party governmentwould have been struggling but we were in a five-party coalition.” She added that some in the Executive wanted everything shut down while she advocated what she claims was a more common sense approach.“But we had to find common ground,” Mrs Foster added.On the argument made by some in the business community the region will be in a unique position with a foot in both the EU and GB, Mrs Foster said in the interview with thethat she does not agree with that point of view.She said: “No, I do not. First of all because we are part of the United Kingdom, most of our supply chain is from the UK. If you look at people who rely on goods coming — whether it is manufacturing or retail — they have to get the goods from GB into Northern Ireland and sometimes go back to GB again.“The problem is from GB to Northern Ireland and, therefore, that has to be fixed.”Mrs Foster further argued: “Economics are very important and I have always been interested in the economy of Northern Ireland...but societally this is causing real problems in Northern Ireland because people feel that their identity as citizens is being eroded.“That goes way beyond economic issues. That is a problem and therefore needs to be sorted.“You cannot separate the economy from the societal issues.” Questioned on whether other issues facing both the UK government and the EU, including the Ukraine crisis, may hold up thrashing out a deal that would essentially remove those barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, Mrs Foster said: “I would have thought the Ukraine would have pointed to a need to actually sort out these issues more so than anything .” She added: “In the sense thatyou have a sovereign country that has been invaded as you have in the Ukraine, does that not say Boris Johnson as Prime Minister should look to his sovereign borders as well and deal with the issues that are there “Yes, to me he should be dealing with the issues within his own jurisdiction.”On the Protocol protests, Mrs Foster said she will leave those to the politicians but that she has not attended any rallies — and has not been invited.The former Fermanagh-South Tyrone MLA does not believe the Executive will be up and running in the immediate aftermath of the election but that should not impact business to any great extent.“Businesses are making their decisions not on what is happening at Stormont, quite frankly, they are making their decisions on does it make good business sense, what are the costs, have we got the people, have we got the skills that we need ”More generally, she supports the X strategy, stating: “That focus on innovation is very important, to get an edge on other parts of the world, to find out niches and I think we have been quite good at that, cyber security, financial technology, creative, film and television.”Following her forced resignation nearly a year ago, Mrs Foster said she made a “a decision that I still wanted to advocate for Northern Ireland because I love the place”.She added: “I will never talk down Northern Ireland.”Related topicsArlene FosterNI ProtocolUkraineThe Executive OfficeBoris JohnsonMore On Arlene Foster PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionWith five weeks to go until Northern Ireland election, Sinn Fein remain in pole positionLove, laughter and tears... how NI’s famous faces celebrated ‘special mums’ PremiumLucidTalk boss defends election polling as a sign of Northern Ireland becoming ‘a normal society’DUP veteran who quit after ousting of Arlene Foster ‘delighted’ to run for party in Assembly election PremiumMartin McGuinness: ‘History will judge him kinder than Gerry Adams.

Irsquod just broken up with my first girlfriend and I think it was me subconsciously expressing stuff about that.Confirming the sci-fi influence, Tim mdash who recently became a dad for the first time mdash said Girl From Mars mostly revolves around the verse and chorus.ldquoI wrote them as a slow little strummy thing and then when we worked on it as a band we rocked it out quite a lot. My little brother Pat was always my first port of call of seeinga song was good and then Irsquod bring it to [bandmates] Mark [Hamilton] and Rick [McMurray].ldquoI used to love going and knocking on his bedroom door and playing him ideas and I remember that he flipped out about the song and loved it. He had the idea for the quiet verse after the guitar solo and it was great.Tim said as soon as the band started playing it they got a really good reaction from their friends.ldquoI used to play stuff before Irsquod even fully written the lyrics wersquod play stuff at shows and Irsquod mumble my way through it. I donrsquot think I wrote the second verse until we actually recorded it two years later.ldquoI wasnrsquot too worried about lyrics back then, maybe because I listened to Nirvana so much and could never really understand them. Our manager and the record label were sure it was going to be a hit, so we put it aside until wersquod be able to promote it. We put it out as a single two weeks after leaving school and it just blew up.Meanwhile, as part of the Church Street investment plan in Downpatrick, around pound, has been earmarked for a shop front improvement scheme with the emphasis on painting and repairing existing facades.Elsewhere, it is proposed to spend pound, on what is being described as a ldquoconcept design of Church Street with the work due to be carried out by a consultant, with pound, earmarked for improving shop fronts in Bridge Street.Fteen thousand pounds has been earmarked for De Courcey Place in English Street to replace a number of heritage-style lamps and signposts, alongside the provision of new litter bins and planting out existing granite water troughs.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange, with new safety railings installed outside  Church Street.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Last Christmas, new festive lighting was provided on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has praised everyone involved with the work in Church Street, in particular, the talented artists responsible for the murals.ldquoCongratulations to everyone involved in the project designed to breath new le into this part of the town. Given the fact that it has missed out on major funding over many years, the pound, investment initiative is particularly welcome, he said.ldquoThe money will help property owners revitalise their respective businesses at a key part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynagross make it past Castlewellan  ","story":"BALLYNAGROSS progressed to the final of the Harry Clarke Cup after defeating Castlewellan Forest by way of penalty shoot-out at Ballyhornan on Friday night.Ballynagross arrived at the match looking for a fourth Harry Clarke final in a row, but Castlewellan Forest had momentum following a close win against Ardglass in the quarter-final.Ballynagross got off to the best start they could have hoped for after a great attack from their defence through the field found Philip Doran, who easily finished to put his side one up in the first seven minutes.Castlewellan stepped it up a gear when a throw-in close to the box found Aidan Dornan, who headed just wide.Castlewellan had an appeal for hand ball ruled out closely after in the Ballynagross box, with the referee having none of it.Ballynagross responded to the pressure from Castlewellan with a pass from Philip Doran to Shea McComiskey out on the right wing. McComiskey saw team-mate Joseph Burns in the mouth of the goal and looped the ball in, but Burnsrsquo effort goes just wide.Castlewellan had their first real chance on the th minute when their corner-kick met the head of Donagh Steele. However, the ball went just over the bar.Ballynagross got their second goal on the th minute after a throw-in from Ryan Tumelty to John Shields allowed the attacker to spray a pass to the right wing to find team-mate Doran. The lively lsquoGross forward found Joseph Burns and the chance was duly converted into a goal.With half-time nearing, it looked like Ballynagross would be going into the interval with a comfortable lead, but an error when clearing the ball from the defence enabled Castlewellanrsquos David Gilmore to close the lead to just a goal as the referee blew his whistle.Castlewellan came out in the second-half with an all out attack approach and it paid off through a corner kick in the st minute.This time Donagh Steele ensured the ball was going into the back of the net and the game was level. It was not to stay this way for long as the Castlewellan goalkeeper clearly took Ballynagrossrsquo Shea McComiskey down inside the box and a penalty was awarded.Connor Marron stepped up to take the penalty and finished well into the top left corner of the net.Castlewellan continued to push forward, but Ballynagross defence of Corey Davis, Connor Marron, Ryan Tumelty and Tom McNeill were holding strong.For the next  minutes it was pretty even, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan took a chance on the edge of the box but Cathail Arnold easily saved. Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick close to the Ballynagross net, but David Gilmorersquos effort was straight at the goalkeeper.Ballynagross had a chance from a corner but it was well cleared by Castlewellan.Forest striker Shane Mooney found himself booked for his comments to the referee in the rd minute.Castlewellan were very much seeking out a goal to level and it came in the th minute after a scrap for the ball in Ballynagrossrsquo box resulted in Shane Mooney scoring with the last kick of the game to send the tie to extra-time.There were a few chances during extra-time for Ballynagross, although neither team could find a break through to escape the need for penalties. Castlewellan swapped out Brian McVeigh in goal for Sean Dornan.Ballynagrossrsquo Connor Marron, who had already scored a penalty during the game, was first to step up and easily converted.Castlewellanrsquos Shane Mooney and Ballynagrossrsquo Declan Dowie followed and both scored.Forestrsquos new lsquokeeper Dornan came out of the net and rushed his penalty, sending the ball over the bar.John Mahoney made no mistake to give his lsquoGross side a further advantage before Ciaran Stratton kept Castlewellan in with a chance.Ballynagrossrsquo John Shields walked up to take his penalty but the lsquokeeper saved to bring it level again.Eoin Travers converted his penalty and now it was sudden death.Tom McNeill confidentially scored his penalty meaning all of the pressure fell on Castlewellanrsquos Ryan Morgan to keep the game going.However, his effort was saved resulting in Ballynagross progressing to the final.Ballynagross: C Arnold, T McNeill, R Tumelty, C Marron, C Davis, J Polley, J Shields, J Burns, L Shields, P Doran, S McComiskeySubs: D Craig, D Dowie, J Mahoney, K Taggart, A Beattie.Castlewellan Forest: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, J OrsquoNeill, N Travers, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, A Dornan, D Gilmore Subs: S Kinley, G Kidd, E Travers, R Morgan, J Murnin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dismal end to league campaign  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo miserable campaign reached its conclusion as they lost out on home soil to Clare on Sunday.The Mourne side entered this fixture already relegated from Division  and were hoping to gain some,any, momentum ahead of their crucial upcoming Ulster campaign.The uphill task will include having to better Monaghan on May  and then the winner of Cavan and Antrim to make the concluding stage to feature in the All-Ireland series and avoid ato the second-tier championship.Down took to the field in Newry against a Clare side who had endured a mixed bag of results within their league fixtures having won their opening three before losing the next trio of matches.For Down, the loss concludes a point-starved run of fixtures having finished with just one draw and six losses.Clare fielded what appeared to be a physically stronger outfit than their counterparts at Paacuteirc Esler and Downrsquos efforts werenrsquot aided by their lack of discipline.Both Gerard Collins and Pat Havern picked up black cards towards the end of each half while team-mate Finn McElroy picked up a red card with  minutes played.By that stage, the Mourne side didnrsquot appear to be getting anything from the game but that will be little solace to Down boss James McCartan, who has endured a nightmare beginning to his second stint at the helm.Aaron Grfin scored the first goal of the match with nine minutes played, courtesy of a smart left-footed finish which bested Kilcoo-native Niall Kane at his near post.To their credit, Down showed some resilience and managed to notch the next four from five points available with Burren man Liam Kerr kicking over a well-taken score amongst these.However, Clare continued to attack the Down goal and found their second major of the match thanks to Cian OrsquoDearsquos effort.His lowly struck shot took the wind out of Downrsquos sails and the Mourne side entered the break six points adrt at -

ndash The Government is poised to unveil an astonishing pound million scheme to replace the Strangford ferry service with a road tunnel under the lough.The scheme has already been approved at ministerial level and it is believed that the pound million originally intended for the Downpatrick bypass road will be used as start-up capital, with phase top-up grants being sought from the European Community and the Ireland Fund as the scheme progresses.Plans for the mile-long road tunnel have been drawn up by senior consultants engaged by the government and it is believed that the entry points will be manned toll booth terminals in Strangford and Portaferry.The move to replace the ferry service with a tunnel received an extra impetus recently when it was revealed that the ferry service was running at a substantial loss and villagers in Strangford vetoed plans for a new jetty for the vessels.Sources within the government say that the tunnel plan, which has been gathering dust for a number of years, has now been reactivated and local roads bosses intend erting the money intended for Downpatrickrsquos ring road to the scheme before the end of the financial year.Publicly, however, officials are remaining tight-lipped about the project. ldquoThe tunnel plan was first put forward several years ago, but as far as I am aware there are no plans to revive it, said a press office spokesperson.Nevertheless, conservation organisations have been consulted about the possible environmental impact of a tunnel, and a study of its possible effects has been carried out by a university team under the guidance of Prof A Lilo.Prof Lilo told the Recorder: ldquoAs far as I can see, there would be little threat to the loughrsquos balanced ecosystem from a tunnel.There may, however, be an unsightly visual impact created by the large tunnel entrances needed in Strangford and Portaferry.CASTLEWELLAN ndash A new school is to be constructed on the site of the existing St

ndash Teenagers, some as young as , are taking part in open-air drinking parties at secluded parts of Downpatrick it was revealed this week.The youth are paying adults to buy drink for them and then going to quiet parts of the town for their parties, a special meeting was told on Tuesday.The police have raided a number of these gatherings in recent months but the teenagers simply move to a dferent location and continue their drinking sprees.While the problem of underage drinking in Downpatrick has not risen in recent years it is nevertheless sufficiently worrying to prompt a group of local community representatives to get together to discuss ways of tackling the issue.Last week youth workers, headmasters, teachers, publicans and councillors met together under the auspices of the RUCrsquos Community Relations Branch and debated the causes and possible remedies of underage drinking.The end result of the discussion was that public awareness needs to be heightened, while teenagers, and their parents, should be appraised of the dangers of alcohol abuse in the young.Superintendent Ronnie Hawthorne, Downpatrick sub-isional commander explained that the problem is a province-wide concern and is not just confined to Downpatrick.He added that underage drinking is also taking place in other parts of Down District.ldquoThere is a problem throughout Northern Ireland and we cannot stop underage drinkers ourselves, we need the help of the whole community, said Superintendent Hawthorne.ldquoThere are a lot associated problems with underage drinking and we will talk to every interested body in a bid to cope with this matter, he added.The full extend of the problems were highlighted by the youth leader in charge of the Patrician Youth Centre, Siobhan Byrne, who

marked on ordnance survey maps dating from , sketches from the town lands of Slievenisky and Backaderry, through Carrivmoragh mountain and descends towards Leitrim by Heronrsquos Road.Local people claim that the path is very old and was once used to reach a Mass Rock on the Backaderry Mountain and in later times, to give a short-cut to the new church in Leitrim.It is also believed the footpath is part of the old highway system that existed before the road system was introduced, and links into a system of lanes that go to Ballynahinch.The Council first became involved in the matter in August  when the petition was formally presented, and shortly afterwards the council voted overwhelmingly to adopt the pathway, subject to legal opinions.However, for the next  months no progress was made on the matter until the council appointed a countryside officer in August . He prepared a report on the footpath, which came before the council earlier this month when it was decided not to adopt itAfterwards a statement from some of the local people seeking the right-of-way said the footpath passes over land belonging to  dferent families and only one has an objection to the council adopting it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Good Morning Down co","story":"THE head of one of the districtrsquos leading charities is officially stepping down from her role next month.Linda Baker has been Good Morning Downrsquos co-ordinator for the past  years and has watched the organisation mdash which provides a telephone befriending service to elderly and vulnerable people across the district mdash increases its operation considerably.The charity provides a valuable leline service to many people across the district, with its hardworking volunteers in regular contact with those who feel vulnerable or at risk, making telephone calls to members at an agreed time each morning.Linda said the service was especially important during the height of the coronavirus pandemic with the deadly virus unfortunately curtailing get-togethers that were organised for clients.Working in partnership with the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, the South Eastern Trust and the Housing Executive, the charity has also received invaluable support from the Allen Lane Foundation and and Halax Community Foundation.ldquoWhen I joined Good Morning Down there were four volunteers making calls to around  people.

They also cause signicant damage to wildle and the environment.Mourne Heritage Trust staff helped with the response to last weekrsquos wildfires using strimmers to create fire breaks, also helping with a controlled back burn and using its argocat all-terrain vehicle and fogging unit to extinguish one branch of a fire that was threatening some field boundaries.In addition, one of the Trustrsquos teams, along with a firefighter, used this specialist equipment to extinguish the fire at Finlieve near Rostrevor.NI Water has also warned that wildfires can have impact on drinking water supplies.The organisation controls so-called water catchment areas in the Mournes which supply water to all of Northern Ireland. The organisation said while it is working hard to deal with the problem of wildfires, it wants to assure customers that tap water quality is unaffected and is of a very high quality.But NI Water has warned that wildfires within catchments not only pose a terrible risk to all le but can remove the primary layer of vegetation, leaving the burned bare soil exposed to erosion which then makes its way into the reservoirs, from where water is abstracted for treatment to provide drinking water.ldquoThe erosion caused by wildfire increases carbon and other polluting chemicals signicantly in untreated water, with sediment accumulating in streams, lakes and reservoirs, said NI Waterrsquos Rebecca Allen.ldquoThis makes raw water especially dficult and more expensive to treat at our facilities to the stringent standards required by the Drinking Water Regulations. A signicant amount of other work by our water supply colleagues also has to be undertaken at the treatment works to ensure excellent quality drinking water during these times.Rebecca added: ldquoExtra water samples have to be collected and analysed, streams from burned areas need isolated, and other remedial measures must be taken like blocking streams to protect reservoirs.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has praised firefighters, other arms of the emergency services and the Mourne Heritage Trust for their efforts to bring the blaze at the Bloody Bridge under control.He said firefighters in particular were overwhelmed by the support from the community.ldquoI witnessed the devastation of the wildfire first hand which impacted a site that is a protected habitat renowned around the world, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe emergency services, particularly local fire crews, should be commended for the professionalism they displayed when dealing with these incidents. However, malicious fires place a massive strain on very limited resources and as we approach the summer I would urge people to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the PSNI.Cllr Clarke said the damage caused by gorse fires has a lasting impact and that areas of outstanding natural beauty can take years to recover, calling for a co-ordinated response from the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, NI Water, health and public safety departments and the Department of Justice.He continued: ldquoWe need to see a collective response with a sharing of resources and there needs to be additional funding provided to build upon the best practice Mourne Heritage Trust has undertaken to reduce the impact of these fires in the High Mournes. Controlled burns and better land-management needs to be re-established.ldquoMeasures should include the establishment of fire breaks to reduce the fuel load and a cross-departmental strategic response to ensure that the scale of these fires should never happen again.Cllr Clarke said it is important that police proactively investigate what are environmental crimes and those responsible need to be assured that these types of crime will not be tolerated in society.South Down MLA Sinead Ennis has also praised firefighters for their efforts in battling huge fires in the Mournes which started at Hen Mountain and Spelga Dam.She added: ldquoTragically, these fires will have caused widespread damage to the environment and our wildle. This is yet another stark reminder that everyone must behave responsibly while visiting the Mournes in order to protect the environment and the safety of the local community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Reality TV star Matthew visits ex primary school  ","story":"FRESH from Dancing With The Stars Ireland, TV star Matthew MacNabb and his new girlfriend took the chance to visit his former primary school last week.Matthew and his professional dance partner, Laura Nolan, visited St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Legamaddy, after making it to the semi-final of the top RTE show.The visit to the school, which the Downpatrickrsquos manrsquos brother and sisters also attended, coincided with the school celebrating news of receiving a sizeable grant.It has been awarded pound, which will go towards creating a pollinator garden in the school grounds.Pupils were delighted to show Matthew and Laura around the school, particularly its new outdoor learning hub which allows to have an outdoor classroom for eco projects.The schoolrsquos Eco teacher, Mrs Bronagh Reid, said the school was delighted to welcome Matthew back.ldquoHe was very friendly to all the pupils, who found him very inspiring, said Mrs Reid. ldquoIt was good that he called with us on a day off and it was down to his mother Margaret, who sits on our board of governors.ldquoWe were all hoping that Matthew would make into the final but very impressed that he cog to the semi-final.The schoolrsquos cash injection is part of the Rural Community Pollinator Grants Scheme, which is financed by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand managed by the civic-pride campaign, Live Here Love Here.It is designed to allow community groups and schools across rural Northern Ireland to benefit from funding between pound, to pound, to establish, enhance or develop a local community pollinator garden.A pollinator garden is a shared space with pollinating plants, habitats, wildflowers, flowers, shrubs and trees, and the grants support new initiatives aimed at protecting and providing for pollinators.Mrs Sarah McDowell, principal, said: ldquoWe plan to use the money to create an outdoor learning space which will enhance our school grounds and the local community.ldquoWe will build an outdoor classroom and plant fruit trees to attract more wildle to our school grounds.`We are delighted to receive the support of Live Here Love Here to help us create this space which will benefit the children in our school and will help to improve bioersity in the area.She added: ldquoWe look forward to starting to create this area after Christmas and have it ready for the spring term.The pilot scheme, which made pound. million available for  , aims to cover % of costs to community groups and schools wishing to embark on the community environmental project.Successful grant applicants were required to illustrate their plans to maximise pollinator-friendly land-management techniques to increase the bioersity value of an area by planting for pollinators, and to transform unused spaces into valued community spaces, adding habitats and greening-up formerly grey areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Students involved in All Island lights switch off climate event  ","story":"THE lights went out at Stormont at the weekend thanks to ecologically aware local high school studentsA group of pupils from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and Down High School, who are involved in the All-Island Schools  Climate Action programme, asked for the lights at Stormont to be switched off for one hour on Saturday evening.Local MLAs Harry Harvey and Colin McGrath helped ensure that the request was fast-tracked, with Mr Harveyrsquos we, Sharon, doing a lot of the work behind the scenes.Mr Harvey met with staff and pupils from the two schools in the grounds of Parliament Buildings to observe the dimming of the lights.Stormont joined in solidarity with the  countries from around the world that participated in the th anniversary of the global Earth Hour.

Our society has remained the poorer of those failures.”Dr Farren added “Renewing our commitment to building common ground is one of the challenges being addressed by the John  Pat Hume Foundation. Whether it be in our political institutions, or in our economic, social and cultural lives we must create and develop opportunities for partnerships and do so respecting our dferent traditions, identities and political ambitions.“We recognise the key role of the Irish government in implementing the Good Friday and the Taoiseach’s own commitment through the Shared Island initiative. This initiative will afford new opportunities for those who share the aim of building that common ground.”Derry Playhouse chief executive Kevin Murphy said: “A conversation that looks for common ground continues to be of the greatest importance here in Northern Ireland and across our shared islands and shared planet”.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityWe asked the people of Barry and Penarth on their thoughts of the reduction of the summer school holidays from six weeks to three, which could come in under plans to modernise the academic year.The Welsh Government has not said anything on when or how any changes could or would be introduced but it has been greeted with a mixed reaction.Sarah Timmins said: “Don’t confuse school with childcare. Continue with six weeks holiday in the summer at least! We get the shortest summer break in the world. State should provide free affordable childcare.”Trena Wise said: “Four weeks would be better and spread the rest throughout the year.” This was agreed with by Lisa Gerrard.Trudi Thomas said: “Five weeks and an extra week off at Christmas.”Iulia Condurache said: “These kids need this. Where is this obsession to work more is coming from  School is enough, work week is too much. Cut the bloody huge pays, tax the rich properly, educate for sustainability not waste and you will have a balance.”MORE NEWS:Kelly Crowther said: “No. By moving the extra leave to October and December is going to cost me so much more to entertain the kids. At least in the summer we can hopefully enjoy the sunshine and free stuff as parks and beaches.”Lynne Bryan said: “Yes definitely they get to many holidays as it is.”Luna Davies said: “Perhaps four weeks but the last week of school is turned over to fun activities without academic focus. Add the other week in to Christmas. If it comes after Christmas, the kids should have enough to do to entertain themselves.”Paula Chapman said: “Id rather four weeks to be honest. And let the kids have an extra week at Christmas and Easter. Six weeks is just a bit long by week four they are usually bored and craving a bit of normality and routine.”.removeMike Corbridge said: “No... probably parents wish it was shorter. I had six when I was a kid and it wasnt long enough.”Tracy Lewis said: “Yes.... six weeksis way too long. Nobodys gathering the hay on the farm anymore etc needs to be cut back to at most four weeks.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

They also included civets, which along with pangolins have been identied as potential vectors in the spread of diseases such as Sars and Covid-.Shaun Martin, who heads the WWF’s Asia-Pacic regional cybercrime project, said monitoring of the online wildle trade shows dferent species being kept close together, sometimes in the same cage.“With Asia’s track record as a breeding ground for many recent zoonotic diseases, this sharp uptick in online trade of wildle in Myanmar is extremely concerning,” he said. vw,vw,px, px\"One of  tigers cubs seized from smugglers has blood samples taken from veterinary team from the wildle forensic unit to trace the DNA, in Thailand The unregulated trade in wild species and resulting interactions between wild species and humans raise the risks of new and possibly vaccine-resistant mutations of illnesses such as Covid- that could evolve undetected in non-human hosts into more dangerous iants of disease, experts say..removeCovid- is one of many diseases traced back to animals.

portion of the proceeds from the recent sale of the Dunluce Centre in order to upgrade the facilities at Parker Avenue in order to ensure that they are up to a safe and suitable standard for all

This increase will see the yearly gas bill of a typical household with a credit meter rise by about pound per year to pound,. Those customerswith a prepayment gas meterwill see costs increase by around pound per year to pound,. Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “It is important that consumers are made aware that their domestic gas bills will stay high for at least the next year because the wholesale price that the companies pay for the gas continues to be much more expensive than the norm. Unfortunately heating oil prices are also very high, so regardless of the fuel we use, many of us will experience extreme pressure on our household budgets. This will further increase the numbers of people in fuel poverty, as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating. “As the Winter   Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme ends today , we implore firmus energy, and the wider energy industry, to commit to financially supporting the continuation of a fuel hardship scheme in the coming financial year. For the longer term, it is clear that energy companies, policy makers, the Utility Regulator, charities and the Consumer Council must continue to work together to develop sustainable solutions to help support those in need as the problem of high energy prices will likely be with us for the foreseeable future.” Consumers who are struggling to pay their energy bills or struggling to pay to top-up their meter should contact their supplier directly for support. Consumers can also get in touch with the Consumer Council for free, independent advice by calling Freephone    or by emailingcontact@consumercouncil.org.uk.

We told you that the tree used to make ballot paper – Flora Plio – was in short supply. Of course there’s no such thing as a Flora Plio, which is an anagram of April Fool. Our paper production expert, Poppy Cox, was indeed a load of poppycock, and of course we couldn’t do an April Fool about paper without mentioning foolscap. And we had to make our ‘official’ statement at midday because,we hadn’t, we’d be the fools for carrying on!  The forthcoming election is set to be postponed for a fortnight due to insufficient amounts of the correct type of ballot paper, we understand. It is believed that the specic type of tree used to make the paper - Flora Plio – has been in short supply in recent months. Paper production expert, Poppy Cox, explained why this specic type of tree was used for the production of ballot papers. “It has a special waxy quality that prevents the mark you make on your ballot paper being rubbed out,” said Mrs Cox. “That obviously adds an added level of security to the elections and stops people claiming that their ballot has been changed.” Alternatives are now being sought and the two week delay in the vote will hopefully allow for the ballot to be printed on a dferent type of paper. “It is possible that we could see a special kind of foolscap being useda secure alternative can’t be found,” Mrs Cox added.
