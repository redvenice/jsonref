I thought how they would be hurt by my death.\u0027This made me keep going. I had to fight until the very end. I kept trying to overcome my gloomy thoughts.\u0027There was another fear too - sharks or other threats lurking in the deep.\u0027I felt things touching my legs.\u0027I kept assuring myself it was just seaweed, nothing dangerous, that there was nothing down there that could harm me.\u0027I just kept hoping that the right wind would come, or a current would carry me back to the shore.\u0027Her family only realised something was amiss at 7pm when she failed to return from her spa appointment - by then Olga had been in there sea already for four hours.Her belongings including her purse were found on the beach.\u0027This was the start of our nightmare,\u0027 said Yulia, a TV producer.Police came to the hotel and several large boats were sent out.\u0027It was not possible to use small boats near the shore because the weather was bad, it was a storm.\u0027They would use a helicopter to search but only next morning, they were told.Yulia was in panic.

They then went up through Indonesia, around the bottom of India and Africa, before coming to South America in 2016, the Caribbean in 2017, and back to the USA this yearAfter saving and planning, Behan, 48, quit her job at a digital ad agency, Jamie, 52, left his medical equipment distribution business and they took the children out of school.They then loaded their lives onto a 47ft sailboat, which they christened Totem, and set off from Puget Sound, Washington, USA, with $90,000 in the bank.The close-knit clan, from Seattle, WA, have since completed a circumnavigation of the globe, covering 58,253 miles and visiting 48 countries and territories.George Clooney leans on rails for support as he hobbles onto...Share this articleThey\u0027ve battled rough seas, extinguished a fire that threatened to destroy Totem and narrowly missed being hit by an out-of-control powerboat.But Behan said it\u0027s been a \u0027wonderful opportunity to experience the world\u0027 with her children - who now firmly identify as \u0027boat kids\u0027 rather than landlubbers.While 19-year-old Niall will soon be disembarking to attend college, Behan, Jamie and their daughters Mairen, 16, and Siobhan, 14, plan to continue the adventure.Behan, who blogs about their unique lifestyle at sailingtotem.com, said: \u0027We did the stupidest thing in the world and left the perfect life.          The family are pictured in South Africa in 2016. During their voyage, Behan and Jamie estimate they have spent just $300,000, compared to the $1.2million it would have cost them to live in Seattle over ten years          The family look out over the Andaman Sea, off the coast of Myanmar, in 2014          Niall, Mairen and Siobhan are pictured in Mexico, the family\u0027s first destination, in 2008. At the time they were aged just nine, six and four          The family decided to undertake their voyage in 2002 after the birth of Marien and the death of Jamie\u0027s mother coincided. It took them six years to prepare for the trip\u0027We had high-paying jobs, dual income. It was so perfect and white picket fence it was almost painful. It makes your teeth hurt.\u0027Then in a two week spell in 2002, our eldest daughter was born and my husband\u0027s mother passed away. It was hard to see those milestones of life happening together.\u0027My mother-in-law was going to go traveling but she had cancer and literally died within weeks.\u0027It forced us to think about our priorities and what we wanted, and when Jamie and I met this was something we were always going to do.\u0027We had been telling people we were going to take our children on a boat and sail and we didn\u0027t know when we would be coming back, and we got some looks like, You\u0027re crazy.\u0027When we left in 2008, we felt exhilarated and euphoric. I couldn\u0027t believe it. It was something we had worked so long and hard for.\u0027It\u0027s such a crazy, different way of life from the outside. On one hand, we have given up so much to do this but we have zero regrets.\u0027We barely saw each other before and now our family is very tight. We have had the most wonderful opportunity to experience the world with our kids.\u0027While there is no typical day aboard Totem, the Giffords wake up when the sun rises and sleep when it sets, bedding down in one of two cabins on their floating home.Behan and Jamie also homeschool their children, teaching them standard subjects as well as devoting time to cultural immersion and hands-on learning.The kids don\u0027t have mobile phones so there\u0027s no Snapchat or Instagram and they\u0027re \u0027not dialed in to popular culture\u0027, but they spend time relaxing or exploring.They also chip in with chores, including doing laundry without a washing machine, helping maintain the boat and preparing meals.They eat local wherever possible - rice dishes in Mexico roshi flatbreads in the Males - and stock up on vegetables and pasta at markets as well as catching fish.\u0027Before I went cruising, we could load up the minivan with a half dozen bags of groceries and walk them up to the double fridge,\u0027 Behan said.\u0027Now everything I\u0027m finding at markets and carrying it back, but I can only carry so much at a time.          Niall, now 19, is preparing to leave the boat to study French and economics at a college in Washington, but the rest of his family plan to keep going          Niall, Mairen, Siobhan and Jamie are pictured eating in Paupa New Guinea. The family carry few supplies on the boat, instead relying on markets and restaurants in each country          Behan blogs about the family\u0027s experience on board the boat, and says she does not plan to give up the dream lifestyle any time soon\u0027The everyday tasks of life and maintenance take us a lot longer.\u0027The Giffords funded their trip through savings and money they raised during an 18-month stint living on their boat and working jobs on land in Australia.They also freelance on the move and continue to rent out their house in Washington, which covers their mortgage payments, taxes and maintenance.In total they\u0027ve spent around $300,000 in the ten years since they set off. The average cost of living for a family of five in Seattle, their hometown, is around $122,000 per year.The family are currently in the US for the summer but will be back on Totem by October and plan to sail to Mexico for a year and a half before returning to the South Pacific.Despite the fact Niall will be staying behind to study French and economics at college in Portland, Oregon, Behan said the rest of the family have no plans to return for good.She added: \u0027Everybody has to be healthy and happy. At some point my husband or I will keel over or we wouldn\u0027t be able to finance it.\u0027I fully expect it to happen at some point. I just can\u0027t imagine it now.

But this is definitely not the answer the interviewer is looking for.  Therefore it is not the answer you should be giving.If you honestly don\u0027t think you have any weaknesses then you risk coming across as arrogant if you say so – and nobody wants a perfect candidate anyway.          Don\u0027t let it throw you off balance: There are a number of ways to tackle this tricky questionTURN IT ROUND TO YOUR ADVANTAGEWhile this is a somewhat negative question, it is in fact full of opportunities for you to turn it round to your advantage and make your answer a positive point.Don\u0027t be perturbed by the question or let it throw you off balance. Your answer should be right on the tip of your tongue – because we will work on it right now.The first thing to make clear is that you should only ever discuss a \u0027professional\u0027 weakness, unless the interviewer specifically requests otherwise, which is extremely unlikely.In a nutshell, the interviewer wants to know that you are able to look at yourself objectively and criticise yourself where appropriate.TWO CHOICES TO TAKE WHEN ANSWERINGYou don\u0027t just want to come up with a straightforward list of what you consider your weaknesses to be. You basically have two choices:- Talk about a weakness that\u0027s not necessarily a weakness at all.- Talk about a weakness that you turned (or can turn) into a strength.The problem with the first option is that you risk running into serious cliché territory. I\u0027m talking about the kind of people who answer:- I would have to say that my main weakness is that I\u0027m a perfectionist.- I have a reputation for working too hard I often push myself far too hard in my work.You risk sounding like you plucked your answer straight out of a 1990s manual on interview technique.Personally, I prefer the second option: Talk about a weakness that you turned - or are turning - into a strength.You are answering the interviewer\u0027s question by highlighting a definite weakness, but you then go on to reflect positively on this by outlining the active steps you have taken or are taking to overcome it.You are demonstrating a willingness to learn, adapt and improve and that you have the initiative required to make changes where changes are due.Choosing a weakness that has its root in lack of experience and therefore has been (or is being) overcome by further training is ideal because it is a weakness that is relatively easily resolved.      £185 M\u0026S vouchers to switch and stayNo fees to use abroadJames Innes Group of CV Consultants - The James Innes Group"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/12/15/4E27F37000000578-5946461-MailOnline_can_reveal_that_he_ran_the_Mermaid_Fish_Bar_in_North_-a-20_1531404037258.jpg","title":"Rail boss battered ordering commuters class used run fish chip shop","story":"    Rail boss Mark Boon, who was slammed for kicking passengers on a busy train out of first class before spreading across two seats (pictured above), used to run a fish and chip shop, MailOnline can reveal          MailOnline can reveal that he ran the Mermaid Fish Bar in North Finchley (above left) for four years between 2009 and 2013 and was popular locally           Mehrdad Kayedpour, who now runs the chip shop, described how he\u0027d been well loved in the community when he\u0027d run the popular chippy, originally established in 1932 TfL tube strike: All you need to know about the Piccadilly...Rail services return to line axed by Beeching: Firm starts...Share this articleBrought up in Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales, he worked for National Express and TfL before running and owning a \u0027family catering business\u0027, according to his Linkedin profile.He ran the Mermaid Fish Bar for four years between 2009 and 2013.Mehrdad Kayedpour, who now runs the chip shop, described how he\u0027d been well loved in the community when he\u0027d run the popular chippy, originally established in 1932.He said: \u0027He lived in the flat above the shop. I met him a couple of times when we took over the lease from him.\u0027Customers came from all over, from as far afield as Camden, to have his fish and chips. This place was packed out on a Friday.\u0027We still get people coming from miles away now. He was really well liked local businessman around here too.\u0027But he suddenly vanished and no one knew where he went on to. We all thought he was working for London Underground.\u0027          Mr Kayedpour said customers came from all over north London to have Mr Boon\u0027s fish and chips          In an article for local newspaper The Archer in 2011, Mr Boon said his favourite part of running a north London family chip shop was \u0027getting to know his customers\u0027In an article for local newspaper The Archer in 2011, Mr Boon said his favourite part of running a north London family chip shop was \u0027getting to know his customers\u0027.His father and grandfather both worked in the same line of business in south Wales, the article said. \u0027What I like about the business is that I\u0027m my own boss and I can get to know the customers. We have a lot of local trade and customers come from as far as Mill Hill and Muswell Hill.\u0027My parents were up visiting a few weeks ago and they\u0027re very proud of what we\u0027ve done here.\u0027 The article was published after his shop was awarded five stars by the Food Standards Agency and he won the Frymax Gold Standard Award for food quality.The furore over the train seats began when Ms Fitzpatrick, from Croydon, South London, said she joined the train mid-route before it terminated at London Victoria.The 33-year-old said that Mr Boon had a \u0027really awful manner\u0027 as he \u0027dismissively\u0027 turned passengers away from approximately 10 empty first-class seats on the train.    Earlier this week, a photo of Mr Boon posted by hairdresser Emma Fitzpatrick showing him then taking up two seats in first class - including one for his bag and jacket - went viral online, prompting  fury          Emma FitzPatrick tweeted this message with the photo after being shocked by his actionsShe confronted him about his behaviour as the train pulled into London Victoria, telling him: \u0027I can\u0027t believe what you\u0027ve done today. You should be hanging your head in shame.\u0027 Ms Fitzpatrick claims Mr Boon handed his business card out to passengers as he turned them away.Sharing the photo on Twitter, Emma wrote: \u0027Totally shocked to see Govia Railway Head of Operations, Mark Boon, telling all commuters to stay out of an EMPTY First Class carriage on a LATE \u0026amp very packed train this morning. Meanwhile he took up two seats in there.\u0027She continued: \u0027It was a London bound Southern Train that arrived into London Victoria at approx 11.45am this morning.\u0027I still can\u0027t believe it. He even handed his business card out to the people that he was turning away! Talk about rubbing salt into commuters\u0027 wounds.\u0027Describing her experience on the train, she added: \u0027I saw First Class had just two men sat in there, so lots of spare seats - around eight or 10 available. So I started squeezing past those stood up, to go and sit in there.\u0027But then a lady told me the man there - pointing at Mark Boon, had told her not to sit in there as she had gone to sit down.\u0027I couldn\u0027t believe it. Then she showed me the business card he had given her. I said, \u0027You must be joking\u0027, but another female passenger nodded and said he had said the same to her.\u0027          Commuters on the line have experienced horrific conditions and delays in recent years          The franchise has been repeatedly criticised over the conditions on its trains. Pictured: 2017Ms Fitzpatrick said she made her way to the first class compartment - where Mr Boon glanced at her and immediately told her the same thing.\u0027He didn\u0027t even ask if I had a First Class ticket - he just looked at me and assumed I didn\u0027t,\u0027 she said.\u0027He told me the carriage was for First Class passengers only. I was so shocked.\u0027I told him I was feeling a little unwell so I needed a seat, but he dismissively said to go and get some water or something, and looked back down at his phone.\u0027I told him I would sit down on the arm of a chair, so as to keep the First Class seats free.\u0027I was just blown away looking back at the men and women packed in down the train.\u0027 Within 24 hours of sharing the photo, Emma\u0027s Tweet had been shared hundreds of times - with outraged Twitter users sharing their disdain.A Govia Thameslink spokesman said: \u0027Passengers need a first class ticket to travel in first class and there were other people with first class tickets in this compartment.\u0027This was an 11am off-peak service running just six minutes late and, while the front coaches were busy, there were seats and space in the rear coaches, as Mr Boon explained.\u0027       "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/12/16/4E2A688900000578-5946491-image-m-83_1531409213801.jpg","title":"Juncker struggles gala leaders step help","story":"    Jean Claude-Juncker bumps into the Presidents of Ukraine and Finland as a group of world leaders make their way to a gala dinner          Juncker took a remarkably long time to descend from a podium after a photoshoot with the other world leaders      ¿I¿m a stable genius¿: Trump declares victory in battle with...May warns Trump not to split NATO by appeasing Putin as she...Trump resumes his attack on FBI lovers en route to second...Share this articleJean-Claude Juncker addresses the media after the signature of the second EU NATO Joint Declaration on Tuesday            Delegations arrive for a working session of NATO leaders and the delegations from Ukraine and Georgia          President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel during their bilateral meeting, Wednesday, July 11, 2018 in Brussels, BelgiumTrump created tension with Chancellor Angela Merkel after publicly berating Germany for its new Nord Stream 2 pipeline agreement with Russia.\u0027Germany is totally controlled by Russia,\u0027 Trump said. \u0027I think its a very bad thing for NATO,\u0027 Trump said.Several EU leaders, including Juncker were quick to kowtow to the President\u0027s demands, saying the EU must \u0027take responsibility\u0027 for its security.In a statement on Tuesday Juncker said: \u0027Europe has decided to take responsibility for its own security.\u0027NATO is a cornerstone of that strategy and we are working full steam to implement the 74 joint actions which go from countering hybrid threats to cyber security, defence and research.\u0027This partnership is a cornerstone of our overall security and defence strategy.

Australasian Olympic Team at Stockholm Roddforening includes Fanny Durack and Mina WylieAfter some fundraising efforts by supporters, Fanny was able to travel to London and then Stockholm where she became one of two Australian gold medallists following her 100 meters freestyle win. Her friend Mina won the silver.Fanny was then recognised as a national heroine, went on to tour the US and promote swimming more than any woman, apart from her fellow Australian Annette Kellerman. Between 1912 and 1918, she broke 12 world records before retiring and marrying Bernard Gately.She coached juniors and became a member of the organisation that had at first prevented her from competing, which was renamed the New South Wales Women’s Amateur Swimming Association. Fanny died in 1956.What is a Google Doodle?Sarah ‘Fanny’ Durack has been celebrated in the Google Doodle for July 12, 2018 and to this day, her name lives on because of her commitment to gender equality in sports.

(File photo)Government figures do show that the number of children born to non-UK born women increased by around 75 per cent between 2002 and 2013 - children born in these years are currently in school.This was a period of increased births overall.The DfE also gave a number of scenarios which could affect overall pupil numbers.For example, if there was high net migration, total pupil numbers (nursery, primary and secondary) could be 48,000 higher than projected by 2027 and if there was low net migration, they would be 48,000 lower.And if there were high fertility rates, numbers could be 95,000 higher and if fertility rates were low, they would be around 133,000 lower. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/12/21/4E2BDF6C00000578-0-image-a-2_1531426286920.jpg","title":"Woman 30 donate eggs women doesnt want contact biological children","story":"    Kerri Middleton  has been chronicling her decision to become an egg donor on TwitterFor 30-year-old Kerri’s joy was not for her own future, but for that of a woman she has never met. Because, just under a year ago, she became an egg donor, an act of pure altruism to help a childless couple be given the joy of parenthood.What’s more, she did it not as well as, but instead of, having children of her own.‘I’m not really very maternal at all — I have no real desire to have children,’ she says. ‘My two best friends have had babies and, while I am really happy for them, and the babies are gorgeous, the moment they start crying, I just want to get out of there.‘I love my career and I just don’t see children in my future. So, for me, this was a way I could help someone else have a child without having one myself. That’s actually what made it attractive to me.’It’s a laudable instinct and one that Kerri believes should be more widely shared — one reason she set up a no-holds-barred Twitter account for the duration of her egg donation journey, documenting the injections, the scans and the physical changes she underwent on her three-month egg donor ‘journey’.Every painful needle and mottled bruise, every stomach cramp and hormone surge are all carefully photographed and honestly described. It’s not easy reading, and certainly not for the squeamish, but it prompts the very obvious question: what drives a healthy, fertile young woman to put herself through this physical discomfort and mental uncertainty without the reward of a baby of her own at the end?It certainly isn’t money: in the UK, egg donors cannot be paid, although they can receive up to £750 compensation per donation cycle to cover their travel, accommodation or childcare costs. So, what was it?‘I had friends who were struggling to conceive and I had seen first-hand how desperate they were to have a child,’ says Kerri.‘My father also works as a foster carer and seeing what he does is a constant reminder of the unfairness of the world: so many people would give everything they had to have a baby, yet can’t have them — while others have them and don’t deserve them.’           Kerri Middleton was thrilled when she found out a woman she had never met was going to have a baby using eggs she donated to herKerri was also determined to spread the word on how women like her — fertile, but without maternal instincts — could help.‘When I was researching egg donation, there was lots of medical stuff to read up on, but not much from people who had actually done it,’ she says. ‘I thought the blog might be helpful — and, if it gets just one more woman to think about donating her eggs, then it has achieved something good.’There’s certainly no shortage of demand — a demand that continues to grow as more women and couples are deciding to start a family later in life, before discovering that it’s not plain sailing.The latest figures in the UK show that 3,924 babies were born from egg donors in 2016, almost double the number ten years earlier.Demand, however, is not matched by supply: the shortage of donor eggs has been described as ‘critical’ with many women travelling abroad in order to fulfil their dream of motherhood — leaving clinics to rely on emotion-tugging adverts to entice prospective donors.Kerri spotted just such an advert early last year while travelling on the underground in London, where she was then working.At the time Kerri, who grew up the middle child of three in Bournemouth, had a well-paid job in sales for a medical supply company, and motherhood could not have been further from her mind.Yet something about the picture of a smiling baby caught her eye. ‘Alongside it was a question about whether you had considered egg donation,’ she recalls.‘I’d never even heard of it but I was curious and it played on my mind so I did some research, read around it and the more I read the more I wanted to do something about it so I contacted the clinic and made an appointment.’And so, in early March, Kerri arrived at a small private clinic in central London for a 40-minute initial appointment.          The latest figures in the UK show that 3,924 babies were born from egg donors in 2016‘There was a lot of paperwork, mostly about my health and any family illnesses — which happily we don’t have. They also explained the risks and they then gave me some paperwork to look over but by then I had already made up my mind,’ she recalls.While the health risks of donating eggs appear to be few, there is a risk of ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome (OHSS), a rare but potentially severe condition that occurs when fertility medication causes too many eggs to develop in the ovaries. If not treated in time it can prove fatal.‘My view was that the risks were small — obviously with anything of this nature there is going to be some risk, but it was a calculated one.’Initially, Kerri told no one about her plans, but eventually mentioned it to a flatmate. ‘She’s very sensible — she was the one who said I needed to talk to my parents,’ she says. ‘I actually hadn’t thought about it but she was right.‘They didn’t really say much. I think they were a bit surprised but they were supportive and knew me too well to try to talk me out of it.’Over the coming days and weeks Kerri confided in other friends and colleagues. ‘Most people were fine but I was surprised by the lack of understanding around it. Some friends asked if it meant I would never be able to have kids of my own and one person asked if it meant I would go through menopause early.‘It was amazing the amount of women who didn’t even understand what happens in their own body.’The more negative reactions came from some male friends. ‘Some seemed freaked out by it. I don’t know if it was because they felt threatened by it in some way.’Because the start of the process has to be carefully timed to coincide with the start of her menstrual cycle it was not until June that Kerri —who had also received a counselling session from the clinic to ensure she was psychologically prepared — returned to start the process in earnest, receiving the kit she would need for ten days of daily injections to do at home that would stimulate her ovaries to release more eggs.‘It was actually harder than I’d been prepared for,’ she admits. ‘The way the injection was described I thought it would be a pinprick but in fact it’s a two-inch needle. I’m not good with needles at the best of times but I knew it was something I had to just get on with.’Aside from the briefly unpleasant nature of the injections, Kerri said she had few side-effects other than mild period pain, bloating and headaches.Every three days, meanwhile, she had to go to the clinic for an internal scan to check that everything was happening as it should.‘Obviously it wasn’t always convenient but then I would be in the waiting room and I would watch some lovely couple filling in paperwork and it would be a reminder of what it was all about,’ she says.Woman, 25, WINS fight to use sperm harvested from her dead...More women over 50 are choosing to have babies later as...Boys born to women who delay motherhood to put careers first...Share this articleTen days in, a scan revealed that Kerri was successfully growing healthy egg sacks, which meant she could now undergo surgery to harvest her eggs — a procedure preceded by one rather more unpleasant injection.‘I had to inject myself once a few days before surgery with what felt like a huge needle,’ she says. ‘It actually made me feel a bit sick and it took me 40 minutes to pluck up the courage to do it.’The ten-minute removal procedure under general anaesthetic took place at a clinic on London’s Harley Street on July 4 last year and Kerri admits that she had underestimated quite how daunting it would feel.‘I had felt pretty ropey in the days running up to surgery — very tired, and with really bad bloating,’ she recalls. ‘I had never had a general anaesthetic before and I think it just suddenly hit me what was happening. I did have a little cry.‘More than anything I was just anxious that they would actually recover some eggs — even if everything has been going well up to that point there are no guarantees and it would have felt awful if it was all for nothing.’In fact, she woke in the recovery room to news that doctors had harvested 16 healthy eggs. ‘I was buzzing,’ she says.‘I had honestly never felt so proud of myself. It felt so good that I had another little cry.’Sent home with what she calls a ‘mass’ of paperwork it took two days for the dizzy spells and soreness that were a consequence of the surgery to die down. ‘I had been prepared for that so although it wasn’t great it didn’t bother me,’ she says. ‘I just felt I’d done a really good thing.’Her euphoria was not to last: two weeks later she received a call from the clinic asking if she could go in to see them. ‘I wasn’t sure what to expect but when I got there I was told that half my eggs had been given to a private buyer,’ she says.‘It was a woman who didn’t live in the UK but she had bought the eggs and fertilised them with sperm she had also bought separately. Apparently the sperm was infected and the eggs had all been killed. The reason they had called me in was to ask if I would donate again.’          Kerry endured daily injections and painful operations to donate her eggs to other womenThe answer was a robust no.‘I felt pretty angry and upset, like it was a misuse of my eggs,’ she says now. ‘I understood that you don’t get a say in where your eggs go but it felt like this woman was playing God.’There were some happier tidings: the remaining eight eggs had been given to an infertile couple who had been referred to the clinic by the NHS.‘I said that I would be happy to donate again in future if all my eggs were used and they wanted a biological sibling for any baby they had.’ Kerri heard nothing further until, in April, she learned that there was a ‘live pregnancy’ from her donation.She will, subsequently, be told the date of birth and the sex.‘I was thrilled,’ she recalls. ‘I knew how excited this unknown woman must be, that she would have been on the most enormous rollercoaster to get to the point where she was carrying a baby in her tummy.‘I felt nothing but happiness for her.’ Not so her mother, however.It was at this point, with a biological grandchild growing somewhere, that Kerri’s ‘gift’ started to feel real.‘I think it did make her see things differently,’ Kerry acknowledges.‘For the first time she said she felt a bit funny about the fact that she will have a grandchild out there she may never meet.’          A pictures of a scan showing Kerri\u0027s eggs which she goes through daily injections so she can donate themBut from Kerri? Nothing else? Not a twinge of curiosity, or a pang of longing for a child that is genetically at least, half hers? Not at all, she insists.‘Whether it’s a boy or a girl makes no difference to me’ she says.‘I don’t feel it’s my baby. The way I see it is that there was a couple who desperately wanted to get to an airport to go on holiday but they couldn’t find a car to take them there. I provided the car.‘So I helped them to their destination but their life there is nothing to do with me.’ The baby, of course, may see it differently: since the law changed in 2005 all donors in the UK are required to sign a register containing their contact details and babies born as a result of egg donation are allowed to access information about their donor when they turn 18.It means that some day, nearly two decades from now, Kerri may receive an email, or a knock at the door, from her biological son or daughter. ‘I am open to that but it is not something I worry about either,’ she says. It will, of course, be fascinating to see if she feels the same way in five years time — or if it impacts on future relationships.Currently single, might a future partner find it hard to accept that his girlfriend’s offspring is out there somewhere unknown to her.‘I actually don’t worry about that — for me I think the bigger conversation is the fact I don’t want children,’ she says.‘It’s a hard conversation to have.‘All I know is that there are women out there right now who are yearning to carry their own baby. I’m not one of them — but I have helped someone who couldn’t’.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/13/01/4E2DEEC300000578-0-image-a-5_1531440392606.jpg","title":"Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich puts UK visa worries aside kits 30m London penthouse","story":"    Abramovich has bagged the penthouse at this Chelsea Waterfront development for £30million          The Chelsea owner\u0027s apartment is the biggest of 75 in the development and he has a team of interior designers fitting it out The 51-year-old is said to have given up on the application and obtained an Israeli passport that allows short trips to London despite having no visa, The Times reports.  Father-of-seven Abramovich was the first big Russian name to withdraw his investments in Britain as tensions between President Putin and Theresa May\u0027s government worsened.Plans for a £1billion redevelopment of Chelsea\u0027s ground were halted last month as the club cited the \u0027current unfavourable investment climate\u0027.

I thought how they would be hurt by my death.\u0027This made me keep going. I had to fight until the very end. I kept trying to overcome my gloomy thoughts.\u0027There was another fear too - sharks or other threats lurking in the deep.\u0027I felt things touching my legs.\u0027I kept assuring myself it was just seaweed, nothing dangerous, that there was nothing down there that could harm me.\u0027I just kept hoping that the right wind would come, or a current would carry me back to the shore.\u0027Her family only realised something was amiss at 7pm when she failed to return from her spa appointment - by then Olga had been in there sea already for four hours.Her belongings including her purse were found on the beach.\u0027This was the start of our nightmare,\u0027 said Yulia, a TV producer.Police came to the hotel and several large boats were sent out.\u0027It was not possible to use small boats near the shore because the weather was bad, it was a storm.\u0027They would use a helicopter to search but only next morning, they were told.Yulia was in panic.          Russian tourist Olga Kuldo (pictured) has been found \u0027fried\u0027 but alive after being stranded on an inflatable sunbed for 21 hours when it floated out to sea off Crete          Medic Olga Kuldo, from Zelenograd, Russia, was swept out to sea at the resort of Rethymno on the north of the Greek island after being caught in a strong current\u0027We were told to wait, to calm down,\u0027 she said, reliving the horror.\u0027But I kept asking questions, and the statistics was not encouraging – 10 to 20 tourists die in the sea at Crete each year.\u0027She found herself asking morbid questions.\u0027I asked how often they find people or their bodies, or do people just go missing and it ends with nothing…?\u0027I wanted to know how quickly a dead body would come to the surface…\u0027She and her father couldn\u0027t sleep. \u0027They were searching for her body,\u0027 admitted Yulia.\u0027No-one believed she could survive.Yet as dawn broke Olga had survived the storm, and she congratulated herself on reaching her 55th birthday.  Luckily for Olga, a Frontex plane - which patrols the external borders of the European Union monitoring for illegal immigrants spotted her the next morning and a boat soon arrived to pick her up.The Russian woman was seven miles out to sea when she was found, it was reported. She had suffered hypothermia and dehydration and the skin on her back was badly burned\u0027. Olga was kept in hospital for 24 hours, then discharged.The family had planned a day-trip for Olga to Santorini as her birthday present and made their delayed trip  before flying back to their home in Zelenograd, near Moscow.\u0027All of us are finally recovering now,\u0027 said Yulia.      Dramatic images show her desperately grappling with the float as Frontex workers throw her a rope to climb onto their vessel.     Frontex told The Sun in a statement: \u0027On 28 June in the morning, a Slovak patrol plane deployed by Frontex in Greece was involved in a Search and Rescue operation when the Hellenic Coast Guard requested our plane to search for a missing person in the sea above Rethymno, Crete.          Family members alerted rescuers after the medic (pictured) failed to return to her hotel room after a late afternoon swim.\u0027At 10.40 our aircraft located the missing person, floating on an air mattress, nine nautical miles from Rethymno and one nautical mile from the coastline close to Lavris.\u0027A Hellenic Coast Guard vessel was dispatched and rescued the 55 year old female who had been in the sea for about 20 hours \u0027Mrs Kuldo needed hospital treatment for exposure and resulting heart problems.  Her relieved daughter Yulia posted on social media: \u0027Miracles happen.\u0027She said her mother, an ultrasound diagnostics doctor, had been \u0027burned to ashes\u0027 by the daytime sun before the EU Frontex agency plane spotted her.A local report on the island said she was on her sunbed \u0027when she was carried away to the open sea so she could not be seen from the beach\u0027.It is unclear if she fell asleep but reports say she was carried away by a \u0027strong current\u0027. Local reports described Olga as \u0027lucky\u0027 to survive.The main damage to her health was from a cold night after she was wet for hours clinging to the air bed.\u0027She stayed alive despite a cold night, strong wind, occasional rain and even a small thunder storm,\u0027 reported neakriti.gr\u0027Her body temperature was as low as 32 C degrees\u0027 (normal is 37C) - causing hypothermia, it was reported.\u0027The tears of her family turned to incredible happiness.\u0027Day time temperatures can reach 35C, while at night they can drop to 18C - not cold but Olga had been hours in the water during the long night. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/12/08/4E26E32200000578-0-image-a-8_1531382350516.jpg","title":"British man survives seventh floor plunge Mallorca hotel balcony","story":"    A British man has survived after plunging from a seventh-floor balcony at a Mallorca hotel and landing on a car (pictured) following a row with his girlfriendInitial reports say the British man fell from a balcony at about 2am. No details have been confirmed, but he is understood to be about 30 years old, Diario de Mallorca reports. Doctors say it is \u0027a miracle\u0027 that he survived because he fell on to the bonnet of the car which was softer than if he had fallen on its roof.British mother dies in Turkish balcony plunge while on...¿We¿re very glad we got you out alive¿: British cave heroes...Share this articleAn emergency call was made to the 061 service which sent several ambulances and the police to the scene. The hotel is situated off a roundabout at the entrance to Porto Cristo.            The incident happened early on Thursday morning at a hotel in the holiday resort of Porto Cristo (file photo)The man jumped from the balcony during an argument with his partner, Spanish newspaper Ultimahora.es reports.It claims the hotel had experienced \u0027problems\u0027 involving the man and woman the previous day.Police have opened an investigation to determine what happened. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/26/14/499AB2AB00000578-0-image-m-9_1519655967278.jpg","title":"How answer whats biggest weakness job interview","story":"    Difficult: Many interviewees know the question might be coming - but can often find it incredibly hard to answer coherently However, interviewers are looking to see how you handle the pressure of this broad question – and a solid answer could help you stand out from the other candidates.In the latest This is Money interview cheat sheet, we ask an expert for his advice on how to answer and also the right way to approach the opposite end of the question – what is your biggest strength.James Innes, who offers CV services and has written a number of books on all aspects of the employment search, reveals all below...\u0027So, tell me about yourself\u0027: Experts reveal their top tips...How to nail a job interview outside the office comfort zone:...It\u0027s a no brainer ¿ let\u0027s just touch base and punch a puppy:...Youngest boss of a British public company took JUST two...Share this articleTHREE KEY REASONS FOR WEAKNESS QUESTIONWith a question like \u0027what are you weaknesses\u0027 the interviewer wants to achieve the following three things:Identify any weakness which might actually be detrimental to your ability to undertake the role.See how you react when faced with a somewhat tricky question.Assess how self-aware you are and how you define weakness.Bear this in mind when it comes to answering - it is always handy to know what the interviewer is trying establish in order to tackle the problem head on.ARROGANT TO SAY \u0027NO\u0027 WEAKNESSESThere is the temptation to say you quite simply don\u0027t have any weaknesses. But this is definitely not the answer the interviewer is looking for.  Therefore it is not the answer you should be giving.If you honestly don\u0027t think you have any weaknesses then you risk coming across as arrogant if you say so – and nobody wants a perfect candidate anyway.          Don\u0027t let it throw you off balance: There are a number of ways to tackle this tricky questionTURN IT ROUND TO YOUR ADVANTAGEWhile this is a somewhat negative question, it is in fact full of opportunities for you to turn it round to your advantage and make your answer a positive point.Don\u0027t be perturbed by the question or let it throw you off balance. Your answer should be right on the tip of your tongue – because we will work on it right now.The first thing to make clear is that you should only ever discuss a \u0027professional\u0027 weakness, unless the interviewer specifically requests otherwise, which is extremely unlikely.In a nutshell, the interviewer wants to know that you are able to look at yourself objectively and criticise yourself where appropriate.TWO CHOICES TO TAKE WHEN ANSWERINGYou don\u0027t just want to come up with a straightforward list of what you consider your weaknesses to be. You basically have two choices:- Talk about a weakness that\u0027s not necessarily a weakness at all.- Talk about a weakness that you turned (or can turn) into a strength.The problem with the first option is that you risk running into serious cliché territory. I\u0027m talking about the kind of people who answer:- I would have to say that my main weakness is that I\u0027m a perfectionist.- I have a reputation for working too hard I often push myself far too hard in my work.You risk sounding like you plucked your answer straight out of a 1990s manual on interview technique.Personally, I prefer the second option: Talk about a weakness that you turned - or are turning - into a strength.You are answering the interviewer\u0027s question by highlighting a definite weakness, but you then go on to reflect positively on this by outlining the active steps you have taken or are taking to overcome it.You are demonstrating a willingness to learn, adapt and improve and that you have the initiative required to make changes where changes are due.Choosing a weakness that has its root in lack of experience and therefore has been (or is being) overcome by further training is ideal because it is a weakness that is relatively easily resolved.      £185 M\u0026S vouchers to switch and stayNo fees to use abroadJames Innes Group of CV Consultants - The James Innes Group"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/12/15/4E27F37000000578-5946461-MailOnline_can_reveal_that_he_ran_the_Mermaid_Fish_Bar_in_North_-a-20_1531404037258.jpg","title":"Rail boss battered ordering commuters class used run fish chip shop","story":"    Rail boss Mark Boon, who was slammed for kicking passengers on a busy train out of first class before spreading across two seats (pictured above), used to run a fish and chip shop, MailOnline can reveal          MailOnline can reveal that he ran the Mermaid Fish Bar in North Finchley (above left) for four years between 2009 and 2013 and was popular locally           Mehrdad Kayedpour, who now runs the chip shop, described how he\u0027d been well loved in the community when he\u0027d run the popular chippy, originally established in 1932 TfL tube strike: All you need to know about the Piccadilly...Rail services return to line axed by Beeching: Firm starts...Share this articleBrought up in Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales, he worked for National Express and TfL before running and owning a \u0027family catering business\u0027, according to his Linkedin profile.He ran the Mermaid Fish Bar for four years between 2009 and 2013.Mehrdad Kayedpour, who now runs the chip shop, described how he\u0027d been well loved in the community when he\u0027d run the popular chippy, originally established in 1932.He said: \u0027He lived in the flat above the shop. I met him a couple of times when we took over the lease from him.\u0027Customers came from all over, from as far afield as Camden, to have his fish and chips. This place was packed out on a Friday.\u0027We still get people coming from miles away now. He was really well liked local businessman around here too.\u0027But he suddenly vanished and no one knew where he went on to. We all thought he was working for London Underground.\u0027          Mr Kayedpour said customers came from all over north London to have Mr Boon\u0027s fish and chips          In an article for local newspaper The Archer in 2011, Mr Boon said his favourite part of running a north London family chip shop was \u0027getting to know his customers\u0027In an article for local newspaper The Archer in 2011, Mr Boon said his favourite part of running a north London family chip shop was \u0027getting to know his customers\u0027.His father and grandfather both worked in the same line of business in south Wales, the article said. \u0027What I like about the business is that I\u0027m my own boss and I can get to know the customers. We have a lot of local trade and customers come from as far as Mill Hill and Muswell Hill.\u0027My parents were up visiting a few weeks ago and they\u0027re very proud of what we\u0027ve done here.\u0027 The article was published after his shop was awarded five stars by the Food Standards Agency and he won the Frymax Gold Standard Award for food quality.The furore over the train seats began when Ms Fitzpatrick, from Croydon, South London, said she joined the train mid-route before it terminated at London Victoria.The 33-year-old said that Mr Boon had a \u0027really awful manner\u0027 as he \u0027dismissively\u0027 turned passengers away from approximately 10 empty first-class seats on the train.    Earlier this week, a photo of Mr Boon posted by hairdresser Emma Fitzpatrick showing him then taking up two seats in first class - including one for his bag and jacket - went viral online, prompting  fury          Emma FitzPatrick tweeted this message with the photo after being shocked by his actionsShe confronted him about his behaviour as the train pulled into London Victoria, telling him: \u0027I can\u0027t believe what you\u0027ve done today. You should be hanging your head in shame.\u0027 Ms Fitzpatrick claims Mr Boon handed his business card out to passengers as he turned them away.Sharing the photo on Twitter, Emma wrote: \u0027Totally shocked to see Govia Railway Head of Operations, Mark Boon, telling all commuters to stay out of an EMPTY First Class carriage on a LATE \u0026amp very packed train this morning. Meanwhile he took up two seats in there.\u0027She continued: \u0027It was a London bound Southern Train that arrived into London Victoria at approx 11.45am this morning.\u0027I still can\u0027t believe it. He even handed his business card out to the people that he was turning away! Talk about rubbing salt into commuters\u0027 wounds.\u0027Describing her experience on the train, she added: \u0027I saw First Class had just two men sat in there, so lots of spare seats - around eight or 10 available. So I started squeezing past those stood up, to go and sit in there.\u0027But then a lady told me the man there - pointing at Mark Boon, had told her not to sit in there as she had gone to sit down.\u0027I couldn\u0027t believe it. Then she showed me the business card he had given her. I said, \u0027You must be joking\u0027, but another female passenger nodded and said he had said the same to her.\u0027          Commuters on the line have experienced horrific conditions and delays in recent years          The franchise has been repeatedly criticised over the conditions on its trains. Pictured: 2017Ms Fitzpatrick said she made her way to the first class compartment - where Mr Boon glanced at her and immediately told her the same thing.\u0027He didn\u0027t even ask if I had a First Class ticket - he just looked at me and assumed I didn\u0027t,\u0027 she said.\u0027He told me the carriage was for First Class passengers only.

For Barthes the race, which set off from the village of Noirmoutier-en-l’Île in north-west France last Saturday, traversed “a veritable Homeric geography”, providing a way to map a nation and celebrate the heroic tenacity of those who cycled through it.Books about racing have tended to focus of the physical suffering endured by the long-distance road cyclist (and often on their chemical aids). As early as 1902 the experimental playwright and novelist Alfred Jarry, who scandalised French literary society by wearing his cycling outfit to the poet Stéphane Mallarmé’s funeral, described the way in which competitive cycling reduced riders to machines. His absurdist, whimsical novella The Supermale describes a race between a group of cyclists and a train. The riders are fuelled by a cocktail of drugs and one dies during the race but, being legally contracted to finish it, his body is obliged to carry on cycling.The finest account of the introverted suffering of bicycle racing – and one of the greatest sporting novels ever written – is the Dutch novelist Tim Krabbé’s The Rider, a first-person description of a semi-professional, one-day race, recounted kilometre by kilometre. Krabbé is a cyclist and also a championship chess player, and he’s exceptionally good on the tactics and mind games involved. In The Rider the race becomes a duel between the narrator and another rider. It’s also a book about obsession. “Non-racers,” the narrator thinks, as he surveys the crowd of race spectators. “The emptiness of those lives shocks me.”At its best cycling, like bicycle writing, provides a way of encountering familiar places in new and surprising ways. “It is by riding a bicycle that you learn the contours of a country best,” wrote Ernest Hemingway, “since you have to sweat up the hills and coast down them.” Two of the best books to celebrate this kind of discovery are Dervla Murphy’s Full Tilt: Ireland to India With a Bicycle, her classic account of a ride undertaken in 1963, armed with her bicycle, named Roz, and a pistol and Emily Chappell’s What Goes Around.Chappell’s book is a memoir of the years she worked as a bicycle courier, a difficult and dangerous job often thought to be dominated by men. She writes beautifully about the freedom provided by cycling and the way in which riding a bike allowed her to rediscover both the London she thought she knew, and also herself.While not a sports writer, the historian Graham Robb conducts much of his research from the saddle. His Cols and Passes of the British Isles is a loving, obsessive almanac of the 2,002 true cols (the lowest point between two mountains) and 105 passes in the UK. In The Discovery of France he pedalled across “l’Hexagone”, sticking to the backstreets and cobbled country roads that he would have missed had he driven. “A bicycle,” he writes in his warm, rich and fascinating book, “unrolls a 360- degree panorama of the land, allows the rider to register its gradual changes … and makes it hard to miss a single inch of it, from the tyre lacerating suburbs of Paris to the Mistral-blasted plains of Provence.” If only the riders of the Tour have time to notice.• Jon Day’s Cyclogeography: Journeys of a London Bicycle Courier is published by Notting Hill Editions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95909f403a40b7c6704e78f30144e800d0704477/16_133_2069_1242/master/2069.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6088079e29d0c30a31e22a262bcd841","title":"uk to pass 1000 hours without coal as energy shift accelerates","story":"Revival of last eight coal plants when ‘beast from the east’ hit Britain proved to be briefBritain has been powered for more than a thousand hours without coal this year, in a new milestone underscoring how the polluting fuel’s decline is accelerating.The UK’s last eight coal power plants staged a brief revival when the “beast from the east” pushed up gas prices earlier this year, causing coal plants to fire up.However, the blip proved short-lived and immaterial, figures compiled by MyGridGB show. The country passed the threshold of 1,000 coal-free hours in the early hours of Friday.The pace of coal power’s demise is speeding up. Throughout the whole of 2017 there were 624 coal-free hours, up from 210 hours in 2016.Andrew Crossland, an energy expert who runs the MyGridGB site, said: “In 2018, Britain saved its coal use for when it needed it most – during the March cold snap. The decline will deepen in the second half of this year, with the planned closure in September of a Yorkshire coal plant and one in Northern Ireland. After Eggborough and Kilroot cease generating there will be six coal plants left.For the first time since the industrial revolution, the UK went a day without coal last year, followed this year by three days in a row.Coal’s fortunes have been in contrast to a series of record highs for renewable sources of energy, including wind, solar and biomass.The recent weeks of sunny weather have also created a series of solar records. The most recent was a new high for solar output over a month, with 1.94 terawatt hours of power generated between 10 June and 9 July, beating the previous record of 1.77TWh.Alastair Buckley, a solar expert at the University of Sheffield, said: “Some of this increase is due to more solar having been installed since 2017 but most of the increase is climatic, with summer 2018 being the fifth sunniest on record so far. “These figures highlight the growing importance of solar energy as a low-carbon and low-cost source of electricity.”Ministers have pledged to phase out coal entirely by 2025 but generation will dwindle well before then. The government’s own projections forecast the amount of power from coal plants between 2019 and 2025 being less than was produced in 2015 alone, Friends of the Earth pointed out.Cottam in Nottinghamshire and Fiddler’s Ferry in Cheshire are thought by observers to be next in line for closure, from October 2019, when their contracts to supply backup power have expired. Drax in Yorkshire and Ratcliffe in Nottinghamshire are likely to be the last to close in the face of unfavourable economics brought about by the UK’s carbon tax and gas being cheaper.A spokesperson at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said of the coal-free milestone: “The UK leads the world in tackling climate change and this shows the time of unabated coal fired electricity is being ended by a cleaner, greener future increasingly powered by renewable energy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ac6cdd4ea490473a0a6af3b3830e28297875951/211_130_4747_2848/master/4747.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cc6104c1fcee890245270f9872a91b5","title":"eu britain brexit plan chequers theresa may","story":"Britain is making a fair and reasonable proposal, given the compromises that the government has had to makeDear Ambassadors and High Commissioners,I write regarding the British government’s Chequers plan, a white paper on which is published today. It’s two years since this country voted to leave the EU, and with just months remaining of article 50, I’m sure you will welcome more details on the UK’s Brexit proposals.All of you represent EU member states at the Court of St James’s in London. You must be spending a lot more of your time on Brexit than you would probably like to do. You might think your country didn’t choose Brexit, and that it’s a headache you could do without. But you would also recognise that the EU treaties themselves afford every member an option of leaving the union, in accordance with its constitutional requirements. That’s just what the UK has decided to do.Skilled diplomats, you are used to dealing with the world as it is, not as you would like to find it. And I’ve seen how you and your colleagues have turned your efforts to the challenge of finding a way through Brexit, to making sure that the UK maintains the strongest possible relations with its European neighbours, as they evolve on to a different level.For over four and a half decades, the UK has been a committed EU member, pressing for the completion of the single market and the extension of membership to countries of the former eastern bloc. Yet we always had a more detached relationship than many of our continental allies. We chose not to join the euro and the Schengen area. Frankly, we have always been more interested in a trading relationship than a political project. And liberal Euroscepticism has had a strong foothold here, on the political centre-left and centre-right, and in the press.Although the prime minister, Theresa May, made clear over a year ago that Britain intends to leave the EU’s single market and customs union, it has taken the government too long to come up with a more detailed plan on Brexit. Now, finally, it has.We need a path to a balanced relationship that would work for future decades. Most European leaders agree that this will have to be a bespoke relationship, designed to suit our size and proximity, as well as the historical, economic, personal and cultural ties between the UK and EU.So far, however, the European commission team, which negotiates on your behalf, has only offered the UK two unacceptable choices. On the one hand, Michel Barnier suggests a thin free trade agreement, which comes with the coda that the EU would indefinitely control regulations for the province of Northern Ireland alone – something that many in the UK see as an attempted “annexation”. On the other hand, there’s a relationship even closer than Norway’s, inside a customs union and single market, which would limit the UK’s ability to end free movement or control regulations across its wider economy. The latter would almost certainly prove politically unsustainable in the medium term, and – as we saw with Brexit itself – unsustainable political relationships tend to unwind in the UK.The Chequers plan tries to put forward an innovative, bespoke option for a new partnership with the EU. Essentially, it would entail the UK aligning with EU single market rules on goods, but able to erge on services and end free movement. The purpose would be to maintain essentially frictionless goods trade to support growth in all of our economies, and to avoid a hard border with Ireland.Some on the EU side claim that the free movement of goods, services, people and capital is “inisible”. But the EU has already entered relationships that ide these, and which allow partial participation in the single market – such as those with Switzerland or Ukraine.Others claim the UK wants to have its cake and eat it. Yet the Chequers plan would leave the UK with fewer obligations but also fewer rights. We would lose the ability to set rules on goods regulation, and would lose rights on free movement of services and capital.As a (soon to be) non-member, the UK cannot expect the EU to change its fundamental order to suit us. But equally, the EU should be able to accommodate a deep partnership with Europe’s second biggest economy and major security and military power. Although the UK is just one country, in size we are equivalent to the smallest 19 EU members. It behooves all of us to find a way to work out stable relations on our continent at a time when the transatlantic security alliance itself is at risk, and when all around Europe, and within it, we face unprecedented challenges.Your capitals will be looking closely at the detail of the Chequers plan today. As you will be reporting back – given recent ministerial resignations – this is very close to the maximum compromise the UK could sustain politically. The government has moved substantially to get here.I hope this proposal is taken seriously by European member states and the EU itself. I believe it should provide the basis for a future partnership. But if it’s judged insufficient, then I fear the British people will think that the UK has already made a fair and reasonable offer. They would be very wary of further compromise , and so regrettably our relations will probably end up being looser, with concomitant effects on both sides of the Channel for economic growth and security cooperation in the future.• Henry Newman is the director of Open Europe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb1b7c319a62ea7dab474d90d72029a6d8338f37/135_9_508_305/master/508.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53d4a372c412cc980a078147e0013ee8","title":"incredibles 2 film working mothers dads stereotypes men","story":"In a world oversaturated with superhero movies, The Incredibles has long stood out for its sheer relatability.

In a bid to get the superhero ban lifted Elastigirl is made the face of the campaign – to Mr Incredible’s absolute disdain – which means Bob’s job is to look after their children while Helen’s out at work.It’s great to see Disney lean in, giving its female characters more agency, and making Helen the breadwinner is certainly a progressive reflection of our modern world.

In my family, my mother is the breadwinner, my father works for her, and after she was elected to parliament in 1997 he became the main caregiver at home.He gave up his job doing public affairs for a Bloomsbury PR firm to become Don Valley constituency manager for my mum, Caroline, and to look after my two brothers and me in Doncaster while she was away in parliament during the week. Not once during that period were there any feelings of resentment about this part of our family dynamic. It worked well, for both my parents and us kids.My dad was content to cook us dinner each night, get us to do chores, help with homework and drive me to basketball practice and games several times a week. At the same time, my mother was tirelessly working to better the country, so I had a feminist role model not only in her but in my father too. I understand that this setup was probably atypical at the time 20 years ago, it would be tough to find many men willing to sacrifice their career to support their partner’s. Even today there are plenty of articles about how female breadwinners can poison a relationship, or why millennial women are worried about earning more than their male partners. There are still men who are stuck in their ways when it comes to gender roles, a bit like Mr Incredible. But there are plenty who are happy to play the “beta” role to their “alpha” female partners.In most cases, the dad is forced to take on the parenting role because of some unfortunate life event. In Mr. Mom and Daddy Day Care, the fathers lose their jobs in Sleepless in Seattle, The Descendants and Finding Nemo, the mothers die and the wives leave in both Mrs Doubtfire and The Pursuit of Happyness.Even when the parental unit remains intact, there are often still issues. Anders Holm’s stay-at-home dad in The Intern gives up his job so his wife’s business can succeed, but he’s unfaithful to her. Paul Ready’s Kevin in Motherland is always the laughing stock of the parent-teacher association. And who can forget Matthew Gravelle’s Joe Miller in Broadchurch? He killed his son’s best mate.As the film and television industry works harder to create female characters that are more representative of today’s working women, it’s time they gave working dads the same sort of treatment. Maybe that would help to dispel the stigma that stops so many men taking paternity leave, or help them to feel secure in earning less than their partners in order to spend more time looking after their children.Mums are superheroes, but dads like mine are too. Incredibles 2 does them a disservice – let’s give them a bit more credit.• Hanna Flint is a freelance writer and editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57a7027428de615e03ab64a199c796ee8180cf63/0_61_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08752440e09b5a8a55a8c6e8b1ee1388","title":"soft hard brexit no commons majority theresa may","story":"Theresa May’s new cabinet has now rallied behind her Chequers plan, set out fully in the government’s white paper on future UK-EU relations. However, far from settling the Brexit debate, recent events have given rise to another nightmare scenario that is only just beginning to take shape: that every conceivable Brexit outcome may now not command a parliamentary majority.The conventional wisdom in Westminster is that since the general election last year, there is no House of Commons majority for a hard Brexit. With a working majority of only 13, including the Democratic Unionists, it would take just seven Tory MPs to oppose it. But there are at least 20-30 pro-European Tories minded to do so. Yet May’s softer Brexit blueprint has also significantly increased the prospect of Eurosceptic Conservative MPs voting against her EU deal when it is put to parliament later this year.In the febrile atmosphere at Westminster this week, there have been rumours that up to 70 Tories could oppose it – especially if, as seems likely, May makes further concessions in order to win the EU’s backing for a bespoke deal, instead of having to choose between a Canada or Norway-style agreement. Hints in the white paper about a preferential system for EU migrants, despite May’s rhetoric about ending free movement of labour, will fuel the Tory revolt.May’s embrace for a softer Brexit has therefore changed the Commons arithmetic – and the political calculations that come with it. It is now Labour MPs, rather than Tory ones, who may prove critical. In recognition of this, May has been reaching out to Labour MPs in the hope that soft Brexit supporters vote for her deal, neutralising the impact of the Eurosceptics voting against it. In an unusual move, David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and May’s de facto deputy, briefed Labour (as well as Liberal Democrat and SNP) MPs on the Chequers plan.But Labour won’t want to save May. Their leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will almost certainly whip Labour MPs to oppose May’s deal, in the hope that the ensuing chaos will result in an election. (Labour’s six tests, which include replicating the “exact same benefits” of the single market and customs union, are designed not to be met). Although some Labour MPs are no fans of Corbyn and would be tempted to vote for May’s deal if it offers a sufficiently soft Brexit, they would be branded “traitors” and potentially threatened with deselection if they helped a Tory prime minister avoid an election that Corbyn desperately wants. So, it is highly unlikely that there would be enough Labour MPs to balance out a rebellion by Tory Eurosceptics.If neither hard nor soft Brexit can win a parliamentary majority, no-deal can’t either. Hardline Brexiters privately hope that such parliamentary gridlock would allow them to run down the article 50 clock to an accidental exit next March on World Trade Organisation terms. But MPs in all parties say they would intervene to prevent such an economically damaging no-deal outcome.Chequers and the white paper have helped crystallise the problem the government will face in autumn: there is no majority in the Commons for the softer Brexit now advocated by May the “Canada-plus” free trade deal favoured by the Brexiters or the no-deal exit next March favoured by hardline Eurosceptics. In these circumstances, a cross-party alliance would probably call for the two-year article 50 process to be extended beyond 29 March 2019, to which the EU would agree. But there would be no guarantee that further negotiations would produce an outcome parliament could support.Winning the support of the cabinet and the EU was already proving difficult enough. But May’s biggest – if not insurmountable – hurdle now clearly lies at Westminster.• Mujtaba Rahman is the managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76a18b5622d34722fe295a5df54b6456ab222e5e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d21c5461016f9cbafd683d57179efc2d","title":"world cup united england enjoy football","story":"It’s football, not a miracle: but sometimes it’s enough just to live for the moment, however fleetingThere is no such thing as the British dream. Or at least, that’s the lesson drawn from years of clunky political attempts to articulate it to create a version of the romantic story America tells about itself, an identity strong enough to hold a splintering nation together. On paper, Ed Miliband’s attempt while Labour leader sounded reasonable enough. The idea of a British promise – a deep, shared sense that children’s lives should be better than those of their parents – certainly described something missing from the post-crash nation. Yet it felt horribly clumsy for reasons that were hard to pin down at the time – and which, for me, finally swam into focus only earlier this summer when I read the story Raheem Sterling told the Players’ Tribune about his childhood.The sort of steady economic progress down the generations that Miliband talked about is more of an expectation than a dream, something we’d come to take for granted and are now enraged at having lost. But Sterling’s life story? Now that’s a British dream, however it ultimately ended on the pitch.Born in Jamaica, he came to England at the age of five, three years after his father’s murder. His mum worked as a cleaner while putting herself through college and had no choice but to take the children with her on the early morning shifts, waking them at 5am and roping them into scrubbing toilets. Later, once the young Raheem had been scouted by QPR, he and his older sister would take three different buses across London every Saturday just to get to training, then his sister would wait patiently for hours before the long trek home. Sterling’s mother came here with nothing, and now she’s the director of a nursing home while her son plays for his country.Or take midfielder Dele Alli’s triumph over a difficult childhood, estranged from his birth parents and drifting into gang activity. The kid who honed his skills in a car park using bikes for goalposts has now scored in a World Cup how many little boys with tough lives fantasise about that? And while barely one in a million will come anywhere near it, that in a way is the point. That’s what makes it a dream – a wild and crazy thing that almost certainly won’t come true, but provides a tiny glimmer of light in the darkness anyway.Dreams come from a place of hardship, not of comfort, because to dream is to escape. Football has always played this role in many fans’ lives, but this tournament has allowed the rest of us to understand that, perhaps more deeply than before.England’s past few World Cup runs have been all about expectation, followed by sour inquisitions when the team failed to meet it. But this one was made magical by the fact that we no longer expected anything. We’d resigned ourselves to being rubbish again and then somehow miraculously managed not to be, which is why defeat, when it came, was for once more sad than enraging. Like the freak June heatwave, it has had that genuinely dreamlike quality: a sense that any minute now we’re going to wake up, because this can’t be real.Summers aren’t normally like this. Football isn’t normally like this. The only thing resolutely living down to expectations now is politics, but the blessed respite of not having to think about that while the football was on was a gift in itself. Even people who don’t give a stuff about sport normally have been sucked in, because like the 2012 Olympics it was about much more than sport.Fandoms can be exclusive at times, resenting those who jump on the bandwagon. But this tournament has been, in a natural and unforced way, different. As manager Gareth Southgate said, his was a erse squad in which kids from every race and background can see themselves. But the inclusivity doesn’t stop there. Something about Southgate himself, tenderly hugging his young players and earnestly discussing their feelings, made it all right for those normally put off by all the testosterone.Here was more than one definition of Englishness: St\u0026nbspGeorge’s flags and God Save the Queen for some, but also waistcoats and self-deprecating jokes and pictures of the team playing like big kids on blow-up unicorns in a swimming pool. It’s this kind of English identity that has lately become lost in the shouting, something elastic and generous enough to be whatever the English need it to be.But if the football really didn’t move you after all this, then this extraordinary summer has also given us the British cave-ers in Thailand. Rick Stanton and John Volanthen were middle-aged men you wouldn’t look twice at in a crowd, yet possessed of such extraordinary hidden skill and valour that a nation glowed with borrowed pride when they helped turn what looked like inevitable disaster into success. Both the rescue effort and the football were a reminder of the astonishing power of teamwork, of humility and mucking in rather than letting egos run rampant.And that spirit of togetherness was infectious. How often do 30 million of us gather around the telly all at once? Yet the semi-final lured even surly teens from their bedrooms to the family sofa, and gave little ones the illicit thrill of staying up long past bedtime. For once, the devices we’re used to blaming for stressed and fragmented lives helped make it an even more genuinely collective experience. Family WhatsApp groups pinged like crazy through the match, strangers shared every tense moment on Twitter.And when Kieran Trippier scored, prompting thousands at open-air screenings to hurl their drinks into the sky, images of exuberant crowds lit up phone screens. Even when we lost, people hesitated before piling in to criticise: “but they’re still so young”, “they tried so hard”. The morning after felt punctured but wistful, like coming home from a beach holiday with sand still just about between your toes. “Let’s keep this unity alive,” tweeted defender Kyle Walker. But can we?One great sporting summer doesn’t make Brexit go away, reverse the Windrush scandal, paper over the cracks in British society and craft a new national identity overnight. It’s football, not a miracle.But if dreams often turn out to be of limited practical use in the cold light of day, then it’s arguably unfair to expect otherwise. We don’t dream in order to change a harsh reality, but because we crave relief from it. And if this team can’t possibly provide all the answers around national identity, then at least for a few precious weeks they let us stop hysterically overthinking the question. Not everything has to mean something. Sometimes it’s enough just to live for the moment, however fleeting for the sheer transcendent joy of England, team or country, feeling good about itself for once."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cbc6649a2cda16b60b0054cc09b32e8816aae94/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=812f1135cdca541f1ef422101cead87c","title":"the best mens floral print shirts for all ages in pictures","story":"Make the Hawaiian shirt the star of your holiday wardrobe.

I was too young to even know, thank God, what a condom tasted like. It was so inappropriate, and what the heck was a casting director doing with a condom in his pocket in an audition?”In the same podcast, Sorvino also called out “one big director” who she says “has Oscars” and is known for his “social justice profile” who ended an audition by saying: “You know, as I look at you my mind can’t help but traveling from the artistic possibilities to the sexual.”Sorvino had previously come forward with her own story about disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein, alleging that he sexually harassed her. Peter Jackson later revealed that Weinstein had told him not to consider her for a role in The Lord of the Rings as she was difficult to work with.The actor has also apologized for working with Woody Allen on Mighty Aphrodite, the film that won her an Oscar for best supporting actress. In January, she penned an open letter to his daughter Dylan Farrow, who claims that he molested her as a child. “I cannot begin to imagine how you have felt, all these years as you watched someone you called out as having hurt you as a child, a vulnerable little girl in his care, be lauded again and again, including by me and countless others in Hollywood who praised him and ignored you,” Sorvino wrote for the Huffington Post. “As a mother and a woman, this breaks my heart for you. I am so, so sorry!”Sorvino was recently seen in the mini-series Condor and her upcoming roles include thriller Look Away with Jason Isaacs and comedy Stuber with Dave Bautista."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebcb6915f546acf3c68eae5251a08b4100a0928a/0_196_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f4b0441c01b8c97170148fa610ea5e1","title":"club des femmes radical feminist queer film","story":"A series of film festivals celebrating political and cinematic resistance puts women firmly back in the centre of the frameThe summer season at the movies is traditionally a time for tentpoles and blockbusters, but this year’s wonder women don’t wear bulletproof bracelets. Independent cinemas are offering a sizzling summer of radical, intersectional film as an alternative to the franchise releases. A revival of radical movies made by feminist and queer film-makers from the 60s promises to show that revolutionary cinema and the spirit of 1968 isn’t all about angry young men.As the weather sizzles, provocative films by directors including Věra Chytilová, Agnès Varda, Laura Mulvey, Greta Schiller and Mai Zetterling will raise the temperature inside the cinema, too. Leading the charge, the queer feminist collective Club des Femmes has collaborated with the Independent Cinema Office, the BFI and several international archives to roll out a programme called Revolt, She Said: Women and Film after ’68, to venues around Britain. The season is named after Julia Kristeva’s 2002 book, which defines revolt as “a permanent state of questioning, of transformations, an endless probing of appearances”.The films, which range in vintage from 1966 to 1991, speak to this idea in different ways. The oldest in the season is Daisies (1966), Chytilova’s kaleidoscopic classic, an irreverent vision of female rebellion the most recent is Pratibha Parmer’s A Place of Rage (1991), a documentary featuring interviews with Angela Davis and Alice Walker on racism and homophobia.“The story of ’68 as it’s often told is one that’s very much about a certain kind of masculine energy, a certain very explosive political activism,” says So Mayer, a co-curator of the programme. “We wanted to look at how women were at the forefront of many of those movements, and they were often making the first moves, and the first artistic moves, and then maybe their work was sidelined or less seen.” Mayer highlights Parmer’s A Place of Rage: “One of the things it’s about is the place of women, and particularly queer women, at the forefront of the African American liberation struggle, particularly the militant struggle, and of LGBT politics.”Four 1980s films in the selection, for example, deal with subjects and movements as geographically erse as the Troubles in Northern Ireland (Pat Murphy’s Maeve, 1981), the nuclear protest at Greenham Common (Beeban Kidron and Amanda Richardson’s 1983 Carry Greenham Home), LGBT culture in the US (Before Stonewall, Greta Schiller, 1984) and the life of indigenous women in Australia (Tracey Moffatt’s Nice Coloured Girls, 1987).At screenings, audience members will be able to pick up copies of the old-school typed-and-stapled Revolt, She Said zine, which places all the films on a timeline of history from the Cuban revolution in 1959 to the birth of third-wave feminism in 1992. New essays on all the titles, some of which have been very hard to see before, are available on the Club des Femmes website and many of the screenings will be combined with panel discussions to thrash out the politics and aesthetics of the films. The anger of these movies still seems uncomfortably relevant to the current political landscape, but perhaps cinema offers a therapeutic way to deal with these issues, beyond raising consciousness. The question is, says Mayer: “How do we bring together this desire to celebrate intergenerational relationships, activism being handed down, the things that we’ve changed, the gains that we’ve made, to reflect all of that, while also experiencing anger at incredible injustices and inequalities?”The 1977 feminist musical One Sings, the Other Doesn’t is a great example. Watching Varda’s playful exploration of the friendship between two women and their struggles is particularly poignant in 2018. The film may be entering its 40s, but the lead characters’ fight for the right to legal, safe terminations in France reflects recent events in Ireland. Its theme of female solidarity and the quest for personal happiness is timeless, while the lyrics to its quirky musical numbers are often drily witty and provocative at the same time – one song quotes Friedrich Engels’ comment that in a family “the man is the bourgeois and the wife is the proletariat”.Varda, who is still working at 90, is the subject of a continuing retrospective at the BFI Southbank in London and her latest video installation opens at the Liverpool Biennial this weekend.The other films in the season provide a backdrop to Varda’s seven decades as a film-maker. They are all deliberately stimulating: from Chantal Akerman’s domestic tragicomedy Saute Ma Ville (1968), to Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen’s landmark video essay Riddles of the Sphinx (1977). The idea is that on leaving the cinema you will be enthused by the boldness of the film-making or inspired by the voices you have heard – ideally both. “It’s never just a radical exercise for its own sake,” says Mayer: “The formal and political radicalism are always working hand in hand, trying to wake audiences up, to get them thinking and seeing in new ways.”In fact, one film in the programme, The Girls (1968), Mai Zetterling’s brilliant re-imagining of Lysistrata, poses the question of what it means to be an active, engaged audience. Bibi Andersson plays the leading actor in a revival of the Aristophanes sex-strike comedy who is frustrated by her snoring audience and confronts them disconcertingly from the stage. “You’re sat there like stuffed creatures … Don’t you understand that it’s we who make the world what it is?”Revolt, She Said and Club de Femmes are not working alone. There are a proliferation of feminist and activist film festivals in the UK, as well as erse programming groups who curate one-off screenings and seasons. Bristol’s Cinema Rediscovered festival at the end of the month includes a strand called Women on the Periphery that will screen a series of feature debuts and shorts by female directors including Ildikó Enyedi, Margaret Tait and Gurinder Chadha.Mayer hopes Revolt, She Said will “open us up to a different way of thinking about film history – it’s not auteurist, it’s not national, it’s not about movements”. There’s an important film-preservation angle to the project, too, because it has always been tough to get hold of work by marginalised film-makers. Beyond censorship issues, very few prints tend to be struck in the first place and independent low-budget productions are often plagued by copyright limbos and distribution problems. Now that digital copies have been made of these works, they will reach broader and broader audiences, this summer and beyond.“With these kind of films, just obtaining the materials is a process of often detective work, persuasion and a lot of conversation,” says Mayer. “It seems counterproductive to do that and then not invest in making it so that other people don’t have to go through that again in 20 years’ time.”One example of this recovery process is a German film, Ula Stöckl’s 1968 work The Cat Has Nine Lives. This gorgeous, essayistic and often melancholic movie was Stöckl’s graduation film, and it follows five women testing the boundaries of the late 60s as they try to discover what they want out of life and how to get it – and it is the first question that is the most difficult to answer. The film sank without trace after its distributor went bankrupt and it was years before it was rediscovered and heralded by Christa Maerker as West Germany’s first feminist film. It was recently restored by the Deutchse Kinemathek, allowing its vibrant Technicolor photography to shine. Now, it is screening as part of Revolt, She Said.In a mordant fantasy sequence in the middle of The Girls (1968), a group of men congregate to chuckle over their womenfolk’s latest complaints. “Do you know what I think?” offers one of them, between guffaws and slaps on the back. “I don’t think women ever existed!” It’s a suggestion that tickles his comrades, who fall about all over again. “Whatever the case,” replies his pal, “we’ve always behaved as if they didn’t.”It is a grim analogy for the film industry, in which the contributions of women have consistently been erased or sidelined, even though they have been making successful and often very progressive films since the silent era. These screenings constitute part of the fight to put female film-makers, and their radical voices, back into the canon and to the narrative of film history, which is ripe, in Kristeva’s words, to be questioned, probed and transformed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46942a9b60a011405acdabf11794b3226e6c1639/0_87_4898_2940/master/4898.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab1479ba40f5bc572740d3e7c394eb24","title":"gus van sant dont worry he wont get far joaquin phoenix","story":"The acclaimed film-maker discusses new film Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot and how he ended up in a hip-hop videoJohn Callahan, the quadriplegic cartoonist and subject of the new film Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot, fits right in among the free thinkers dotting the filmography of director Gus Van Sant. In a career ning three decades, Van Sant has consistently gravitated towards those subversives and visionaries who go against the grain of mainstream society. That unorthodox streak can work to their benefit, as with the janitor genius of the populist hit Good Will Hunting. Sometimes, it’s to their detriment, as with the free-living drug addicts of Van Sant’s early arthouse sensation Drugstore Cowboy. Most frequently, though, it’s a combination of both. As seen in his biopic treatments for Kurt Cobain and Harvey Milk, Van Sant’s got a thing for martyrs, for those able to transmute the agony of their mere existence into great and meaningful works. All of which has brought him back to Callahan, and to the famous Phoenix acting dynasty. Van Sant has tussled for years with the idea of a film about Callahan’s extraordinary life – a car crash left him without use of his legs or fine motor skills in his arms, but didn’t stop him from clasping a pen between his hands and illustrating his hilariously dark, darkly hilarious jokes. The project was initially conceived as a collaboration with Robin Williams, and rewritten several times as matters of scheduling or financing precluded a start to production. Williams’ death in 2014 could have permanently shuttered Don’t Worry, but Van Sant found a suitable replacement in a past collaborator.“I started from scratch again,” Van Sant says during a curiously terse interview, possibly due to a shaky phone connection. “The other screenplays from 1997 and 2002 were written for Robin, and this time around, it was my first time writing for John Callahan, writing for the book. When Joaquin got involved, I started writing with the idea that he would play it. I still knew he’d have his own spin on it, though. So I wasn’t so much writing it for Joaquin as I was envisioning it with him in mind.”A virtuosic actor who could not possibly care less about pursuing movie stardom, Joaquin Phoenix sounds a bit like one of Van Sant’s creations. The pair first linked up in 1995 for the black comical vérité-style crime yarn To Die For, in which a then 21-year-old Phoenix portrayed a student seduced into murder by psychotically ambitious newswoman Nicole Kidman. Since then, they’ve stayed close as their inidual profiles have grown.They rehearsed for two weeks prior to the start of shooting, finding the character’s affect, calibrating his sincerity and sarcasm. As the film makes clear, Callahan was a complicated guy, a sensitive soul prone to jags of neediness or even cruelty. By his own admission, Van Sant didn’t know what to expect when he let Phoenix have at the character, though he had complete confidence in his leading man. The script includes some rather demanding material for a performer, in particular a rock bottom that finds Callahan dragging himself around the floor like a slug in an effort to retrieve a wine bottle that’s rolled under a chair. But when questioned as to whether these were difficult days on set, Van Sant sets the record straight.“Working in the first hospital was hard, because of the rotating gurney,” he recalls. “It was old, sometimes it malfunctioned. But whatever scene we’re working on, we make it as hard as we can. If it’s not hard, we push it until it is. That’s what you end up doing, because if you sit there and you let it be super easy, you’re going to be phoning it in.”Phoenix and Van Sant have achieved a creative synthesis that many artists spend their entire lives searching for, where intuitive understanding makes communication seamless if not unnecessary. That degree of closeness takes time to build, and in this particular instance, their bond is strengthened by their shared memory of Joaquin’s older brother River. Before River died from an overdose, he worked with Van Sant on My Own Private Idaho, perhaps Van Sant’s most widely acclaimed film. When I liken Don’t Worry to Milk in their reorganizing of one man’s conflicted struggle against adversity, Van Sant makes the counter-suggestion that the film is more similar to My Own Private Idaho or To Die For in its elliptical treatment of time. It does not seem coincidental that he names the two films fronted by Phoenix boys.But if this conversation painted Van Sant as a man bound up in his own past, it also gave him ample opportunity to look to the future. He’s a man comfortable in seemingly any position or showbiz milieu, acting as executive producer to films in need of a push through production and cameoing as himself on Entourage. Most recently and outrageously, he appeared in the Jonah Hill-directed music video for Ain’t It Funny by Detroit rap maniac Danny Brown. The surreal, violent video casts Van Sant as the wholesome father figure on a sitcom with rot at its root, an bizarre gig by which he nonetheless sounds unfazed.“To be playing a character, it’s good for a director. Reminds you of how difficult it is, to wear a costume and say lines. But I don’t know that I’ve got much street cred in the hip-hop community,” he deadpans.His amenable attitude extends to his business dealings as well. Don’t Worry comes to theaters courtesy of Amazon’s fledgling movie studio, a somewhat disorienting logo to see pinned to a film by one of American independent cinema’s poster boys. But Van Sant is unintimidated by new horizons, stating that Amazon and other streaming platforms have “opened up tons of opportunities” for longform storytelling. When asked whether he’d ever try his hand at the limited series that his indie cohorts have been flocking to in droves as of late, he’s entirely amenable to the idea. He’s not at all concerned about the shift away from brick-and-mortar cinemas.“Movie theaters really were just constructs of the past’s industrial cinema, where it was easier to get thousands of people to see one print at the same time,” he says. “Now, it’s a different industrial construct. You might see it on a smaller screen, but the original films were shown on nickelodeons, which had very small screens.”With this, Van Sant places himself on the same frequency as Joaquin, or River, or John Callahan, or the defiantly different characters on which he trains his camera. He’s a reminder that indie is short for “independent”, pursuing his intimately personal thematic and stylistic whims wherever they may lead him. And that’s not always into critical favor his last two films, the mortality meditation Sea of Trees and fracking drama Promised Land, have drawn mixed-to-poor notices from the press. In typically singular fashion, however, he has paid them no mind and in fact doubled down on his intrinsic Van Sant-ness to realize a long-gestating passion project.In Don’t Worry, after Callahan places his first newspaper cartoon, he starts wheeling around town to excitedly show everyone who will give him the time of day. When a pair of art students pass him by without stopping to look, he hollers back at them with an unprintable word. And yet in that moment, Callahan seems only amused by their disinterest. One gets the sense there’s a bit of Van Sant in that moment: a man fully and happily committed to doing his own thing, everyone else be damned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec55b36070a1f2173ebe444210f148c0f247aae7/0_21_3356_2014/master/3356.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3633fdd3699fecb8748af21c0e820a25","title":"the goalies anxiety at the penalty kick review wim wenders","story":"A murderous footballer’s journey is the focus of this majestic mediation on madness, misogyny and the American dreamWim Wenders’s debut movie from 1972, now on rerelease, is a fantastically strange, lugubrious existential crime noir based on the novel by Peter Handke (with whom Wenders co-wrote the screenplay). It is now sadly stuck with the clumsiest and most tin-eared translated title imaginable, terrible compared with The Goalkeeper’s Fear of the Penalty, which was what Handke’s book was generally called for English-speaking audiences. It is a bit of an ironic time for this film to reappear here, of course. The English no longer have any fear of penalties.The scene is a football match in Vienna, where the goalkeeper for the visiting side is shown impassively standing in the goalmouth watching the action at the other end. He has the faintly Kafkaesque name of Joseph Bloch (played by Arthur Brauss). But in a few moments, there is a disaster. Bloch concedes a goal without even trying to save it, because he was certain it was offside. When it becomes clear the referee is going to allow it, Bloch gets involved in a furious argument with opposing players and the ref there is pushing and shoving and he is sent off in disgrace. Moody and subdued, Bloch gets a tram into town where he checks into a cheap hotel and turns on the receptionist’s TV in time to see his team concede another goal. He wanders around, goes to the cinema, picks up a young woman, goes back to her place, then the next day picks up Gloria (Erika Pluhar) the woman who sold him his ticket at the cinema, goes home with her too – and murders her.Then he gets the bus to an obscure border town to visit an old flame, Hertha (Kai Fischer) who owns a hotel there. He presumably wants to lay low for a bit. But he never betrays the smallest anxiety about what he has done, not even when he sees in the newspaper a pretty accurate photofit of his face and what the police are calling a vital clue: he has left some American coins at the scene of the crime and told strangers about his interest in America and his team’s tours in the US. Bloch simply mooches about the place, listlessly making conversation with the locals, flirting with and irritating Bertha, listening to the jukebox (he loved doing that in Vienna too) and finally showing up at a local football match.Here he gets into conversation with the man on the terraces next to him and waxes eloquent on the existential crisis a penalty involves for the goalkeeper, that great trial he has to endure for a teammate’s crime. If the goalkeeper knows the striker usually hits the ball into a certain corner, should he gamble on ing for that corner? Or will keeper and striker second-guess each other? Bloch also broods on the weird spectator experiment of ignoring the play and just watching the goalkeeper – that sad figure, alone in the universe like humankind, waiting for something to happen, waiting for the great challenge that will test his very raîson d’etre, but unable to influence when and how it does. (Bloch doesn’t mention it but Albert Camus, he of the acte gratuit, famously played in goal.) Is Bloch a serial killer? Gloria seemed to initiate BDSM when they had sex, which is how the murder developed, so it is possible this was Bloch’s first crime. But he is eerily calm afterwards. It is more likely he does this at all away games – a macabre piece of misogynist black comedy. Yet he is so blank, so sociopathic, that the experience of doing it for the first time may not feel any different from doing it for the 20th time. Everything we see in the second half of the film – including his strange bucolic holiday with an old flame in the middle of nowhere – may be how he comes down after a murder, how he realigns himself after the horrifying secret act. And yet he is not in fact entirely calm: he is obsessed with noise, always asking about sounds he can hear from other rooms or from the street.The dialogue is really unsettling. Strange non-sequiturs abound. After Gloria tells Bloch about the strange dream she has just had, Bloch asks her: “Are there ants in your teapot?” And then: “Were there ants in your dream?” The screenplay is full of curious, dreamlike declarations. An inn owner will suddenly tell Bloch: “Those antlers are from a stag that wandered on to a battlefield.” There is a what-just-happened? feel to so much of the script.And then there is the Americanism of the film, which was to be a theme in Wenders’ work from then on. Bloch adores America, and the idea of America, because it is exotic and exciting and glamorous. America says freedom and escape, and when Bloch journeys to Burgenland in eastern Austria it looks wild and empty, a bit like the American midwest. But Wenders is not just playing on the romance of America, but also its dark side. Bloch’s America is the America of Jim Thompson. This is America as a lawless and cruel place of violence. Bloch carries it around in his head."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aad591254d5db77a7b3be3d22190d2f7e91ac0f9/185_140_3506_2104/master/3506.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaa1a77d5bd1e1b059620b68284327f5","title":"england gareth southgate world cup russia 2018","story":"Southgate you’re the one. England’s single greatest upgrade at this World Cup: they have a manager who sweated the small stuff that makes the big stuff. The great skill of Gareth Southgate has been to manage the details around this team, to implement the “elite sport” habits of British Olympic and cycling success through sports science, psychology, useful gimmickry. A carefully-schemed team culture has been fostered. Players have been picked on the basis of ability to “buy into” this, as well as physical types: fit, athletic, good habits. England borrowed the “No Dickheads” rule from the All Blacks. And they’ve become likeable. This isn’t surprising. They haven’t got any dickheads. The fact this kind of quality is being rewarded is progress in itself. But still not quite whole again.Southgate talks constantly about development. He will know the tactical, game-management part of his World Cup was less of a feature. This is understandable. Southgate is still inexperienced. England don’t have much on the bench to play with. Still, though, England’s substitutions were a non‑event. The tactic of pumping long passes forward in the semi-final became predictable. The entropy after half‑time against Croatia was reminiscent of other tournament deaths. Back in 2002 Southgate himself noted that England needed Winston Churchill but got Iain Duncan Smith from Sven Goran Eriksson. Watching on Wednesday night from his latest franchise-league outpost as England ran out of ideas, Sven might just have sighed a little to himself. There is much to ponder, as well as build on.The best thing about the past year has been Southgate’s understated ruthlessness. From the overdue ousting of Wayne, to the refusal to take anyone to Russia who wasn’t fit or in form, there has been a heartening element of coldness to the manager’s judgment calls. That must now be applied to his group, to the next step. No favourites. No favours. Keep on pruning back the dead heads.Keeping the ball, passing carefully. This was the revelation of England’s tournament, a genuine first right up to the moment they started sending it long and trying to hit Raheem at the Luzhniki. This was modern. This was progressive. This actually looked like international football. Don’t turn back now.At what point does going on about how you don’t go on about your team become going on about your team? How easy is to remain humble when everyone talks constantly about how wonderfully, spectacularly humble you are? It is easy to imagine that the hype will now be ramped up again, the expectations lumped on once more, the train cranked back into gear. The test from here is to keep that throttle low, to accept that England beating Panama, Tunisia and Sweden should be a cause of enjoyment and fun. But it’s not yet a sign of the second coming (home).There is a sub-set of human being who will maintain England somehow fluked a semi-final, that any team they managed to beat must, by definition, be useless. This is clearly misguided. England beat Sweden, Ukraine and Wales at their last three tournaments combined. They have just won three games and a shootout in a month. To denigrate this is sour grapes, the agony of seeing somebody you automatically dislike doing quite well for once. Either that or a degree of English arrogance that insists ultimate victory is the only kind of victory. Portugal drew with Iceland, Austria, Poland and Hungary en route to winning the last European Championship. Is Cristiano Ronaldo also a hair-gelled fraud? The sensible view is that this team performed with energy and adopted a set of tactics that worked against opponents at the same level. The parts that succeeded can be built on. The rest is just noise.There will also be carping about Harry Kane’s proximity to the golden boot. Three penalties, a deflection and two tap-ins. Just Fontaine must be bricking it. But Kane actually showed his ruthlessness at this World Cup. There is a reason his six goals were carved out of only 12 shots. England just didn’t make many chances from open play. Luckily they had a one-shot sniper on board when the moments came. There may be issues with this team. But Kane really isn’t one of them.They didn’t before the World Cup. They do know. Jordan Pickford may still make mistakes, may have some dips, but he was probably England’s best player in Russia and deserves a long run at this now.It has become hard to assess publicly Raheem Sterling’s role. Demeaning, racially tinged coverage of his personal life by the news pages of some newspapers has created a polarised position. Halfway through the tournament it was being suggested that in fact Sterling was playing wonderfully well, with the implication that to say otherwise was either further victimisation or a sign of football blindness. The truth is somewhere in the middle. Sterling performed the role given to him with energy, pulled the centre backs around and created space. But a large part of his job as a No 10 is to make or score goals and he lacked precision at vital moments. Sterling is one of England’s best players. But this simply wasn’t his best position.The evening changed in Moscow as Luka Modric began to get on the ball. Suddenly this felt like a two‑tier game. Hold everything: the talent’s here. England have no comparable midfielder, the kind of player who helps you beat the better teams. But there is playmaking talent in the age groups that might be identified and groomed. If only Pep Guardiola could get properly stuck into Phil Foden for the next two years. Pray, England fans, for a Manchester City creative midfielder injury crisis.Or Jadon Sancho. Or Callum Hudson-Odoi. Or Xavier Amaechi. Or Sven Hibblethwaite-Thomas. There will be an urge to fetishise England’s younger talent, to suggest some great new brave shining dawn is on the verge of breaking. But those younger players must battle with Premier League short-termism just for game time, and will require above all patience and the right to make the odd wrong turn. Stay calm. Again, defy the hype. And Sven Hibblethwaite-Thomas doesn’t even exist anyway.Good luck Gareth. History suggests you’ll need it. One of the side-effects of success has been the neutralising of a notoriously demanding press pack. Southgate has become bulletpoof through this World Cup, wearing a suit of armour in the form of three precious tournament wins. The wider culture has co-opted him. The news pages want to know whose shirts he wears. But it won’t take much. A few poor qualifying results. The realisation that England have an essentially defensive style. You can see how that could play out. All the more reason to stay patient, and for Southgate himself to keep working and improving, always trying to run ahead of the surf."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0848c5ca17b7c2d1f3393d0c9718543f6bb06205/4_375_3915_2349/master/3915.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4ed5f7831173b69ab3cb22221364149","title":"england harry kane belgium world cup third place play off","story":"• Striker two goals ahead of Romelu Lukaku in Golden Boot race• Alexander-Arnold, Rose and Eric Dier set to start final gameGareth Southgate will assess Harry Kane in training on Friday before determining whether his captain, pursuing the World Cup’s golden boot, will start in the third-place play-off against Belgium in St Petersburg on Saturday.Kane tops the scorers’ charts with six goals, two clear of Romelu Lukaku going into their teams’ second meeting at the tournament, and three from France’s Kylian Mbappé and Antoine Griezmann, who will compete in the final. The striker, rendered ineffective by Croatia, has declared himself fit, though the personal trophy would not compensate for the disappointment endured in Wednesday’s semi-final.“The third-place game is not a match we wanted to be in,” Kane said. “But we will try to play with as much pride as we can and finish on a high. We will still be thinking of the semi-final defeat, and what could have been, but of course I want to play. Everyone will want to.“We are extremely proud of what we have achieved. We know we have restored pride in the England shirt, back home as well, so we can hold our heads up high. But we know that it is an opportunity lost. The aim now is not to have to wait another 20-odd years to get into another big semi-final.”Southgate does not expect Kieran Trippier, Ashley Young or Jordan Henderson to be fit, the wing-backs having picked up injuries against Croatia and the midfielder having aggravated a hamstring complaint.“It will be more about the physical capabilities of the team,” the manager said. “It’s the chance to have our second‑best-ever finish and the chance for the players to get a medal. So there’s that and there’s the pride in playing for your country again.

It turned out to be rhetorical as he answered it himself by adding: “It’s Croatia, don’t even doubt that!”Vecernji’s website devoted an unusual amount of space to gloating over the fate of the losing team, with headlines such as “Football’s not coming home”, “The arrogance hit them back”, “The English are sore losers” and even published a photo gallery titled “Look how the English cry after losing to Croatia” with pictures of downbeat players and fans.The 24 sata daily published a video from the team’s hotel, where players can be seen standing on a dinner table and singing along with veteran entertainer Mladen Grdovic. “Pinch yourself and don’t worry, you aren’t dreaming, this is reality,” wrote Marko Snidaric. “Close your eyes without any fear, and when you open them you’ll see Croatia celebrating. You’ll see Croatia crying. Out of happiness.”Jutarnji list gave central space to quotes from players. “Croatia is burning, but we haven’t burned down yet,” Danijel Subasic said. Sportske novosti, the nation’s only daily sports newspaper, was full of praise for the manager, Zlatko Dalic, claiming he has outdone every other Croatia coach by leading the team to the final. “France, who are better than England, can hardly stop them,” wrote Drazen Antolic. “That will be a true final, a top clash between the two sides who have shown the most at the tournament.”Index.hr, a popular website, acknowledged that England were the better side in the first half, but when Ivan Perisic scored, Sasa Cobanov said, “it was the beginning of the end for the English”.Telesport’s Juraj Vrdoljak compared Croatia’s second-half comeback to an “adrenaline-driven man lifting a truck to save his child”. Croatia emerged victorious, he stated, after “clinching her teeth and biting on a knife in the manner of Cholo’s commandos before using it to rip the history apart at the finishing line”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e53e1880c1ef768b906c57be492fb6cbf25e1ba3/0_167_5024_3014/master/5024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1458f6f5c8e9adac0dacaf1d72406db9","title":"penny finally dropped newly disciplined paul pogba","story":"Samuel Umtiti was first up, with Paul Pogba to follow, as France looked ahead to Sunday’s World Cup final against Croatia with a press conference out by the magnificent New Jerusalem Monastery to the west of Moscow. If Umtiti had any illusion about his warm-up act status, he was disabused of it within seconds of pulling his chair to the table.“Ladies and gentleman, I present Paul Umtiti,” the France federation media officer said, before wishing he could have his time again. To be fair to Umtiti, who has been in fine form at the tournament, he took it well. The Barcelona centre-half stood straight up and, to no little laughter from the audience, strode off in mock a fashion. He would return.Everybody was waiting for Pogba and it was ever thus but particularly so before this World Cup, after his erratic season at Manchester United. What sort of Pogba would turn up? The smart money was on the celebrity midfielder, who must give free rein to his talent and, if that means overlooking the dirtier aspects of the job, then fine. It was the attitude that had driven the United manager, José Mourinho, to distraction and it was one that helped to place a significant wedge between them.The Pogba that has shown in Russia has been a revelation. It has not been on the same scale as Kylian Mbappé, who has electrified France’s progress to a fifth major final in 20 years, but it has been a revelation nonetheless.“It’s a pleasure to defend,” Pogba said, early on in his Q\u0026ampA session and at that point one almost had to rub one’s eyes. Mourinho, from his seat as a pundit for RT, has to have been doing the same.How has Didier Deschamps managed to draw such discipline and balance from him? Or, to put it another way, how has the France manager succeeded where Mourinho has so often failed?“Pogba played with great maturity,” Mourinho said of his performance in the 1-0 semi-final win over Belgium. “When he had to hold his position and keep control of the game, he did. When Deschamps took off Olivier Giroud for Steven Nzonzi, Pogba had more freedom but freedom not to do silly things. Freedom to keep the ball away from the dangerous areas. To keep the ball, to assist Antoine Griezmann for a great chance. He was very, very mature.”The impression has been that a penny has somehow dropped in Pogba but why should it be? How has he come to strip things back to what truly matters, a theme he reinforced when he considered Mbappé’s outrageous touch and backheel that almost laid on a goal for Giroud against Belgium? “If you do a great move and it’s efficient, it’s good,” Pogba said. “But if you lose the ball, it’s bad.”Perhaps it is the magnitude of what is at stake or, maybe, the effect of having N’Golo Kanté alongside him. It is fair to say that Pogba has not always played with this degree of control in a central midfield two for United. Another theory is that there are 89 million reasons for Pogba to feel he has to turn on the style at Old Trafford – equating to the fee that the club paid to take him from Juventus. Yet another is that it is simply down to greater experience this is not Pogba’s first World Cup, rather his second. Whatever it is, self-sacrifice has been the theme for him.“It is a World Cup and we have to sacrifice,” Pogba said. “We have to defend. It’s not what I do best but I do it with pleasure. We have the same objective and it is to win. I think I have become more mature and all the other players help me a lot on that.“Antoine Griezmann, for example, is a forward but he talks to me. He tells me to go back to defence. If I get better, it’s thanks to the team and the coach. The second World Cup is different from the first one. You play against teams with experience, against great players and I also cannot play the same way as I play for my club. We have found a balance with everyone and with N’Golo Kanté.“We run together, attack together, defend together – it’s when we are strongest. Even the critics have helped me to improve but that doesn’t mean they should start criticising me! I think the image that people have of me has changed. I am playing as a midfielder now, which is my role. I am being less offensive. I think people judge me now on my role as a midfielder and not as a player who can score goals and make assists.”Pogba is 25 but, according to Umtiti, he has always been a leader. Now, the feeling is more pronounced. Pogba is one of the strongest voices in the squad. His presence fills the room. “Patrick Vieira gave me some advice,” Pogba said of the former France captain. “He told me to talk, to give out advice and I do it now. Vieira has always been an example. He is a born leader.”Pogba and France have narrowed their focus. The run to the final has been exhilarating but it will count for nothing if they do not beat Croatia. That is the mentality and it has been shaped by the experience of Euro 2016, when they beat Germany in the semi-final and expected to sweep past Portugal in the final. They would lose 1-0. Over-confidence was their downfall. This time they are determined to see the job through.“At the Euros we probably thought we had already won it before the final,” Pogba said. “When we beat Germany, we thought it was the final. We are aware of that mistake now and we don’t want to repeat it. We will prepare differently. The holiday after 2016 was horrible. I still remember it. It was a very bitter taste and no one wants that again. We haven’t come this far to lose in the final.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf16481fce8c1286b042f8cf15ab731a3796349f/0_103_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3e2e53052328171fea559f50491ca28","title":"transfer roundup fulham sign 25m jean michael seri nice kenedy chelsea","story":"West Ham have agreed a club record €38m (£33.5m) deal to sign Felipe Anderson from Lazio, with the Brazilian winger set for a medical on Friday.Having completed a deal for Ukraine international Andriy Yarmolenko earlier this week, West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini was also keen to add Anderson to his squad as he prepares for the new season. Negotiations with Lazio for the 25-year-old began last month, having initially seen an offer of €35m (£30.8m) rejected but an agreement has now been reached that will exceed the £25m paid for young French defender Issa Diop earlier in the summer.Meanwhile, Andy Carroll and Winston Reid are both facing three months out injured. Former England striker Carroll and New Zealand defender Reid have returned home early from a pre-season training camp in Switzerland to undergo follow-up operations on injuries suffered last season. Richard Collinge, head of the club’s medical department, told whufc: “Andy played and scored in Sunday’s match (against FC Winterthur) but is still reporting some discomfort in his ankle and further scans have revealed that he requires some minor surgery to provide more strength and stability to the area. “Winston has been suffering some swelling around the knee injury that he sustained at Swansea last season and he too is in need of explorative surgery to clean up the area. We have decided that this is the best course of action to ensure that both players have a chance of returning to full fitness as soon as possible.” Fulham have beaten off competition from several European clubs to sign the Nice and Ivory Coast midfielder Jean Michaël Seri for a club-record fee in the region of £25m, on an initial four-year contract.The deal represents a significant coup for Slavisa Jokanovic, the Fulham head coach, given Chelsea, West Ham United, Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund, among others, were also credited with an interest in the 26-year-old. But, Fulham moved quickly to make Seri their maiden summer signing following promotion to the Premier League.Fulham have also confirmed the signing of Seri’s former Nice team-mate, the 28-year-old defender Maxime Le Marchand, to take their summer business north of £30m. They remain intent on adding former loanee Aleksandar Mitrovic on a permanent deal, while Jokanovic is also keen on Dedryck Boyata, the Celtic and Belgium defender.Meanwhile, Newcastle United have re-signed the Chelsea winger Kenedy on a season-long loan. Rafael Benitez had hoped to sign the Brazilian on a permanent deal but is happy to have him back at St James’ Park, where the 22-year-old impressed after arriving on loan last January.Kenedy is Benitez’s third summer signing after goalkeeper Martin Dubravka from Sparta Prague and midfielder Ki Sung-yueng from Swansea. Meanwhile, the midfielder Mikel Merino has exited for Real Sociedad having determined to leave Newcastle after losing his first team place in the second half of last season.“I’m really pleased to have Kenedy back with us,” Benítez. “I’m sure every fan will be happy with this signing. “Hopefully he can keep playing at the same level that he reached with us last season. I wish him all the best.”Barcelona have signed the Sevilla defender Clément Lenglet after activating the 23-year-old’s buyout clause. The Frenchman exits Sevilla after a successful maiden season at the club following his move from Nancy last summer. The centre-back scored four goals in 52 games last season.Lenglet has signed a five-year deal, with the La Liga club inserting a €300m release clause in his contract. Upon his arrival, Barcelona described Lenglet as “one of the most promising defenders on the planet.”Meanwhile, Everton have turned their attentions to Barcelona left back Lucas Digne as they look to make the first signing of Marco Silva’s managerial reign. Silva is keen to reinforce Everton’s left flank prior to the new Premier league season and, having been deterred from pursuing a deal for Kieran Tierney by Celtic’s £25m asking price, the club have registered their interest in French defender Digne.Everton are also keen on Barcelona central defender Yerry Mina, a key figure in Colombia’s World Cup campaign, but he wants to know whether he features in the Spanish champions’ plans for the new campaign before deciding his future.Mina could be available on a season long loan while Digne would be a permanent transfer should negotiations, led by Everton’s new director of football Marcel Brands, reach a successful conclusion.

In the lexicon of Italian football journalism, that phrase – “white smoke” – is used to convey the moment when a drawn-out coaching appointment or transfer saga reaches its conclusion. The imagery is borrowed from the Vatican, where ballots are burned to let the world know when a new Pope has been elected. In this case, the smoke might simply be rising from the end of Maurizio Sarri’s latest cigarette.To say that Chelsea’s new manager is fond of a puff might be understating things. Dries Mertens estimated Sarri’s daily consumption at five packets a day. The manager is almost as keen on his coffee. At Napoli, he would have the club’s shopkeeper bring him a fresh espresso out at set breaks in training every day.Routines matter to Sarri: in part because he is a superstitious inidual. Mertens observed in another interview that Napoli would swap back and forth between specific different training pitches every day, changing the schedule only whenever a winning run came to an end.More than that, though, Sarri is a man who sees strength in consistency. Napoli have rarely surprised anyone with their tactical approach over the last three years, lining up every week in the same 4-3-3, and yet they have swept opponents aside with a dazzling brand of football.Arrigo Sacchi, who forged one of the greatest sides in European history at Milan in the late 1980s, has hailed Sarri as a “master” and his team as a “godsend”. They share a footballing philosophy, creating sides that are compact and seek to dominate possession. And they share the fact of never having played the game professionally as well.From his 20s right through to his 40s, Sarri’s day job was at Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, where he specialised in interbank finance. Coaching was something that he did in his spare time, for the love of the game.Even now, he struggles to frame football as a job. “When I go to lead a training session I never say to my family: ‘I’m going to work,’” he told the newspaper Avvenire. “I come from a family of labourers, and if I hear someone talking about ‘sacrifices’ in football, I get mad.”The contrast between his background and that of his predecessor at Chelsea is too obvious to ignore. Antonio Conte was a European Cup winner and five-time Serie A champion with Juventus as a player even before he led the Bianconeri to three further domestic titles from the bench. Sarri arrives in west London having never won a major piece of silverware.What he did do, in Naples, was create a team that challenged for the title on a wage budget barely half the size of Juventus’s. The team he inherited at Napoli had finished fifth under Rafa Benítez in 2014-15. Under Sarri, the Partenopei finished second, then third before last season becoming the first club to fail to win Serie A despite breaking the 90-point barrier.He did all this despite having the ision’s top scorer, Gonzalo Higuaín, signed by Juventus in the summer of 2016, and then seeing the player brought to replace the Argentinian, Arkadiusz Milik, tear his cruciate ligament weeks into the new season. Lacking a true No 9, Sarri reimagined Dries Mertens as a centre-forward. Napoli finished that campaign with 94 Serie A goals.And yet, for all he is reputed as an attacking coach, the greatest gains achieved in Naples might have been at the other end of the pitch. Napoli had conceded 54 goals in the league during their final season under Benítez. Under Sarri the figure has dipped to 32, 39, then 29. “Balance is the secret for every team,” he insisted in an interview with Il Mattino. “There cannot be a defensive formation and an attacking formation: such a concept is a limitation. The attacking capacity of a team is the fruit of the work of the manager and of the quality of the players.”As any coach, Sarri has his flaws. He has been accused in Italy of being too rigid: his almost ideological refusal to erge from set methods – and preferred starting XIs – leading journalists to brand him as a “Taliban trainer”. Critics have suggested that his Napoli team failed to win the title last season because he had failed to rotate against weaker teams, leaving players exhausted by the end of the season.Others will be more troubled by accusations of homophobia levelled against him by Roberto Mancini – who claimed Sarri called him a “faggot” during a Coppa Italia semi-final in 2016. Or indeed the response the Napoli manager gave to a female journalist, Titti Improta, who asked him about Napoli’s title prospects after a draw against Inter this March. “You’re a woman and you’re sweet,” Sarri said. “For this reason, I won’t tell you to go fuck yourself.”Sarri was quick to apologise after the latter incident, yet we can say Chelsea’s newest hire is not a man who puts public image over instinct. Before Napoli’s win at Juventus in April, he was caught on camera showing his middle finger to opposition fans from the team bus.Chelsea can see white smoke at last. The fireworks are still yet to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c1ac5be095dad40682a2a986d6b897f36d0d8dd/0_107_5152_3092/master/5152.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c32f0f2d0cd2c058299ff45d07c6a52c","title":"france croatia final world cup full of surprises deserves","story":"Teamwork has triumphed over inidual brilliance in the tournament so it is right that the finalists best represent that shiftFrance v Croatia is a surprising final but also a good reflection of this World Cup. After all it has been a tournament full of surprises in which we have seen that a different type of football is required to succeed, one based on team work and sticking to the basic principles over a reliance on inidual players and moments. France and Croatia have best represented that shift neither has sparkled but they have been consistent and hard-working and hence they will do battle on Sunday for the ultimate prize.France are rightly favourites to win what would be their second world title. They are the complete team – solid at the back, well-balanced in midfield and able to play with real flair in attack. But they have not done that often during this tournament due to the manager’s low-risk policy and seeming desire to do no more than what is required to win the game in front of him.Watching Didier Deschamps’ side, I have consistently been left with the feeling that there is another gear they can go to and this is also what makes them dangerous opponents – you cannot switch off against them for a second.Croatia will, therefore, need to be patient and not leave themselves as exposed at the back as they did during the first half of their semi-final against England. They were incredibly open during that period and, in truth, were lucky not to be more than 1-0 down. However, Croatia also showed during the second half that they are a remarkably mature and resilient team and one that, unlike France, play to their absolute limit. They will push Deschamps’ men all the way.Croatia’s aim will be to turn the final into a physical battle as this is the type of game their players like, no one more so than Mario Mandzukic. I played with him at Wolfsburg and as well as being a very good finisher he is a really hard worker, in training as well as on the pitch. He is constantly moving, constantly making life difficult for the defenders he comes up against and besides being prepared to take a challenge will give back as good as he gets. He is fearless.Ante Rebic is similar. I have watched him a lot in the Bundesliga with Eintracht Frankfurt and he is another attacking player who likes a physical battle. He and Mandzukic lead from the front, setting the tone for the entire team and, as Mandzukic showed against England, providing a killer touch at key moments.There is no doubt, however, who Croatia’s best player is. Luka Modric has been excellent during the tournament and particularly in the second half against England when, alongside Ivan Rakitic, he ran the game. I faced Modric in my time with West Ham, when he was at Tottenham, and I’m still traumatised by the experience. I couldn’t get near him he passed when he needed to pass, dribbled when he needed to dribble and basically did not make a single wrong move for the entire 90 minutes.What also stood out about Modric’s display on that day at White Hart Lane was how he protected possession. Much like Andrés Iniesta and Xavi he makes up for his lack of size and stature by getting his body between the ball and his opponent in the correct fashion. It may not look like much but it makes a huge difference.Someone else who is very good at that is N’Golo Kanté. Like Modric he is a deceptively strong midfielder and, for me, has been France’s best player at the World Cup. His sense of positioning and anticipation is consistently excellent as well as crucial to giving Kylian Mbappé and Antoine Griezmann the platform from which to attack they know they can pour forward as they have an ultra reliable player behind them.Given he was a similar player himself, I’m sure Deschamps appreciates what Kanté gives France and he will be vital in what is sure to be an important midfield battle in Moscow. Whichever team wins that is likely to win the match.For many people this has been a great World Cup. I disagree with the assessment. It has been unpredictable, interesting and fun but, overall, the quality has been lacking, certainly to the level provided by the Champions League. It has been a tournament more about great teamwork than great teams, hence the progress of the two teams that have reached the final as well as, of course, England.Gareth Southgate and his side deserve great credit for getting to the semi-finals and, more importantly, reconnecting the country with the national team. We have lost that a little bit in Germany so please, if you are English, cherish that as you reflect on this World Cup. I for one have enjoyed it and look forward to the final. It should be fascinating."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75527e5e63cb4581f343a99b9daf6c5816c3ac9d/303_0_5169_3101/master/5169.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8901ddd2ee849c46b5d548ae4d0d4289","title":"refugee world cup moscow russia","story":"Amid the World Cup euphoria a low-key but no less vital competition was played out in the shadow of the KremlinA few hours before England’s World Cup game against Colombia in Moscow, a very different series of football matches was under way on Red Square.There was no penalty shootout drama but off the pitch the stakes for some of those involved were much higher. The five-a-side tournament, held just outside the walls of the Kremlin, pitted teams of refugees against each other, and was meant both as a celebration of ersity through football and as a message to the Kremlin over Russia’s restrictive asylum policy.Some of the players had fled conflict in Africa or the Middle East, while others were aspiring footballers from African countries who had been trafficked to Russia with the promise of a playing contract.One was Joshua Olumide, an 18-year-old from Ondo State in Nigeria, who said his father had taken out a loan to pay a man who promised him a contract with a European club. He was given a Fan ID, the document that allows visa-free travel to Russia for the duration of the World Cup, and told he would be met at the airport in Moscow.Nobody met him and another Nigerian who had also made the journey with a promise of a contract. He spent five days living in the airport and has since been living in makeshift accommodation in Russia trying to get money together for a ticket home. “It’s very sad but I am going to have to go home. My father took out a big loan to help me come here,” he said.Russians have welcomed with open arms the hundreds of thousands of foreigners who have descended on the country but it is feared the effect may be only temporary and is unlikely to extend to those seeking sanctuary rather than just arriving for a few weeks of football.Svetlana Gannushkina, one of the leading Russian rights activists working with migrants and refugees, said Russia’s basic position on asylum is “nobody is given status and we pretend that refugees don’t exist”.She said only 592 people had been given refugee status in Russia in recent years. The one exception has been those fleeing the conflict in eastern Ukraine, who have a relatively easy path to either temporary residency or citizenship.For Syrians, of whom Gannushkina estimated there are between 5,000 and 6,000 seeking refugee status in Russia, the process is much harder: she said only two had been granted status. The tournament on Red Square was a reminder that many refugees are talented and hard-working and she hoped the “celebratory, friendly mood” of the World Cup would continue after the tournament is over.“It’s really symbolic to have these games played here,” said Piara Powar, the executive director of Fare, an umbrella organisation promoting ersity in football that helped set up the tournament. “To see these guys, some of whom have no papers, whose kids are being fed and educated by volunteer groups, playing football in the shadow of the Kremlin is quite something.” He said assurances had been sought and given by Russian authorities that the refugees would not face document checks or arrest if they came to Red Square for the tournament.Alexei Smertin, the former Chelsea and Russia midfielder, and the anti-racism inspector for Russia’s World Cup committee, played in one of the games, which took place on a five-a-side pitch set up on Red Square for the duration of the World Cup. Other games have included a match between England and Russia fans, which the Russians won 15-1."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f8f6ff40520d47c32857b65dcc3601e705bb180/0_86_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc=\u0026amp;s=764f9a2269d35c8fe1b3dfdfb812db62","title":"englands dreams over as croatia take the next step world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss the end of England’s World Cup dreams, Bond villain defenders, third-place play-offs, West Ham’s transfer approach and FW live"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/929cfba0316944d0a70f72cc5c016b9d2380e94c/0_65_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2e861c753cc91eac65382c55f1cb67c","title":"world cup 2018 countdown england belgium france croatia russia live","story":"Some confirmation of what we already knew: Chelsea have finally announced they have sacked Antonio Conte, giving the Italian a rousing send-off, with a curt three-line, 61-word statement. No mention of Sarri just yet, but the former Napoli coach is on his way:Gianni Infantino, who is paid around $1.61m-a-year, rocks up at Fifa’s closing press conference in a volunteer’s hoodie. How fitting. Infantino, the governing body’s president, declares Russia 2018 as “the best World Cup ever” before adding that the perception of the country has been changed, and that it now has football running through its veins. “Football’s part of its DNA now.”Back in Blighty, it has been a bit of a circus at Cobham this week, with Antonio Conte taking training on Thursday before getting the boot by Chelsea a few hours later. He departs awaiting compensation for his £9m-a-year contract, which had 12 months to run. With Conte sent packing, Mr Sarri will enter Stamford Bridge:Transfer nugget: Xherdan Shaqiri could become a Liverpool player today, with the Switzerland winger undergoing a medical on Merseyside after meeting the £13.75m relegation release clause in his contract at Stoke City. Meanwhile, Southampton are closing on the signing of the Denmark international Jannik Vestergaard, who passed a medical yesterday. Saints will pay Borussia Mönchengladbach around £18m for the 25-year-old centre-back. And he could face his soon-to-be former club as early as 4 August, when Southampton host the Bundesliga side in a friendly. If France do win it, will Didier Deschamps get the praise to go with it? He has carefully harnessed a wealth of talent and, at times, they have made hard work of things by appearing content to coast through games, eking out victories rather than running away with them. Deschamps captained France in 1998 and will lead his country in Moscow on Sunday:After keeping Kane quiet and muzzling Messi in Russia, the Croatia coach, Zlatko Dalic, is confident they can snuff out Kylian Mbappé. “Croatia can still play better,” the 51-year-old said. “France are a very dangerous team but if we stopped Messi, Eriksen, Kane ... we can stop Mbappé and Griezmann too.”England news: each member of Gareth Southgate’s 23-man squad is training in Zelenogorsk this morning. There had been injury concerns over Kieran Trippier, Ashley Young and Jordan Henderson, with the wing-backs having picked up knocks against Croatia and the midfielder having aggravated a hamstring complaint. But, good news it seems.Killer stat: a couple of days old now, but lasting nevertheless Bayern Munich and Internazionale have had at least one player in every World Cup final since 1982, with Ivan Perisic and Marcelo Brozovic flying the flag for the Serie A club in Moscow on Sunday, and the midfielder Corentin Tolisso representing Bayern for France. Some quick maths means that’s 10 tournaments in a row:If we cannot indulge in France’s stars of yesteryear now, then when can we? Here’s Marcel Desailly’s all-time XI, or you can make your own decisions by creating your own. They have had some mighty good players, and Didier Deschamps’ team now, especially going forward, is not too shabby either:Get Thomas Hitzlsperger’s take on Sunday’s final:France are rightly favourites to win what would be their second world title. They are the complete team – solid at the back, well-balanced in midfield and able to play with real flair in attack. But they have not done that often during this tournament due to the manager’s low-risk policy and seeming desire to do no more than what is required to win the game in front of himAway from Russia, there are a frenzy of transfers:“As much as all of us are looking forward to the last two matches,” begins Julian Craven. “I’ve just realised that on Monday the World Cup will be over, Wimbledon will be over and that the Tour is on a rest day.” Fear not, for Cardiff City are in pre-season action at Tavistock AFC, and you can count on us for your sporting fix:What would a bronze medal really mean for England? More than pride? Or something bigger than that? Perhaps nothing? One thing’s for sure, it will line the coffers, because victory on Saturday would reportedly result in £18m for the Football Association toEngland players have said all of the right things since that defeat – trotting out how this is different, the unity and reconnection with supporters, which is great – but will they do all of the right things against Belgium on Saturday? One thing’s almost for certain, though, because Harry Kane says he is fit enough to captain England once more, though surely Gareth Southgate will be tempted to shuffle the pack a little Trent Alexander-Arnold, Eric Dier and Danny Rose are all likely to start.Fresh out of theWant a warming, fuzzy tale to start the day? Meet the Agence France-Presse snapper, Yuri Cortez, who ended up buried beneath Mario Mandzukic and Ivan Rakitic, and promptly smothered by a delirious Domagoj Vida, after Croatia punctured England’s hopes of World Cup glory in extra-time in Moscow on Wednesday. As for the final, the photographer has pinned his colours to the mast. “I feel a bond with Croatia now, I identify with them,” he said, chuckling. “So I’m going to cheer for Croatia. Without a doubt.”Alas, that’s all from me, Richard Parkin - thanks as always for your correspondence. Stepping into the hotseat is Ben Fisher, who promises me he hasn’t been ransacking any Ikeas or jumping on ambulance bonnets lately. Treat him kindly.A humorous side effect of the World Cup being played in between football seasons is the presence at this hugely-watched global event of the occasional “unattached” player.When you think of all the clubs around the world, and how many football operations managers, directors of football, scouts etc that must be watching these games it’s never a bad chance to push your wares, but it does always surprise me that the occasional player still ends up on the open market under such circumstances. A Simon Elliott (google it) or Tim Cahill going into a tournament for once last hurrah, fair enough. But a player at the peak of their powers?Come Sunday we could have the remarkable situation of a player walking out in World Cup final that doesn’t have a club side.I hope Milan Badelj’s agent has a few burners, because when 3.2bn eyes tune in there might be some interest.I mentioned earlier how Russia 2018 has been a tournament thus far devoid of major negative events or scandals, a fact that Russian media (and state offices) have started to crow about.I’m personally apprehensive to weigh in too much on this, being greatly orced from the circumstances on the ground and also knowing that my love of football might occasional represent a temptation to shy away from some of the well-documented issues plaguing the nation under the Putin regime.One man far better placed to comment is Shaun Walker, who as Moscow correspondent for over a decade has a decent handle on the situation:And while Germany may have departed Russia 2018 prematurely, one of their number who’s remained is the excellent Thomas Hitzlsperger, who has a fresh column out for  previewing the final:Glad to see a shout-out to the hard-working Ante Rebic there.For all the talk about Luka Modric - and don’t get me wrong for a second, the guy can play - many have been guilty of underappreciating some of the other players in the Croatian squad. One standout for me has been Ivan Perišić, whose sheer determination during the second-half of their semi-final with England alone did more for his nation than say a Neymar or even a Messi did as both Brazil and Argentina crashed out.I’ve watched over and over how it was that somebody who’d already played over 530 minutes across the tournament manages to win the header to set up Mandzukic’s winner the desperation in the leap, the composure in the directing of the header - it speaks to the will of an absolute champion, and Croatia has had plenty more like him thus far.Divya Suresh weighs in on the issue of VAR:Good Morning Richard. In the latest World Cup Football Daily, (a very sad) Max and co. spoke about how VAR would have over-turned the offside ruling on Harry Kane’s two goal attempts in the England vs. Croatia game. To me, this casual acceptance  acknowledgement of VAR being useful is quite a victory. As someone who watches tennis, the lack of technology in football has continued to baffle me, though I understand some of that now.It’s an interesting point, Divya, and I do wait to see how VAR is embraced across Europe’s top leagues in coming years. As alluded to previously, in the trial case of the Australian A-League its been hugely isive thus far but perhaps the devil is in the implementation.Incidentally if you missed Max et al. here’s the link. Like watching Dancer in the Dark, though, make sure you’re in the right frame of mind for this one:And speaking of the English media, did they have a hand (as so often) in their own nation’s demise? Not through disproportionate scorn this time, but perhaps ill-timed praise?A lot was said about England’s seclusive training base, and how it insulated the players from a lot of the mania emanating from back in England. I often wonder if Fabian Delph’s return home and then re-joining of the camp introduced this a little, like a virus, to the playing group with the midfielder being quoted as telling his teammates about the borderline hysteria that was generating back home ahead of the semi-final and how the others couldn’t believe it.Who can say. Maybe that’s a hot-take waiting to be written by a tabloid paper still desperately seeking a David Beckham-style scapegoat, should the collective mood lurch from calm reflection back to full outrage mode.Our btl regular “USfan” with another highlight:With only 180 minutes of football left - half of which don’t really count - I feel confident in stating that the iconic moment of this tournament, its finest highlight, was Manuel Neuer being dispossessed deep in the opposition half against South Korea, and the beautiful brilliant ball played 60 yards in the direction of the German net he had vacated, which looked to be rolling out of bounds but sat up just long enough for Son to get on the end of it and roll it into an empty net: 2-0, Germany out of the World Cup in the group stages.There was not a finer moment than that. I say this bearing no ill will at all toward a German team whose accomplishment I never begrudged. It was just such an extraordinary moment.The iconic moment? I guess we’ll await what the final throws up, but I’d have to say I agree, it really felt a totemic moment, and the German newspapers certainly registered the seismic activity that took place.Incidentally, the moment referred to was brilliantly captured by The Times who led with a photo of that for their match report - just one of very many excellent, albeit none too sympathetic, reports among the UK press.A massive talking point pre-tournament was of course the introduction of VAR, and as an inveterate opponent of video technology (football fans from around the world please watch the A-League grand final and tell me VAR is a boon for the game) - it both pains and delights me to say that after all the hoo-haa, perhaps (*touches wood, World Cup final pending*) it hasn’t been the utter debacle many feared?A key difference between, say, the VARs rollout in Australia and at the World Cup might be perhaps the advantage of having multiple VARs - when two or three extra pairs of eyes are watching it knocks out the possibility of bizarre subjective decisions, requiring an aspect of conference taking place between the video referees over some of the more “interpretative” takes on what constitutes a “clear and obvious error”?That said, clearer guidelines around handball incidents, what constitutes “ball-to-hand” etc, might be worthwhile given some of the more contestable decisions we’ve witnessed on that front. What do you think has VAR made the world of football a better place?Penelope Cottier has emailed, commenting on a minor hate-crime I committed earlier on this blog (now amended): VAR on that apostrophe, please.Well played, madam. Maybe more eyes are better than one.Some wonderful selections there - the Japanese fans cleaning the stadium after the match (as did the Senegalese) a lovely touch especially after that terrific round of 16 match against Belgium. Wasn’t that one of the corkers of the tournament and to think one of our semi-finalists could have gone home nearly two weeks ago.Spain-Portugal, what a match. Also Portugal-Iran, which maybe it was the early signs of time-zone-related fatigue setting in for yours truly but I did get surprisingly emotional at full-time for that one I think because of the utter heartbreak for the Iranian players who had given absolutely everything.Germany-South Korea. Phwaor. How bout that. Surprisingly, nobody’s mentioned Mexico-Germany yet - which let’s face it, was the original upset of the tournament, and the game that set up one of the most fascinating group battles in recent tournament history. The roiling horrorshow that was Argentina. Late drama v Nigeria, shock draw v Iceland and of course the seven-goal thriller with France.Pavard’s goal in that one - was that the goal of the tournament? What else caught your eye?And of course, celebration of the tournament. As rightly pointed out, perhaps Michy Batshuayi has a hard lock on that title.But, to the tournament more generally, and the highlights and lowlights. Here’s your early suggestions:High point (from an England viewpoint) Gareth Southgate. Low points, Colombia match behaviour (both sides, but predominantly Colombia). From a wider perspective, high point: all the fabulous matches, barely a dud amongst them. Low point : it’s nearly over!Best moments some of the spectacular goals, the Spain-Portugal game really enjoyed that one. Also Japan’s tactics against Belgium brilliant.Highlights - Batshuayi ricochet, Spain for 30 mins in the first half vs Portugal, second Korean goal v Germany, Russian women in the crowd, England banishing their shoot-out hoodoo, Roy Keane, Brian Kerr, George Hamilton, Ally McCoist, Mbappe’s burst vs Argentina, Modric, the World Cup of the underdog, James Richardson, Glendenning \u0026amp Rushden, kick-off times GMT, little or no reported violence, Messi’s half time team talk in the tunnel. Ronaldo going home.Low points - Belgium v France, England not going for the kill vs Croatia, Damien Duff somehow managing to make everything about himself, Iran not scoring a second vs Portugal, Cavani injury, Deschamps, Neymar, the stark and absurd absence of Firmino, France.And here’s the thoughts of “PeterIonVancouver”: Best moments? Undoubtedly the sight of fading Teutonic energies amidst the industriousness and perseverance of Southern Korean spirit. Watching the Japanese fans clear up the stands after their national team exited with great honour to a stronger Belgian side comes a close second. And Bravo England. And speaking of conceptions post-1998 - now even the mascots are rutting, with France announcing their new star for the 2019 Women’s World Cup.If you’ve forgotten Footix, here he is.Sadly the official press release doesn’t have anything to say about who Ettie’s mother is. Let’s hope that’s not a scandal in the waiting come France 2019.Ahh, Mad Mario. You literally cannot hate this guy. His post-game interview was a study in human emotions - wide-eyed like a crazed stallion, still scratching for breath almost twenty minutes after his decisive goal.Teammate Dejan Lovren has gone one better though with his post-match media comments, explaining why such a small nation can produce so many talented athletes.Scarily perhaps none of the Croatian squad in Russia were born post-98 so if those street parties in Split are anything to go by, who knows how many mini-Modrics are set to announce themselves on the world football scene at Qatar 2022.And speaking of media, you may have seen Luka Modric was not shy in letting the English press know just how important a role they played in Croatia’s spiritual late revival, especially having been written off as “tired” or “exhausted” following two consecutive 120-minute-matches, and the emotional rollercoaster of penalties, twice.“They should be more humble and respect their opponents more”, was the instruction from the midfield maestro, who celebrated his side finally stepping out of the shadow of the fabled Croatian class of ‘98.And while England fans may be understandably downbeat, you can’t help but get caught up in the infectious enthusiasm fans from this tiny football-mad nation have ahead of their country’s first ever World Cup final, where by all accounts there were pretty wild scenes.Even the Croatian PM and his cabinet got in on the act, rocking the casual Friday look:Presumably the one or two ministers who missed the memo are now staring at demotion or strong voter backlash.And one of my favourites going round the photos from the photographer Yuri Cortez who got caught in that extra-time crush of Croatian players have come out, and some of them are absolute crackers.Being an English masthead before it became a global masthead,  is beholden to perhaps run a closer rule over England’s performance at this World Cup, so please do forgive the indulgence, global readers, if this feels a bit St George-centric, but if you cast your mind back to the toxic reception the England class of 2014 got after finishing bottom of their group in Brazil, it’s nothing short of a modern miracle, this English footballing renaissance.Barney Ronay with some wise words and precautionary advice for the English public and media, going forward:Psychologically at least, you’d presume Belgium go into this one with an edge, given the disappointing nature of England’s capitulation, having gone ahead early only to then surrender their World Cup final berth to a never-say-die Croatian outfit.This lovely piece from Daniel Taylor captures some of Gareth Southgate’s personal disappointment, but also why optimism remains ahead for this young English group of players:And so, 62 matches gone, 2 still yet to come.Usually, one of these is largely irrelevant with all eyes turned to the final, but the reunion of two of the fancied challengers at this World Cup, Group G buddies England and Belgium makes the 3rd place playoff at Russia 2018 a rare intriguing clash. Often an unwanted denouement, this one might actually be the full-bloodied version that was denied on June 28, where both nations rolled out “B” sides with group progression secured.And as opposed to a Germany, Argentina or Brazil say, whose players might hate the fact they have to play this last game when a finals appearance had been the expectation, there’s a real chance both these nations might actually take a fair degree of pride in coming third.And of course, there is of course the not insignificant subplot of the race for the Golden Boot - with the tournament’s two leading scorers, England’s Harry Kane and Belgium’s Romelu Lukaku one and two in that race, and with one last chance to improve their tallies.Kane has expressed his interest to play we imagine Lukaku would likewise:Morning has broken, but mourning continues. No, that’s not quite fair. In truth the reaction to England’s semi-final loss has been notable for its even-handedness, reflectiveness and dare we suggest it, even mild positivity, after what was in reality a campaign that largely exceeded expectations. This, within the territory boundaries of England that is we won’t dwell too much on how the news has been received elsewhere in the “United” Kingdom (and around certain pockets of the globe).There are no matches today alas, which seems a fair chance to reflect on what has generally been regarded as an excellent World Cup both on the field and around it, with few major scandals off and some excellent football played on the pitch.So perhaps today we indulge in a joint stroll down memory lane and discuss our highlights, lowlights and favourite moments of Russia 2018? They say you don’t know what you’ve got until it’s gone, so let’s embrace this tournament, during the lull before the final grand hurrah and inevitable conclusion.Correspondence is most welcome: via email (richard.parkin.casual@the), via twitter (@rrjparkin), or simply comment below the line.

While the likes of Lego Star Wars, Lego Marvel Super Heroes and Lego Lord of the Rings are jammed with wonderful characterisations and detailed level design features, Lego Indiana Jones and Lego Pirates of the Caribbean felt rather less … loved. Lego The Incredibles wobbles and falls into the latter category. With a storyline that merges both Incredibles movies into one rather tortured narrative, this is very much Lego by numbers (or Lego by instruction booklet).Controlling each member of the Parr family, employing abilities from Mr Incredible’s brute strength to Elastigirl’s rubber limbs, you solve puzzles, beat up enemies and destroy the scenery to earn studs, which can be spent on unlocking new additions to the cast. It’s a formula that developer Traveller’s Tales has rarely strayed from and when it works, it works. When playing co-op with another person in the same room, learning how to combine characters’ powers is a lot of fun – especially if the other person is a child figuring out how to solve video game conundrums for the first time. There are also new group-build sections, where players need to work together to construct giant Lego buzz saws and fire extinguishers. It’s a very modest gameplay addition, though, and does little to broaden the familiar experience.Other characters from the Incredibles and wider Pixar universe gives fans of the films more to look forward to – you can even unlock Dory from Finding Nemo, who floats surreally in a little ball of water. This is also a good interpretation of the Incredibles visual style. The luxury yachts, TV studios and tropical islands you explore are lushly coloured and have a 1960s comic-book vibe that mimics the aesthetics of the Pixar films. The central city of Municiberg has a retro-futuristic vibe, and provides a place for players to explore and get involved with mini-quests and crimefighting ersions – though it doesn’t compare with what you’ll find in Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2.Everything about Lego The Incredibles feels a little second-ision. The narrative, which deals with the second movie first before going back to the original, is slapdash and disorientating there are noticeable visual bugs and glitches throughout. However, like almost every Lego title, there are enough funny cinematics, cool little features, and engrossing puzzle-solving moments to keep children playing. The combination of knockabout humour and object-smashing action still works, even though the whole Lego game model is starting to creak at the foundations.It’ll take quite a masterwork to truly revive the golden days of Lego Star Wars – but for now, the Lego production line is still doing just enough to appease fans who know what they want and don’t mind not getting much more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then.

This is the best bit of covering sport. I’ve been going to tournaments for the  since 2008, and looking back I’m still amazed at the sheer amount of hard work and the sheer volume of content produced around these occasions. From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted. At the end of which comes the daily web presence and the pristine design and set of the paper itself. All of this arrives with you updated to the second, cobbled together from the corners of some sock-stinking press room, polished by endlessly patient whip-smart subs and made to look lovely by some sleep-deprived awkward genius of a layout designer. It’s no secret our industry is looking to find ways of continuing to do all this. The old way of selling bits of paper doesn’t seem to work. Advertising is a capricious business.

But sometimes it works out that way. Nick Cave had written most of Skeleton Tree, laced with images of falling bodies and empty echoes, prior to the death of his son. Last spring, Melody Prochet was ready to release Bon Voyage, her second album as Melody’s Echo Chamber. But then the French musician suffered a serious accident that put her in hospital for months.“It has always been mysterious how my lyrics have this long echo or pre-delay in my reality,” says Prochet. “It is something I have noticed before and I try not to interpret, because it’s too strange.”Prochet answers questions over email, a policy of the few interviews she has agreed to. She can hear a donkey “screaming” and church bells chiming from the window of her home in a remote Provençal village. She won’t disclose what happened: it is nobody’s business but family and friends, she says, but one media outlet went digging for more information. “I think that’s very wrong and I have no idea where it came from.”Her objection feels reasonable. Beyond the basic intrusion, women’s art has for too long been legitimised by their willingness to expose their pain. No artist should have to suffer to be taken seriously and Bon Voyage, now out on Domino, stands outside Prochet’s trauma. It creates a different world altogether, in fact: a lysergic fantasia as surprising as an anime landscape. Nods to Serge Gainsbourg’s Histoire de Melody Nelson butt up against Swedish screaming, thanks to her Scandi collaborators, Dungen’s Reine Fiske and the Amazing’s Fredrik Swahn. Prochet calls the album an “adult promise to my inner child’s heart”.Plus, she was accustomed to having her story stolen. Her self-titled debut, released in 2012, was produced by Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker, her then boyfriend. Most of the press focused on this detail, framing the record in the context of his catalogue and asking her what he was like. “I remember being as happy as I was frustrated,” says Prochet.The acclaim for an artist at her level – underground even in France – was huge. She was grateful to Parker for his dedication. “I couldn’t complain, but in my heart something felt wrong with the press and people’s reflections. Maybe my only regret is that as a friend and producer he never acknowledged it and didn’t do anything to protect me or my work.”For her second album, she found support from Flying Lotus, who let her record demos in his Los Angeles studio and declined to get involved because he said she did not need him. Tyler, the Creator reached out, too. But Bon Voyage was born in Stockholm. Seeking refuge from the “brutality” of Paris, Prochet moved to the suburb of Bagarmossen and worked with Fiske and Swahn in nearby Solna.Their setup has been described as a woodsy idyll, although that is not quite the case. It was a hodgepodge of sessions grabbed when “reality, time, money” allowed. They worked in an industrial area, not a fairytale glade, with “shady businesses, junkie neighbours”. One morning they arrived as the studio was being robbed. “We were so scared they would come back that Swahn had to install some jail-like doors, which we hated doing,” Prochet says. “It was as punk as it was cosy and warm, a fabulous place to feel the freedom we lacked outside.”They respected each other “so deeply that it couldn’t fail”, says Prochet, the process “absolutely restoring my confidence as a musician”. She felt trusted and enforced naps to allow everyone to digest their ideas. She went back to music school to learn drums – “it was so rewarding to hear the obvious progress” – and overcame her perfectionist streak to write violin arrangements with Fiske. She had always lacked self-belief, she says, although it was not helped by “some patronising and bullying behaviours in the music industry”.After her accident, Prochet didn’t think Bon Voyage would ever come out. She credits her sister, Marika, with saving it. “It’s about the trauma and disillusion it caused me personally to become an adult woman in a mad world.” She doesn’t know if she will ever tour with the album – she is pregnant with her first child and needs “all my time and energy for love and building my family”. And she doesn’t know if there will be more music any time soon, either. Having spent months in a hospital bed, she is dreaming, from her Provençal village, of getting out and walking the world again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1576dc2b0c118f479106eb31e05a1f61bbb4675f/0_217_4887_2931/master/4887.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72fbb0ce63105b951556d3bdcd4f7cbf","title":"the 10 best paul simon albums ranked","story":"As the singer plays his last ever UK shows this week, we rank his greatest albums, from 1965’s Paul Simon Songbook to 2016’s Stranger to StrangerThis summer, Paul Simon brings his touring career to an end – 54 years after he thought it was over. When Simon and Garfunkel’s 1964 debut sank without a trace, the 24-year-old travelled to England, miserable and dejected, and shrugged out this solo album. Several tracks – including Kathy’s Song and I Am a Rock – now rank among his best-loved songs.Although there are overwrought moments on the duo’s third album (7 O’Clock NewsSilent Night is eerily pointed, but barely listenable) there are others of stark, dismal beauty – particularly the yearning ballad Homeward Bound, also written during Simon’s time in England.“Hope and dread,” Simon once said, “that’s the way I see the world.” The two states of mind clash fervently on his fourth solo album, a premature reflection on his regrets – he was only 34. Fifty Ways to Leave Your Lover, though, is deliciously silly.Although he must have the muscle memory to churn out a half-decent album without much effort, Simon has never done things by halves. On his lively 13th solo LP, he uses custom-made instruments, collaborates with Italian electronic artist Clap! Clap! and ruminates on the virtues of the word “motherfucker”.Kodachrome was banned from UK radio for its reference to a brand of film – a shame, because it is a brilliant, shiny pop song with bite. And there is plenty more to admire on Simon’s third solo album, particularly American Tune and St Judy’s Comet. “That may be my favourite album of the 70s,” he said. “It’s joyful.”After the failure of their 1964 debut, Wednesday Morning, 3am, Simon and Garfunkel’s career was shocked back to life by a new, electric version of that album’s The Sound of Silence. While the follow-up was hastily compiled, it was more assured than their debut, embracing a heftier folk-rock sound and showcasing Simon’s ability to dart between wit and desolation.There are a few intriguingly scruffy moments on Simon’s first post-Garfunkel album. On Everything Put Together Falls Apart, he turns from the microphone halfway through a line to scratch his beard, as if so deep in thought he has forgotten he is recording. It is fitting for an album of such candid introspection – although there are lighter moments, such as the samba-influenced Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard.Flitting from gentle guitars to brash, experimental Moog, Bookends is Simon and Garfunkel at their poppiest (Mrs Robinson, written for The Graduate), weirdest (Punky’s Dilemma) and most agitated (Fakin’ It). The standout, though, is America, a wistful, fruitless search for the land of the free.From the chaos of Simon and Garfunkel’s imploding relationship came the best album of their career. The gospel-influenced title track is now rightly ubiquitous, and The Only Living Boy in New York – written after Garfunkel flew off to star in a film from which Simon had been dumped – is the most beautiful display of passive aggression ever committed to music.Although initially mired in controversy – Simon worked on the album with local musicians in South Africa during apartheid, ignoring the UN’s boycott – this culturally collaborative masterpiece served as its own rebuttal. Inspired by a bootleg cassette of Mbaqanga music, Simon incorporated his own melodic style and storytelling skill into the sounds he had fallen in love with, recruiting Ladysmith Black Mambazo and the Gaza Sisters to realise his ambitious ideas. After the success of its lead single, the wonderfully peculiar You Can Call Me Al, the album took Simon’s career from its lowest point to its pinnacle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a5132f699a17a1bcddcd51984b6e631e4f0c6bd/36_487_4776_2865/master/4776.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8b6a9b87c04353def64f2e96cdfa9e3","title":"nevis how the worlds most secretive offshore haven refuses to clean up","story":"The years since 2008 have seen a global crackdown on offshore finance. Yet a few places have doubled down on offering secrecy to the super-rich. Among these, one tiny Caribbean island might be the worst offender. By  Oliver BulloughTax havens hate attention. Places such as Jersey, Switzerland and the British Virgin Islands made a handsome living from helping their clients break other countries’ laws for decades, without anyone really noticing. And they liked it that way. Then came the 2007-8 financial crisis, and the good times ended. Rich nations, angry over the loss to their budgets caused by tax dodging, put diplomatic pressure on the havens. Activists, furious over the theft of hundreds of billions of pounds from poor countries, exposed them in the press. The release of vast troves of confidential information – SwissLeaks, the HSBC files, the Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers – cemented a public perception that offshore financial centres exist to help the powerful dodge their obligations to the rest of us, and governments have queued up to punish them. In May, when Britain’s parliament voted to force transparency on its Caribbean islands, it was just the latest blow to the offshore havens.Although cooperating with outsiders in this way has proven expensive, the havens clearly concluded there was little choice. If denied access to the global financial system, or sanctioned by Brussels or Washington, an offshore centre could be put out of business altogether.This is good. Tax havens have helped the world’s wealthiest and most powerful keep a disproportionate share of the benefits of globalisation, by preventing the rest of us from seeing how much they own. This, in turn, has eroded trust in democracy and capitalism all over the world. Restricting the operations of tax havens, and enforcing true transparency on the ownership of property, is crucial if citizens are truly to take back control of their countries’ destinies.Yet, at the heart of this increasingly encouraging picture, there remain a few holdouts – places that have stuck to the old habit of keeping the secrets of the powerful. Foremost among them is Nevis, a solitary volcano in the Caribbean with a population of just 11,000, which has been implicated in some of the most sordid financial scams of modern times, from Britain’s biggest-ever tax fraud to the fleecing of 620,000 vulnerable Americans in a $220m payday loan scam. The story of Nevis reveals the difficulties the world faces in trying to put an end to tax evasion, fraud and kleptocracy.While Nevis’s rivals have lost business by opening up, Nevis has doubled down on secrecy. Not long ago, I spoke to a lawyer with extensive experience of the island, who asked not to be identified because he still needs to work with Nevisian officials. “The only good thing that Donald Trump could do, if he was ever so inclined,” he said, “is take a battleship and roll it up to Nevis, and literally train the guns and say: ‘Get rid of these bullshit laws or I’ll blow you to kingdom come.’”In short, he said, “A bright light needs to be shone on this cockroach.”Tax havens are often lumped together as if they all do the same job. In reality, they are distinctive and highly specialised predators in the financial shark tank. At the top of the food chain – as far as the western world goes, anyway – are places such as London, Switzerland and New York. These apex predators are surrounded by clouds of pilot fish that snap up the scraps: places such as Monaco, Jersey and the Cayman Islands.These smaller centres all play different aspects of the offshore game: Jersey specialises in trusts, the BVI in incorporation, Liechtenstein in foundations. They also differ in their tolerance for criminality. Among the British territories: Gibraltar is dodgier than Guernsey, but cleaner than Anguilla. And they serve different geographical regions: Mauritius for Africa and India Cyprus for the former Soviet Union the Bahamas for the US.In the world of offshore, Nevis is a bottom-feeder. It specialises in letting its clients create corporations with greater anonymity than almost anywhere else on earth. Last year, information on 70,000 Nevisian companies was leaked as part of the Paradise Papers investigation, but that didn’t help us find out who owns them: ownership information is so secret there that even the island’s own corporate registry doesn’t know. In other words, there was nothing substantial to leak.“We feel very strongly that people are entitled to some semblance of financial privacy,” the Nevis premier, Mark Brantley, himself an offshore lawyer, told me when we met in his office in January. “Why shouldn’t you be entitled to a secret?”The secrets don’t belong to residents of Nevis, of course: it would be hard to keep anything quiet for long on an island this size. The secrets belong to foreigners and are being kept from other foreigners, with Nevis getting paid to protect them.We can see that these secrets exist thanks to the UK’s Land Registry, which releases spreadsheets listing all offshore-owned property in the country, along with the registered address of the company that owns it. Some of the secrets are mundane and could be entirely innocent. For instance, who is behind Shi Li Gao Trustees Ltd, the Nevis-incorporated company that owns 13 Brunswick Gardens, a handsome terrace a short walk from Kensington Palace? Some of them are intriguing: for what reason would a Catholic primary school in Liverpool be held via this little Caribbean volcano? And some are decidedly weird: who on earth decided to structure their ownership of a room in a hotel on Llandudno’s North Parade through Caribbean Establishment LLC?But all of these questions are impossible to answer since the secrets are sealed away in Nevis. If these properties were owned via a British company, the true owner of that company would have to be declared to Companies House, and would be visible to anyone with access to the internet. If they were owned via a BVI company, that information would be available to the British police. But a Nevisian company is a closed book, and some people really like it that way.While the BVI has seen the number of companies created there each year collapse, the number created in Nevis has stayed stable. Since 2012, the island’s financial services sector has grown by more than a quarter, as people with secrets have moved to a place that still keeps them. That is a pretty good argument for Brantley’s government not to follow the BVI in opening up its corporate registries to foreigners. Secrecy pays.“The numbers are relatively small, compared to other financial services industries around, but bear in mind the size of Nevis,” Brantley said. “We get direct revenues of $5m-$5.5m, simply from renewal fees.” Renewal fees are what you pay to maintain your company’s registration the more companies there are, the more fees you get. “When that is extrapolated outwards – in terms of rental of office space, employment – we recognise that it does have a multiplier effect on the economy.”It is this provision of secrecy that makes Nevis such an obstacle to law-enforcement investigators. If police can’t prove who owns something, they can’t prove it was criminally acquired, say, or that tax was avoided on the profits from it. This is what crooks are looking for when they send their business offshore. Around 300 British properties are owned in Nevis, and Brantley was unrepentant in defending the secrecy his island provides to those properties’ owners.“Why should a bureaucrat in London, or wherever, curious about his neighbour’s financial situation, pick up the phone and say, ‘You know what, I need to know if Mr John Smith, who’s my neighbour down the road, has an account or a company in Nevis.’ Why’s that his business?” Brantley asked. “Why are Mr John Smith’s financial affairs any business of a bureaucrat in London, unless there’s an allegation against Mr John Smith that he’s somehow contravening some law somewhere?”It is an interesting philosophical question, but it is also a major problem. Countries recognise and respect each other’s laws and sovereignty, so Nevis corporations have as much international validity as anyone’s. So, as long as Nevis persists in denying foreigners access to the ownership information of its companies – no matter how hard other places work to open up – scoundrels can keep routing their business via Nevis, breaking the chain of traceable ownership, and hiding themselves and their crimes from discovery. That means crooked politicians, tax dodgers and fraudsters in Ukraine, Nigeria, Malaysia, the US or anywhere else get to mismanage their country’s finances for their own benefit.And, thanks to Nevis’s curious constitutional situation – it is neither an independent country nor can it be controlled by any other country – there doesn’t appear to be anything we can do about it.From the sea, Nevis (pronounced “knee-vis”) resembles a green nipple. It is elegantly symmetrical, a tropical volcano ringed with golden beaches. By surface area, it is roughly the same size as Bristol, yet its peak is taller than any mountain in England, so the whole island slopes upwards, starting gently where the beach bars shelter among the palm trees, then steadily steepening, while the tree cover gets denser. If you hike up the peak, you are in true rainforest, and will find yourself scrutinised by monkeys in the overhanging greenery.It is a gorgeous place, much frequented by famous people. Earlier this week, John Cleese told Newsnight he was so fed up with how Britain is run that he is moving to Nevis for good. “It’s one of the nicest islands I’ve ever been to,” he said. “The children and adults are extraordinarily well-educated, the weather’s good the whole time, I’m very lucky.”The island was once a major centre for Britain’s sugar growers and slave traders, but it slipped into obscurity in the 18th century, when it was out-competed by larger and more fertile rivals. In the 19th century, Britain added it to neighbouring St Kitts for administrative purposes, and it was as the junior half of the Federation of St Kitts and Nevis that it became independent in 1983.The 80s were a bonanza period for Caribbean islands, as the global economy opened up and law enforcement was caught flat-footed. Tax evaders and drug dealers from North and South America flew planeloads of dollar bills into places such as Cayman and Anguilla, stashed them in bank accounts owned by untraceable shell companies, then invested them in property in Florida, the south of France or New York.In 1984, Bill Barnard, an American lawyer who had taken to vacationing on Nevis, asked the island’s premier if he would be interested in getting into the offshore game. Thanks to the almost complete autonomy Nevis enjoys under the federal constitution of St Kitts and Nevis, its first premier, Simeon Daniel, was free to do what he liked. He approved Barnard’s suggestion, passed the incorporation and secrecy laws the American lawyer drafted and awarded Barnard’s company, Morning Star Holdings, the right to act as exclusive agent for creating the companies. It was a win for both of them. (Neither Morning Star Holdings nor Barnard wished to comment for this piece.)At first, Nevis struggled to compete with already-established rivals, partly because it had no particular advantage of its own. Barnard and his team of American lawyers had borrowed their legislation from Delaware, which acts as a sort of tax haven within the US by offering laxer regulations and lower taxes than the other states, so there wasn’t much reason to look to a remote island for products you could already buy elsewhere. “It was certainly successful,” says David Neufeld, a New Jersey lawyer and an expert on company structuring and international tax. “But it was never at the level of BVI or Cayman.”When Barnard’s monopoly expired in 1994, Nevis took the opportunity to reboot. Neufeld already worked with Barnard, and was asked to help Nevis ersify its offering. Tax havens are always borrowing ideas from each other, seeking to improve on laws that are proving popular – and this process has led to progressively greater secrecy, fewer taxes and lighter regulations. Neufeld looked to the USnited States for inspiration, and specifically to Wyoming, which had invented the limited liability company (LLC), a useful hybrid structure that allowed people to avoid identification and taxes at the same time, as well as offering other benefits.LLCs make it hard for your creditors to find your assets, which also helps rich people avoid paying damages if they lose a lawsuit. Your creditors may have a court judgment against you, but if they can’t find your stuff, they will settle for perhaps 50 cents on the dollar to get the legal wrangling over with. Lawyers call this asset protection.But in the US, it is hard to hide property, since courts can order disclosure of information. Handily, those courts have no jurisdiction in Nevis, which made the idea of a Caribbean version of the LLC very attractive. “In my mind, I was trying to create an LLC for the 51st state,” Neufeld told me. “If you see yourself as someone who could be exposed to some kind of predatory lawsuit where people feel you have assets that are exposed, this gives you an opportunity to protect that.”In simple terms, Nevis’s laws allow rich people to put ramparts around their property, to protect it from someone who might want to use the courts to take it away, whether that be a business partner, a spouse, an estranged child, or indeed anyone. All tax havens do this, but Nevis turned the ratchet many clicks further than its rivals, in its efforts to tempt business away from its rivals.To bring legal proceedings on Nevis, you have to file a bond of $100,000 with the court as proof that your case isn’t frivolous. If you win, that is only the beginning of your quest for the assets. Nevis’s regulator holds no information on either the ownership of the company or its assets. Nevis’s LLCs – Neufeld’s innovation – can’t be wound up, meaning you won’t be able to confiscate any assets they own, and you would have to seek redress elsewhere. If you seek to challenge the legality of a property being put in a Nevis-registered trust – for example, if you thought the property actually belonged to you – you have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the trust’s creation was fraudulent, and you would have to begin that legal challenge within a year of its creation. This is tricky, since Nevis law requires all information on the trust to be confidential, so you would be unlikely to know it even existed.These ludicrously formidable defences are not really intended to be used, but instead – like the bright colouring of a poisonous tree frog – they exist to warn you off attacking in the first place. If they can persuade a plaintiff to settle out of court for less than is owed, then, for a rich person with vulnerable assets, they are well worth paying for.“I don’t like the word ‘hidden’,” says Laurie Lawrence, who retired a couple of years ago after two decades as permanent secretary to the Nevis government. “It’s protected, not hidden. There’s nothing to hide. Look at it from the other way: a lot of females are gold-diggers. You are married to a man you don’t really love him, but he has money. People find ways and means to protect their assets.”This is perhaps why a wealthy person might want to own a Kensington house (or, indeed, a Llandudno hotel room) via a Nevisian company or other structure: it prevents a orced spouse, or any other creditor, from accessing that property, without a tortuous legal process. “Nevis structures started coming up about 12 years ago, and they’re coming around with increasing prevalence,” Jeffrey Fisher, one of America’s leading orce lawyers, told me by telephone from West Palm Beach in Florida.“I’m a former prosecutor, and I know about the ways people hide money, and what they’ll do,” said Fisher. “My approach to getting assets that are in asset protection entities like a Nevis LLC, is that you don’t go to Nevis and try to get the money out – that is a foolhardy enterprise. They passed laws and they set up structures to stop us and to make it expensive and to make it take years and years and years. What we do here is we use some more creative approaches to, for lack of a better term, make them cough up the dough.”Fisher’s approach is to target property and bank accounts in the US, to make his opponents’ lives so onerous that they eventually beg to settle – and he’s extremely good at it. The trouble is that anyone who cannot afford to employ highly expensive specialists such as Fisher has no prospect of even finding where their spouse has put their property, let alone wrestling a fair share away from them. They have to accept what they’re given – there’s no court that can help them.“You’ve got to realise that the asset protection industry is trillions of dollars, not billions of dollars, it’s trillions of dollars,” said Fisher. “Essentially, it’s: we’re going to find a way to screw legitimate creditors out of collecting a legitimate debt. That’s the business these people are in.”Brantley, the Nevis premier, is fluent and passionate in his defence of the ramparts that Nevis builds for rich people looking to protect their assets from creditors. “All it does is say that you’re creating a locked box, so to speak, if you want to protect assets,” Brantley said, when we met in his office up the hill from Charlestown, Nevis’s capital village. “And people protect assets for a variety of reasons. It’s not always to get away from a pending orce.”The trouble is that when you cast your eye beyond the orce cases, Nevis’s business model begins to looks even worse. The Nevis financial system is rudimentary compared to the large tax havens – places such as Jersey, or the Cayman Islands, which have major accountancy firms, fund managers, large banks and other global behemoths. In Nevis, there’s precious little money for anyone to avoid tax on. But then, it isn’t really a haven from taxes at all, so much as a haven from scrutiny of any kind. The same laws that appeal to the kind of nervous and wealthy men who want to hide their assets from their wives, have been regularly exploited by crooks from all over the world.Britain’s biggest-ever tax fraud – for which five men were jailed in November, after attempting to scam the Treasury out of £107m in tax – involved Nevis-registered companies, which were helping to hide the identity of the fraudsters. The family of a former president of Taiwan used a Nevis trust to help to hide its ownership of corruptly acquired US property. Ukraine’s deposed president, Viktor Yanukovych, used Nevis structures to hide his stolen assets, as did corrupt Russian officials who stole $230m from the budget in 2007. (When the accountant Sergei Magnitsky uncovered the scam, they arrested him and left him to die in jail.) British trader Navinder Sarao, who pleaded guilty to fraud for helping cause 2010’s flash crash, erted some of his profits to a Nevis structure called the NAV Sarao Milking Markets Fund.According to the independent advocacy group Tax Justice Network, Nevis out-obscures all the traditional offshore centres: BVI, Switzerland, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Luxembourg, and even fellow bottom-feeders such as Belize and the Cook Islands. And its enthusiasm for secrets impedes other countries’ efforts to enforce transparency.But a search of the Companies House website reveals how Nevis is able to defang Britain’s attack on secrecy. For instance, I recently came across three LLPs, all of which are owned by the same two Nevis companies: Tallberg and Uniwell. According to data gathered by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, one of these LLPs controlled a Latvian bank account used in a money-laundering scheme the other two have not been implicated in any wrongdoing (and neither have Tallberg and Uniwell). According to Companies House, the three LLPs have the same ownership structure, which means that their person or persons with significant control should be the same. Mysteriously, however, each of the LLPs is listed as having a different PSC. This is technically possible, but highly unlikely. But we have no way of finding out the truth, since Nevis does not cooperate with the UK in allowing law enforcement officers to see who really owns Nevisian companies such as Tallberg and Uniwell. These three LLPs are not isolated examples – Tallberg and Uniwell alone have owned dozens of British companies, and there are many more Nevisian corporations like them.The new UK law requiring disclosure of true owners is useless if that ownership can just be hidden in Nevis. And this is why Nevis-controlled but British-registered companies, whose ownership is unclear, have been involved in many of the massive eastern European money-laundering scams collectively known as the “laundromats”, which have moved tens of billions of dollars out of the former Soviet Union. Nevis ownership can transform a supposedly transparent British company into a secrecy vehicle as iniquitous as anything on earth.Charlestown is a handsome place, consisting of a long street of two-storey buildings parallel to the shore, many with first-floor balconies for catching the sea breeze. Its most striking feature, however, is the truly remarkable number of signs advertising lawyers, accountants and administrators. The Devon town of Ilfracombe, with its 11,000 inhabitants, has two lawyers’ offices, an insurance company and two sets of accountants, as well as a branch of Lloyds and a Nationwide. The 11,000 Nevisians, by contrast, host six domestic banks, one international bank, 18 insurance managers, seven international insurance entities, four money service businesses and 58 registered agents, many of them law firms. Nevis may be the most over-lawyered place on earth.When you get off the ferry, almost the first house you see is the Henville building, nominal home to the Azerbaijan first family’s business empire. If you then turn right at the T-junction, you see the Edith Solomon building (although it has lost two of the letters from its name), which hosted an Idaho payday loan company that was shut down by the state government in 2012, for operating without a license. Barely 100 metres in the opposite direction on Main Street, meanwhile, is the office of Morning Star Holdings, pioneers of the Nevis offshore industry.I was keen to find the registered address of Tallberg and Uniwell, the two Nevisian companies that had so successfully outmanoeuvred UK company law, in the – admittedly, rather forlorn – hope that I could find someone who would give me information about them. Their registered address was the same as that of the Nevis International Trust Company (NITC), which, according to its website, will supply you not only with a shell company, but also with nominee directors and shareholders, which will further obscure your involvement in it, as well as a bank account, a credit card and a stock trading account. “Nevis is an excellent location for: privacy, estate planning, asset protection, tax reduction planning, holding investments, royalty and licensing ownership,” the website states.I had an address for the NITC’s office, but no one on the island was able to tell me where it was. I spent a frustrating, hot and thirsty morning searching for it and, when I finally got through on the phone, was brushed off. “I’m not a robber,” I told the woman who answered the phone, after she had refused to help me. “I don’t know that, do I?” she replied.In fairness, she had a good reason not to talk. According to a 1985 law, anyone on Nevis disclosing financial information without a court order is liable to a prison term of up to a year, as well as a fine of $10,000. (This is another area where Nevis is resisting the trend towards openness. Cayman previously had a similar law against breaching confidentiality, but decriminalised the offence in 2016.) When I tried phoning the registered office of Tallberg and Uniwell, the receptionist refused to even tell me where the office was, so I couldn’t visit. When I emailed the NITC, there was no reply. Eventually I had to accept that it was not going to be possible to make contact with them, which meant the true ownership information for the three LLPs was undiscoverable.And it is not just journalists who are unable to check the reliability of Nevis’ financial information for themselves foreign police can’t either. That means we are all reliant on the Nevis financial services regulatory commission to do it for us. The commission is based in an office in the centre of Charlestown, and is run by Heidi-Lynn Sutton, its chief regulator, who works in an office on the first floor.Sutton started off unfriendly, and became less friendly as our 45-minute chat progressed, her manner becoming increasingly exasperated. She flatly dismissed the US state department’s description of Nevis as “a desirable location for criminals to conceal proceeds”. It was simply untrue, she said, that Nevis had anonymous bank accounts, bank secrecy and an opaque corporate register.This was odd, since her regulator’s own website states that bank account holders on the island have no obligation to provide any “statement, return or information (to) … the regulator or the minister”. However, Sutton defended Nevis against all allegations, no matter how serious. The heavy cost of bringing proceedings in Nevis court, for example, was simply to protect the justice system from being “bombarded with frivolous lawsuits”, rather than to protect the wealthy. “That is our weeding-out mechanism,” she said. “Some countries are very litigious. If you get a little burn on your hand because you spill a McDonald’s coffee, somebody will sue you.”When I explained the difficulty I had faced in even finding NITC, Sutton laughed, asking why I was looking for it. I explained that I had hoped to discover who actually owned the limited partnerships on the British registry. When I asked about whether the regulator she runs might have failed to notice a number of serious money-laundering schemes, she simply said: “I can’t speak to that, I really cannot speak to that.”What about the fact that the former ruling families of Taiwan and Ukraine, as well as lower-profile crooks from all over the world, had used Nevis vehicles to obscure the ownership of their stolen assets? Sutton laughed again. “I can’t accept that there has been multiple usage of our structures to facilitate whatever. I can’t accept hearing it from you. I won’t be able to speak to that.”If the island is so clean, why did online trolls looking to smear Emmanuel Macron before the 2017 French presidential election create fake documents supposedly showing he had a shell company in Nevis? Isn’t that a sign that the industry Sutton oversees has an image problem? “People make things up all the time,” she replied. “Once you are an international financial centre, and provide certain services, you will always be a target, it doesn’t mean that it’s true.”I have spent most of the last four years researching financial crimes, and have spoken to dozens of regulators and investigators in multiple jurisdictions, but never before had I met one who responded in such a way to allegations of grand corruption, money laundering and fraud that I was making against their jurisdiction.Like any financial centre, Nevis must choose between turning away dirty money, or attracting as much business as it can. I did not find my visit to Nevis reassuring.Since Nevisian officials appear happy with the current situation, it is up to outsiders to force change on the island, and sadly – thanks to the constitutional peculiarities of the federation – this is all but impossible. We know this because it has been tried.In 1995, in federation-wide elections, the St Kitts and Nevis Labour party swept to power with seven of the 11 federal seats, and its leader, Denzil Douglas, became prime minister. He had no seats on Nevis, but did not need any to pass laws for the whole federation. Among his priorities was restricting Nevis’ sordid financial sector. “We were aware that the international community had begun to frown upon Nevis, and on the international financial services that were poorly regulated, not supervised, etc,” said Douglas when we met in his office in Basseterre, the federal capital, which is on St Kitts. “And we sought to bring in new legislation. So they had their referendum.”In 2000, the Financial Action Task Force – a Paris-based group created by the G7 to develop policies against money-laundering – blacklisted the whole of St Kitts and Nevis, as one of 15 countries deemed to be non-cooperative. That forced Nevis to agree to federal legislation, but did not change the basic dynamic that it has significantly more autonomy than Scotland has within the UK, and in some ways more than inidual US states. One financial professional in Basseterre described the relationship between Nevis and St Kitts as like that of a teenager with access to his big brother’s credit card.None of the tools that large countries have used against tax havens such as Switzerland or Jersey – diplomatic pressure, legal proceedings against banks, and so on – are applicable to Nevis. It is part of a fully independent country (unlike the BVI or Gibraltar) and the companies providing its services (unlike the Swiss banks targeted by the US Department of Justice) are not large enough to fear losing their offices in the US.Major western countries will have to make their criticism of Nevis via diplomatic channels, if they want it to change its ways. Brantley got his retaliation in first, however, accusing the British government of hypocrisy.“It is no secret that the UK, and London in particular, has a disproportionate number of wealthy Russians, for example, and wealthy oligarchs from all around the world, and the question is: why? It can’t be for the weather. So, why are people flocking to London? So, if the United Kingdom can do that, then what is the issue with other countries, not as endowed as the UK, trying to stand on their own two feet?”The issue is that if every jurisdiction thinks only of how to stand on its own two feet – whether that’s post-Brexit Britain, Nevis or Wyoming – we will all be pushed over separately by the world’s crooks and thieves. Brantley is right that we all need to do more to fight kleptocrats and fraudsters, but by keeping their secrets and making money from it, Nevis is stopping the rest of us from moving forward.• This article was amended on 12 July 2018 to correct an error. An earlier version stated that it was impossible for the three LLPs mentioned in the text to have three different persons with significant control. It is, in fact, technically possible. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c17d557aa5ead5d24e18c6775b1324de4d8b33c7/0_168_5160_3096/master/5160.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f319452896a8a1f38170afa03027e2a3","title":"poles apart the bitter conflict over a nations history poland monuments communism soviet union","story":"Many Poles remember Soviet soldiers saving them from Nazi occupation. But a growing number are rejecting that narrative, and the monuments that come with it. In September 2013, the Polish city of Legnica was preparing to host a reunion of former Soviet officers who had served in the city and left after the Soviet Union fell. The centrepiece of the celebrations would be a monument in the main square showing two soldiers, a Pole and a Russian, locked in a handshake on their shoulders sat a small girl, her gaze fixed on the Russian. When it was unveiled in 1951, the monument had been described in the local press as an expression of the Polish people’s “limitless gratitude to their liberators”, of “inseparability and eternal friendship with the Soviet Union”.In the middle of the night before the reunion event, Piotr Borodacz, a 25-year-old Polish nationalist, gathered with several friends on the square and doused the “monument of gratitude” in red paint. On its base, they scrawled the symbol of the National Radical Camp, a Polish prewar fascist movement that was resurrected after the fall of communism. Red was the colour of the communism Borodacz despised, and of the blood of Poles persecuted by the communist regime.Hours later, Borodacz stood beside the defaced monument to address a nationalist rally. “They told us that the Soviets are a brother nation,” he said to about 100 supporters. “And today, in the name of unity, they tell us to play with the butchers at a feast, to call our occupiers friends.” Waving Polish flags and banners of the far-right All-Polish Youth, the protestors marched through town, congregating before a stage on which a folk band was performing songs for the reunion event. “From trees, instead of leaves, communists will be hanging,” they chanted, drowning out the music.At 6am the following day, police officers stormed into Borodacz’s apartment. He was handcuffed and driven to the police station, held for 48 hours and ordered to pay for the monument to be cleaned. His laptop, camera and mobile phone were confiscated. For the next four days, as festivities continued and Russian pop bands were welcomed into town, police stood watch beside the vandalised statue.That was a different time in Poland. Two years later, in 2015, Law and Justice (PiS) was elected with the first outright parliamentary majority in the country’s post-communist history. Since then, the nationalist party has seized control of state media and portrayed Poland as a country assailed by malign outside forces. It has announced a political revolution aimed at wiping out the corrosive influence of the venal communist collaborators it accuses of seizing power when Poland regained independence in 1989. And it has mounted a campaign to erase the communist legacy entirely, ridding Poland’s streets of the names of former communists, and its squares and roundabouts of the hundreds of “monuments of gratitude” put up for the 600,000 Soviet soldiers estimated to have died fighting the Nazis on Polish territory. In communist times, these soldiers were seen as liberators. Today, the totalitarian regime whose uniforms they wore is being equated with Nazi occupation.That narrative has helped revive a story of Polish defiance and heroism at a time when many see their national identity threatened by the forces of globalisation. But it also taps into a well of historical pain and animosity, reigniting conflicts that have lain dormant for years. The Soviet Union liberated Poland from the Nazis, opening the gates of concentration camps and freeing thousands of Jews. But it brought with it a communist system that crushed all domestic opposition, executed leaders of the wartime resistance and imposed a totalitarian order aimed at indoctrinating successive generations with unquestioning gratitude towards the USSR. For millions of Poles, 1945 brought a new occupation under a different name for others, it brought salvation and social advancement.Legnica, a small city near the German border, is a microcosm of that rift. After the Red Army swept across the region in 1945, driving German troops back towards Berlin, the city became known as Little Moscow, the largest of several dozen Soviet bases constructed along Poland’s western border. Some residents recall acts of kindness by Soviet officers or enduring friendships with their wives others, like Borodacz, want all traces of that period destroyed. The last Soviet soldier departed Legnica in 1993 but the monument of gratitude remained, inflaming isions in a community riven by its postwar past.This November, Poland will celebrate the centenary of its rebirth as a state in 1918, which followed more than a century of partition by imperial powers. Law and Justice has heralded the inception of a new Polish state shorn of all relics of communist rule, and a new set of anti-Soviet heroes is now being placed on pedestals.Russia is incensed. It accuses Poland of violating mutual cooperation treaties signed in the 1990s that guarantee the protection and upkeep of historical sites. But while the Kremlin warns of retaliation, Law and Justice is forging ahead.In March this year, Legnica’s most isive landmark was dismantled. Borodacz, who had been arrested for defacing it just five years earlier, stood on the main square to celebrate what he sees as a resurgent Poland exorcising the ghosts of its past. But the toppling of monuments is only the most visible part of the battle that Poland is waging over its identity as a nation, amid a resurgent nationalism that is pitting its government against the European Union and endangering the country’s EU membership. Increasingly, this battle is setting Pole against Pole.One evening in August 2014, Kinga Zazulak, a Polish amateur historian, was browsing the web in her Wrocław apartment when an article caught her attention. A Red Army monument in the nearby town of Mikolin had fallen into disrepair, she read, and authorities were debating its demolition. In the days that followed, she wondered what she could do to help save the monument – a towering obelisk topped with a Soviet red star. She happened upon the Facebook page of Kursk, a Polish non-profit organisation that renovates Soviet monuments and cemeteries, and sent a message to Jerzy Tyc, Kursk’s director, asking if there was anything he could do. Tyc promptly replied, promising he would look into it.As a former soldier in the communist Polish People’s Army and an avowed socialist, Tyc laments the erosion of Poland’s Soviet-era heritage. A mild-mannered man with a receding hairline, he retains, at 50, a profound loyalty to the Red Army, who saved his mother and her family from the Nazis. Army service has left its imprint on this working-class Pole: he speaks in military jargon, calls himself Kursk’s “commander” and dons his old army uniform to unveil each new cemetery and monument he has repaired. He is driven by a nostalgia for the past, for the sense of security he felt as part of a powerful, Soviet-led military bloc.The pace of his life is frantic. He is constantly on the road, traversing the length and breadth of Poland in his small grey Citroën, visiting dilapidated monuments and cemeteries and meeting local officials to request permission to restore them. But every so often, Tyc retreats for days on end to the tranquility of Surmówka, the village in northern Poland where he grew up, and where he and his younger brother Adam, one of his five siblings, run a 20-hectare farm and keep bees. It is here that, as children, Tyc and his friends would build wooden guns, dress up as Red Army soldiers and play war. At 18, he was able to fulfil his dream and join the army, a place where he developed the deep distrust towards the west that he still feels today.Tyc launched Kursk in 2008, in a bid to repair several abandoned communist-era bunkers near Katowice. He named the organisation after the Russian city where the largest tank battle of the second world war took place. Over the past decade, he has renovated more than 40 Red Army monuments with approval from local authorities, to whom he files a request prior to purchasing the necessary materials and drawing up plans. He has secured the backing of powerful figures in the Russian government and a regular stream of donations, including from charities close to the Kremlin. He has also become a regular on Russian state media, which portrays him as an ordinary Pole fighting historical revisionism in the face of an uncompromising government.Tyc regularly travels to Moscow, driving through Lithuania and Latvia. It is a long journey – 18 hours, with stops to nap in the back seat – but it saves money and allows him to meet sponsors and veterans’ associations, and call on the many Russians who contact him via social media for information about relatives lost in the war. In 2016, a Russian TV journalist, Anna Zakharian, reached out to to Tyc for help locating the grave of her grandfather who went missing in Poland. The two connected over a common respect for the Red Army. They became a couple, and Zakharian is now the official representative of Kursk in Russia.When he heard about the Mikolin monument, Tyc contacted local authorities and secured permission to begin work. But this renovation posed a particular challenge. Trees had sprouted through the cement base, allowing rainwater to seep through the cracks, freezing in winter months and breaking through its foundation. The stairs leading to the 20-metre obelisk, exposed for years to the elements, were disintegrating.The project took two years and cost 20,000 złoty (£4,000). Helped by volunteers from across Poland, Tyc ripped out the weeds, repaved the stairs, laid new insulation, repaired the road leading to the monument and repainted the red star that crowns it. He unveiled the renovated monument at a ceremony on 22 June 2017, the 76th anniversary of Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union. Soviet war songs played as a light breeze swayed two flags – Polish and Russian – mounted high. Members of the Russian diplomatic mission watched on. “You know, dear Russian friends, that we will never forget what your people did for our nation,” Tyc said in heavily accented Russian. “That your people, at the cost of their blood, returned our country, Poland, to the map and returned to Polish territory the lands we stand on today.”But even as he spoke, Tyc knew his work had likely been in vain. Law and Justice had been in power almost two years. Railing against the communist collaborators the party accuses of stalling Poland’s transition from communism, it had announced the abolition of the Third Republic, the independent Polish state inaugurated in 1989. The decommunisation Poland never completed would pave the way for a new Fourth Republic cleansed of all vestiges of Soviet power. This meant all reminders of that hated system had to disappear.That same morning, as Tyc prepared to address the crowd in his People’s Army uniform, the Polish parliament passed legislation banning “the propagation of communism or any other totalitarian system”. It ordered the removal of all monuments of gratitude to the Soviets, except those on cemetery grounds. The newly restored statue in Mikolin was one of those slated to go.The monuments of gratitude are the most conspicuous reminders of communism. Over more than four decades, hundreds were erected in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and the Baltic states, part of a campaign to entrench the narrative of friendship with the USSR and popularise the liberation myth. In Poland, the vast majority emerged in the first five years after the war, but their construction continued until the final years of communist rule. Some depict the brotherhood of Polish and Soviet soldiers, shown surging forward to battle side by side. Others feature a lone soldier, sometimes a celebrated Red Army hero, with clenched fists and a steely gaze. The inscription, usually in both Russian and Polish, praises the sacrifice of the Red Army, with no mention of the rape and looting that sometimes accompanied its westward advance or the postwar subjugation of the countries it liberated.The monuments have served as something on to which Poles could project their thoughts and feelings about the turbulent changes of the past decades. They have provided a backdrop for dates and wedding celebrations, concerts and flashmobs, nationalist demonstrations and anti-Soviet rallies. In 1956, as Red Army troops entered communist Hungary to suppress an anti-Soviet uprising, they became the setting for mass protests against Soviet domination. By the late 1980s, when communist rule began unravelling, details behind some of the 20th century’s darkest episodes were coming to light. For Poles, none was starker than the 1940 massacre of more than 20,000 members of the Polish elite in Katyn and surrounding regions, including almost half the country’s officer corps. In 1990, after decades of denial, Moscow finally admitted responsibility for the atrocity.At that time, a wave of iconoclasm was sweeping Poland. Streets and squares were renamed and monuments were defaced or toppled. Across the country, empty plinths became metaphors for a vanquished regime. However, that process was stalled by local opposition and reluctance to spark conflict. According to historian Dominika Czarnecka, who has documented Poland’s decommunisation, fewer than a third of the monuments of gratitude had been dismantled by 2012. Many were shorn of their red stars and their hammer and sickle, or moved to cemeteries. Others were repurposed or rededicated to alternative heroes, but most remained intact. In February 1994, Poland and Russia signed an agreement to protect and maintain graves and “places of memory” on each other’s territory. A joint commission drew up a list of objects in Poland dedicated to fallen Soviet soldiers – it included 415 monuments and 77 obelisks, but excluded the hundreds standing on cemetery grounds.By the late 1990s, public attention had shifted to the political and economic transformation required for membership of the EU, which Poland joined in 2004. Following its narrow victory in the 2005 election, Law and Justice proposed legislation to remove the monuments, but the bill didn’t pass. After the party’s re-election three years ago, a pliant parliament overwhelmingly backed the law. Taken together with other controversial moves – a purge of Poland’s supreme court, a campaign against abortion, rejection of the EU’s migrant quotas and deepening state ties with Poland’s powerful Catholic church – it amounts to what critics decry as a nationalist volte-face in a country long celebrated as a success story of the post-communist transition.The decommunisation law is being enforced by the Institute of National Remembrance, or IPN, a government-run commission launched in 1998 to document crimes committed against Poles during the periods of Nazi occupation and Soviet domination. Since Law and Justice assumed power, IPN’s budget has risen every year, dwarfing that of the Polish Academy of Sciences. From a nondescript business centre in Warsaw’s Mokotów district, it presides over a nationwide network of regional branches that organise conferences, screenings, exhibitions, concerts and social media campaigns, all directed, since 2015, towards the promotion of a positive version of Polish history.IPN is the spearhead of Law and Justice’s counter-offensive against perceived historical myths peddled about Poland from abroad, from references to Nazi concentration camps as “Polish death camps” to claims about instances of Polish complicity in the Holocaust, aggressively disputed by the current government. The institute is tasked with injecting into Poles a sense of pride about their history and a willingness to stand up and defend it against any effort to undermine the country’s heroic past. In the Law and Justice lexicon, this is called “historical politics”. IPN’s director, Jarosław Szarek, describes its aim as “showing the historical heritage that our predecessors have created, showing it in a modern form, transmitting it to the young generation, shaping views on history”. Many Poles believes their country would be at the level of the world’s most developed economies if it had escaped Nazi and Soviet subjugation. Critics say highlighting past crimes against Poland helps justify mistakes in the present.After the fall of communism in eastern Europe, the newly independent states sought legitimacy in a break with the postwar past, turning to the second world war for tales of heroism and defiance that could provide a basis for patriotism. Wartime nationalist movements such as the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, the Latvian Legion or the Polish National Armed Forces were revived. In Poland, Law and Justice is championing a set of heroes that were suppressed and silenced under communist rule. In the place of communist monuments, new state-approved murals and memorials are appearing across the country: to those Polish generals who died at the hands of the Nazi and Soviet occupiers, and, increasingly, to the “cursed soldiers”, a motley crew of resistance fighters from the Home Army and other underground movements, who waged a protracted struggle against communist authorities until the early 1960s. A decade ago, these men and women were rarely discussed today their names form a key part of the foundation myth Law and Justice is forging for Poland.I arrived in Legnica in late March, three days before the monument of the two soldiers and the little girl was dismantled. The area around it had been fenced off, and workers in fluorescent overalls unloaded equipment from a van. Passersby slowed their step and exchanged comments or took pictures. In the basement office of a small accounting firm – a few steps from the former Soviet Officers’ House, which is now a Catholic seminary – I met Piotr Borodacz, the young nationalist, his 17-year-old sister, Julia, and his father, Artur. In the driveway stood Artur’s gleaming black Chrysler. Embossed on the bumper were the words “we remember” and the logo of the Polish Home Army. On the steering wheel was a white eagle on a red background, the emblem of the far-right National Movement, whose local chapter Artur runs. The political party unites under one umbrella the National Radical Camp, the All-Polish Youth and other far-right movements with roots in prewar Poland.This family is energised by a sense of vindication. The election of Law and Justice has validated its years-long grassroots campaign to instill Polish pride and nationalism locally. For years, Artur has arranged rallies in Legnica and lectures by historians sympathetic to the nationalist cause. His own family had been exiled to Siberia in cattle trains during the war, along with hundreds of thousands of Poles. Today, they and other heroes Artur and Piotr revere are being revived with new monuments and education campaigns. The past for which they hanker is a past mythologised, a past of Polish traditions, of Polish pride, of Polish heroism. And their desire to defend those myths comes at a time when European unity is strained by an influx of migrants that the Borodacz family considers a threat to Polish identity on a par with collective amnesia about the past.Last November, Borodacz stood shoulder-to-shoulder in Warsaw with 60,000 fellow Poles – from moderate Law and Justice supporters to football hooligans and neo-Nazis – in the largest Independence Day march since its inception in 2010. The march commemorates the day in 1918 when Poland regained statehood after 123 years of partition between the German, Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires. Polish state media, reorganised under Law and Justice into a platform for official propaganda, has promoted the event as a rally of patriots. It used to be a fringe gathering of Poland’s extreme-right, but this year, on the 100th anniversary of Poland’s independence, the event is expected to go mainstream.I asked Piotr if he would get arrested today for the kind of vandalism that got him jailed in 2013. In response, he offered an example. On 11 November each year since 2010, he and his father have organised a bus trip for National Movement supporters to the Independence Day march in Warsaw. For the first few years, the bus would be stopped en route and searched by police officers, he said. At the march, masked men would appear seemingly out of nowhere and begin hurling rocks at the police, who would respond with teargas to scatter the marchers. “Then Law and Justice came to power,” he says. “And all of that suddenly stopped.”In April, I met Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for the Russian foreign ministry, in an annex of its hulking gothic skyscraper in Moscow. Zakharova has emerged as the most prominent defender of Russia’s second world war legacy. Nearly a month had passed since the poisoning of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, and she had just delivered a blistering public tirade against Britain’s charges of Russian complicity.The way she saw it, the Skripal case fitted into the west’s centuries-long campaign to weaken Russia, which includes a drive to undermine its role in the victory over fascism. The Soviet Union lost more than 26 million people in that war no family was left unaffected. Today, the “Great Patriotic War”, as Russians call it, is the pillar of the national narrative, even as its core premise – Europe’s liberation by the Soviet Union – is being assailed across the former communist bloc. “It’s not for Poland to tell us what damage communism caused. Our people went through civil war, through destitution, through dispossession, through the executions of the 1920s. Our literature describes far better than any Polish propaganda all the fear and horror of that time,” Zakharova told me. “We understand all that. And we have no doubt that there are people who want no further communist experiments till the end of time.”As a child, Zakharova spent weekends at her grandmother’s dacha outside Moscow. The highway there is flanked by dozens of monuments to those who fell defending the capital in 1941, when Nazi forces came within 18 miles of the Kremlin: stone faces etched into granite blocs, towering limestone obelisks shaped like bayonets, mothers bent over dying sons, and many, many eternal flames.Zakharova would watch newlyweds lay flowers beneath the monuments and marvel at the bouquets protruding from the westward-facing guns of decorative T-34 tanks sitting high atop plinths, wondering how those bouquets had got there. Decades later, the symbolism still awes her: young people celebrating new beginnings with the memory of those who had made it possible. As she grew older, the highway was widened. New shops, cafes and petrol stations sprouted up. But, as time passed and other things changed, the monuments were left untouched. Zakharova came to see them as a sacred part of the landscape.Today, she advances this perspective during her weekly press briefings at the ministry. In October 2016, after another monument in Poland was taken down, Zakharova denounced “Warsaw’s complete disdain for norms of behaviour accepted in civilised society”. Then she broke into a smile. Moscow would receive a visit from Tyc, she announced, and Zakharova would personally greet him. That Sunday, she drove Tyc and his Kursk colleagues along that same highway to the family dacha she would frequent as a child. She treated them to homemade apple pie while her uncle laid out the second world war-era helmets, bullets and shrapnel he had unearthed in the crater-strewn garden. Tyc gave Zakharova a star-shaped Russian tricolor sewn by his mother, who, he told her, has been grateful her whole life to the Red Army soldiers who saved her from the Nazis.There’s little the Russian side can do to thwart’s Poland’s efforts to dismantle the monuments of gratitude, Zakharova says, other than send letters of protest and mount legal campaigns, citing agreements such as the 1994 treaty on graves and places of memory. Russia has accused Poland of repeatedly violating that agreement, most notably last September, when IPN ordered the demolition of a commemorative mausoleum in the town of Trzcianka, where the remains of 56 soldiers had been buried. Poland says the remains were exhumed and interred at a local cemetery decades ago. Moscow contests that claim, and a legal dispute continues.Russia is also using the full force of its formidable media machine, which broadcasts in several languages across the former socialist bloc. On 17 July 2017, the same day Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, signed the decommunisation project into law, Russia’s defence ministry launched an online project titled The Liberation of Poland: the Price of Victory, which features scans of wartime reports from Soviet officers and Polish communists citing widespread gratitude among Poles towards the Red Army. A preamble introduces the documents as evidence of the Polish nation’s “promises to immortalise the feats of Red Army soldiers with monuments and memorials, and pass on a call to care for them to future generations”.Zakharova sees decommunisation as betrayal. She acknowledges the crimes of the Soviet regime – the brutal expropriations that followed the 1917 revolution, the Stalinist repressions, the wartime massacre of the Polish elite – but believes eastern Europe’s liberation from fascism stands apart. “Those soldiers did indeed have red stars, they lived in a country that was building communism. But they were fighting fascism. And when I hear from Polish colleagues, ‘your soldiers didn’t bring us freedom’, I say, ‘perhaps’, and I’m even prepared to agree with that. But our soldiers brought them life.”In April 2007, the former Soviet republic of Estonia decided to relocate a monument of gratitude out of the centre of its capital city, Tallinn. The bronze statue depicts a pensive soldier with his head bowed, one hand holding a helmet and the other curled into a fist. For Estonia’s sizeable Russian minority, it was a symbol of the country’s liberation from fascism by the Red Army. For many Estonians, it was a reminder of the country’s occupation by the Soviet Union. On 26 April, as authorities cordoned off the monument in preparation for its removal, hundreds of ethnic Russians descended on the area. They began charging a line of police officers, who responded with teargas. Over the next three days, riots swept across Estonia in the worst case of unrest the tiny Baltic state had seen since the second world war. Shops were looted, bus stops vandalised and roads dug up. One man died from stab wounds and 100 others were injured. A massive wave of cyber-attacks coincided with the riots, crippling government institutions.There is unlikely to be a repeat of such violence in Poland. The country’s small Russian community has little influence, and can still pay homage to its own heroes undisturbed. On 9 May, its members gathered at the Soviet military cemetery in Warsaw, where an estimated 22,000 Red Army soldiers lie buried. Holding photos of relatives killed in the war, as millions of their compatriots do on this day, they walked forward to lay flowers at the foot of an obelisk topped with a red star. Sergei Andreev, Russia’s ambassador to Poland, looked on.A few days later, I sat down with Andreev below the palatial ceilings and crystal chandeliers of the Russian embassy, which commands a four-hectare site close to the city centre. As I ascended the steps to the vast wooden doors of the embassy, the curtains were drawn. Black cars lined the drives. Inside the splendid, cavernous halls, an eerie silence prevailed. Four staff members had recently left, expelled by Poland in solidarity with the UK over the Skripal affair.Andreev was defiant. “Poland and the Polish nation exist today on this land thanks to the Red Army’s victory in that war, at the cost of the lives of those 600,000 soldiers and officers who died here,” he told me. “Those monuments are to them.” On the wall of his office hung photos of a grandfather who died in the war and two grandparents who survived it. “This is a foreign country, and we cannot lay down the law here. But one thing is clear,” he said. “We will not forget this, and we will not forgive.”In the meantime, Law and Justice is pressing on with its decommunisation campaign. Almost weekly, crowds gather in Poland’s towns and cities to watch a local communist landmark dismantled. In rare instances, grassroots opposition has forced the authorities to compromise. In Mikolin, the imposing obelisk that Tyc renovated still stands. It may lose its red star and commemorative inscriptions to appease Law and Justice, which would help save it, for now.In late May, I joined Tyc in Dąbrowa Górnicza, an industrial town of 120,000 and home to Poland’s emasculated communist party. Tyc had rented a crane truck and had come to haul away several of the Red Army monuments erected across this region during the communist era, all of which were slated for removal. Fresh from an appearance as part of a Russian delegation at the UN headquarters in Geneva, he was stepping up his campaign. In Surmówka, his home village, he was realising a long-held ambition: an open-air display of the monuments he had saved from destruction, in the form of an “educational park” for local kids. He has salvaged about a dozen so far, from across Poland – they are now strewn across a small field outside Tyc’s farm, waiting to be raised up again.When I met him that morning, Tyc was trying to fix on to his nose a pair of spectacles with one arm snapped off. He was unshaven and had barely slept. Two weeks previously, police had interrupted a conference at Szczecin University timed to coincide with the 200th anniversary of Karl Marx’s birth. Officers had been tipped off that the scholarly gathering may be “propagating fascism or another totalitarian system” – a violation of the new law on decommunisation punishable by a maximum two-year jail sentence. Tyc’s main sponsor had subsequently pulled out, citing the hostile climate. Tyc had scraped together enough money to haul away two more monuments, but he could feel the screws tightening.In this toxic atmosphere, Kursk was being scrutinised and its Russian affiliates targeted. On 17 May, Polish border security officers had detained Tyc’s girlfriend, Zakharian, near the Czech border, where she and Tyc were visiting a mutual friend. After seven days in police custody, she was deported to Russia. In a statement, the spokesman for ABW, Poland’s internal security service, said Zakharian and three other Russians were trying to consolidate pro-Russian groups in Poland in a bid to promote Russia’s version of history and “obstruct the historical politics advanced by the Polish state”. Another Kursk associate and longtime resident of Poland was also deported. “This is a woman I connect my future with,” Tyc told me. He had hoped Zakharian would move to Poland to help him create his “educational park” in Surmówka. Now, she was on a blacklist and banned from returning.None of this had gone unnoticed in Dąbrowa Górnicza. Photoshopped images of Tyc had surfaced on local forums. One featured his face on a “most wanted” poster from the video game franchise Grand Theft Auto, citing “assault with a deadly weapon” another showed what looked like a Soviet navy ID carrying his photograph. A widely shared post carried the exact date and time of his visit and the words: “See a Russian spy with your own eyes!”When we pulled up beside the first monument, a small obelisk beside a residential block, a small crowd was already waiting. Several men with Polish flags on their lapels stood next to another man operating a camera on a tripod. From the balconies above, curious residents looked out. The men began heckling Tyc as soon as he stepped out of his car. “Where do you get your money?!” they shouted. “You’re spitting on your nation!” “Stalin created Hitler!”Tyc paid little attention as he wrapped a rope around the obelisk and attached it to the arm of the crane truck, while a young man with a baseball cap on backwards, who operated the remote control, looked confused by the whole spectacle.Once the work was done, Tyc turned to face his opponents. One of the men thrust a handheld camera in his face and asked him how he dare honour Poland’s bloody occupiers. “My uncle was a soldier in the Home Army. In 1943, he was imprisoned in Dachau and survived. In 1945, he returned to his family and two sons. In 1946, he was murdered by the communist secret police. So what monuments?” he demanded. Tyc responded calmly: “In 1945, my entire village, including my mother, who was then 13, was rescued from Nazi occupation by Soviet soldiers. She told me: ‘You must respect this army, it saved us.’”The heated exchange lasted some 20 minutes. Tyc weathered each accusation and insult, patiently defending his stance. As we drove off towards the second monument, he told me of his determination to engage even his most hostile opponents. “We have to talk. If we don’t, we’ll start killing each other.” He hoped the men would visit Surmówka, the site of his monument park, and share their views there. (Instead, the men shared a video of that exchange with Polish state TV, which included it in a 25-minute exposé on “Russian agents of influence” broadcast 10 days later on Channel 1. A large part of the programme was devoted to Tyc’s work in Poland, and Zakharian’s deportation on charges of waging hybrid warfare on Moscow’s behalf.)Very soon, that magnificent steel sculpture will stand alongside other monuments deep in the forests of northern Poland. It is here, outside the village of Podborsko, that a compound codenamed Object 3001 lies. It is one of three nuclear bunkers built in Poland at the end of the 1960s, with the capacity to store 160 atomic warheads. Camouflaged and hidden from prying eyes, it was known to only a dozen officials in communist Poland – the population at large was convinced that the country was free of such weapons. It remained a state secret until the collapse of communism, when it was handed first to the Polish army, then to the prison service and, finally, to local authorities. It is here that IPN is gathering Poland’s monuments of gratitude for a museum aimed at exposing the mendacity of the communist system. Within this maze of yellow corridors and reinforced steel doors, an exhibition on totalitarianism will soon open its doors.Main image: a defaced monument to Russian soldiers in a park in Warsaw.

Within a second of the particle being spotted, IceCube issued an automatic alert, prompting an international race to find the neutrino’s origin.Because scientists on the IceCube experiment had worked out the path the particle took through their subterranean ice instrument, astronomers knew where in the sky to look for the particle’s source. A string of early observations came up blank, but days later Nasa’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope spotted the likely source: a flaring “blazar”.Most galaxies are thought to have spinning supermassive black holes at their centres. But some of these black holes appear to pull in material at ferocious rates, a process that simultaneously sends streams of highly energetic particles out into space. Such galaxies are called blazars, although the term only applies when one of these streams is directed straight at Earth.The blazar that appears to have sent the neutrino our way lies 3.7bn light years from Earth, just off the left shoulder of the constellation of Orion. While a single detection is not strong evidence, the IceCube scientists went back through their records and found a flurry of neutrinos coming from the same spot over 150 days in 2014 and 2015. Details are published in two separate papers in the journal Science.By discovering the neutrino’s origins, astronomers may also have solved the 100-year-old puzzle of what kinds of objects can create high-energy cosmic rays that occasionally hit the planet. Cosmic rays are made up of protons and other charged particles and are almost impossible to trace to their origins because the particles are deflected by magnetic fields as they travel through space. But high-energy cosmic rays also form neutrinos, which travel in straight lines so are easier to trace back to their source.“We know that there are these very high-energy cosmic rays being accelerated out there somewhere and it’s a century-old mystery where they are coming from,” said Erik Blaufuss, who works on IceCube at the University of Maryland. “The problem with cosmic rays is that they go out into space and get scrambled.”In tracing the neutrino back to its origin, scientists have launched a new era of astronomy, one in which the heavens can be observed not only with traditional telescopes, and even gravitational wave observatories, but with neutrino detectors too. “How much we are just starting to scratch the surface is the big question we are grappling with now,” said Blaufuss.Neutrinos are extraordinary particles. So light that they were once thought to be massless, they stream continuously out from the sun in vast quantities. Most of the time they pass through objects in their path: about 100bn pass unnoticed through the area of a fingertip every second. Collisions with other particles such as that detected in Antarctica happen very rarely.Julian Osborne at the University of Leicester was part of a team that used Nasa’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory to confirm the flaring blazar. “This is literally a new way of seeing the universe,” he said. “This really is the dawn of a new type of astronomy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/678906fe74460826e5ba341715b64cf168d789ab/0_200_4213_2528/master/4213.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5d0e3fe2260ce09613069b6e6ea77d8","title":"tour de france stage six report dan martin mur de bretagne","story":"Geraint Thomas slipped ahead of his teammate Chris Froome at the finish to stage six of the Tour de France as Ireland’s Dan Martin, one of the contenders for a top-three finish in Paris, took his first victory since 2013.Martin, sixth overall in last year’s Tour and second on the Mûr de Bretagne climb in the 2015 Tour, attacked in the final kilometre of the stage, in response to earlier moves from Julian Alaphilippe of France and Richie Porte of Australia, and held off a last-ditch pursuit from Pierre Latour, a team-mate of Romain Bardet, third overall in the 2017 Tour.“It’s a great feeling to actually get a win again as I’ve had so many second places in the Tour since the last win,” Martin said. “But today there was no question. I just attacked as hard as I could. It means this Tour is already a success and everything else will be a bonus.”Froome may only have lost five seconds on his Welsh teammate on the climb to the finish but in the group ahead of him with Thomas were his rivals Porte, Adam Yates and the past Grand Tour winners Nairo Quintana and Vincenzo Nibali. “In the final I tried to play it a bit too late,” said Thomas, who is now second, three seconds adrift of Greg Van Avermaet.Thomas, who snatched a couple of bonus seconds during the stage, said that he felt that “everyone will be watching me now”. He said: “I got away with it twice, I don’t think I could get away with it a third time. It was more just going for it because I saw the\u0026nbspopportunity.”Thomas, who appeared to momentarily hesitate and look over his shoulder as he moved ahead of Froome, may now be able to take the race leader’s yellow jersey before Monday’s rest day. Others speculated over which rider on whom Team Sky would focus. “It’ll be interesting now to see if Sky back Geraint Thomas or Froome,” Porte said. Froome is 62 seconds adrift of Van Avermaet.But there were other reasons for Froome to be cheerful after Tom Dumoulin, who he had identified on Wednesday as his principal threat, and the French contender Romain Bardet fell behind him in the overall standings after losing time in the final kilometres.The 2017 Giro d’Italia champion Dumoulin lost the best part of a minute after puncturing five kilometres from the finish. He was then docked a further 20 seconds by the race judges for drafting behind a team car as he chased back on to the rear of the peloton.While riding in the slipstream of a team car in a bid to chase back to the main field is often allowed, Dumoulin’s blatant drafting for long periods was ruled beyond the pale.Bardet, who suffered a broken wheel, was forced to swap bikes with a teammate and lost more than half a minute to Martin. He is now well over a minute and a half behind Thomas in the overall standings before the Tour reaches his favoured terrain of the Alps. “It wasn’t a good day,” Bardet’s team manager,Vincent Lavenu, said. “The time gaps are mounting. Romain made a huge effort to get back to the peloton and he paid for it in the finale.”Bardet, who is widely touted in France as Froome’s strongest rival, will have no choice but to go on the offensive when the mountain stages begin next week.The polemics around Froome’s presence continued. At the start village in Brest, the five-times Tour winner Bernard Hinault, who had called for the peloton to strike if Froome started the Tour, was unrepentant.Hinault refused to speak about Froome with the British media but told French journalists he had no regrets. “Regret what I said? Never. All I said was the truth of the matter, and that’s it,” the 63-year-old Breton said. “You have to stand up for yourself in life, they have forgotten that.”1 Dan Martin (UAE-Emirates) 4hr 13min 43sec2 Pierre Latour (AG2R La Mondiale) at 1sec3 Alejandro Valverde (Movistar) at 3sec4 Julian Alaphilippe (Quick-Step) same time5 Rafal Majka (Bora-Hansgrohe) st6 Adam Yates (Mitchelton-Scott) st7 Bauke Mollema (Trek-Segafredo) st8 Peter Sagan (Bora-Hansgrohe) st9 Geraint Thomas (Team Sky) st10 Primoz Roglic (Lotto NL-Jumbo) st1 Greg van Avermaet (BMC Racing) 22hr 35min 46sec2 Geraint Thomas (Team Sky) at 3 sec3 Tejay van Garderen (BMC) at 5 sec4 Julian Alaphilippe (Quick-Step) at 6sec5 Philippe Gilbert (Quick-Step) at 12sec6 Bob Jungels (Quick-Step) at 18sec7 Rigoberto Uran (EF-Drapac Cannondale) at 45sec8 Alejandro Valverde (Movistar) at 51sec9 Rafal Majka (Bora-Hansgrohe) at 52sec10 Jakob Fuglslang (Astana) at 53sec"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ad72697990b6e1fba24d4e23effed8e40c180df/258_261_674_405/master/674.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2bc7263b9d3b6ff4431129616e5aed6","title":"albania kala festival new younger holidaymakers beaches","story":"A new arrival on the festival circuit, Albania is tempting younger holidaymakers to dance on its beaches and explore beyond its pristine shoresJust how seriously the Albanian ministry of tourism was taking Kala festival – the first international event of its kind in the country – became clear the moment we stepped off the boat at Saranda to find a police escort waiting to accompany our coaches on the winding, mountainous transfer. That and the arrival of prime minister Edi Rama the following day, for an impromptu poolside press conference with the organisers at our hotel.“Albania has always been beautiful,” he mused, as an inflatable pink flamingo drifted across the pool behind him. “But people think of it as a place where you get robbed or killed … But the stigma has helped us. When someone visits and gets out alive, they realise it’s paradise! It’s like the forbidden apple: don’t bite it or you’ll want it all the time.”As for his thoughts on Kala? “I have to admit, I don’t know anything about the festival but, in principle, it’s fantastic,” he said, offering one night of free Albanian beer before disappearing. Dry Balkan wit and free beer aside, Albania isn’t high on the list of Europe’s most-visited countries. It sees around 80,000 UK visitors a year – a tiny number compared with the 3 million who travel annually to neighbouring Greece, or the 765,000 who visit nearby Croatia. But that could be set to change. In 2014, the New York Times included the Albanian coast among its best new destinations (“This is Europe when it was fresh and cheap,” it wrote), while Lonely Planet ranked its capital, Tirana, among the best places to visit in Europe this year.Kala – a week-long festival held in June at the upmarket resort town of Dhërmi – could cement Albania’s reputation as an exciting new beach and party destination, in the same way that Outlook and Dimensions put Croatia on the map for young Brits. At the moment, Dhërmi is a little tricky to get to: a flight to Corfu, then four hours by ferry and bus. However, with a new airport set to open in Vlora (just 50km from Dhërmi) in 2020, access is likely to improve dramatically.Kala took place last month across five sites in Dhërmi, with hotel beach bars as venues. Just 2,000 tickets were available, so there was plenty of space on the beach, crystal-clear water, as well as uncrowded, easy-going restaurants (seafood linguine at Luciano’s became a favourite). Festival tickets included accommodation packages, from beach huts to B\u0026ampBs to smart hotels, all close to the action. With a wellness programme (yoga and gong baths overlooking the Ionian sea) running alongside the music events, the festival was aimed equally at those interested in a laid-back beach break (a bit like summer-long boutique Croatian festival Obonjan), as at those wanting to party all night (there is music until 6am daily).The lineup was predominantly electronic music, using London’s underground collectives – Feelings, Secretsundaze, Phonica and Stamp the Wax – to build a crowd (many festivalgoers were from the UK), as well as the likes of Moodymann, Maurice Fulton and Tama Sumo and Lakuti. Headliners included Tom Misch and Todd Terje, while the lazy, sun-drenched soul of Roy Ayers had the crowd eating out of his hand.The team that founded Kala – Mainstage Travel – is behind one of Europe’s major winter festivals, Snowboxx. It had been trying to launch a summer event for three years. “We searched Portugal, Croatia, Italy, Spain, Malta, Morocco, but couldn’t find anything off the beaten track,” Alan Crofton, the festival director, told me. “In October last year, we visited Dhërmi for the first time and immediately saw the potential. The idea is that it’s a holiday, you come, you chill on the beach …”Most of the people I spoke to echoed this. “The best thing was going somewhere I’ve never been before,” said Rebecca, 27, from London. “I wanted to do a festival abroad. I found it on Resident Advisor and the pics just looked amazing.”With many people staying for the full week, the ministry of tourism was encouraging guests to explore other highlights of the Albanian riviera. These included Grama Bay, dubbed Albania’s answer to Alex Garland’s The Beach – a secluded bay accessible only by boat, with dazzling blue water and hundreds of rock inscriptions dating as far back as the 3rd century BC Blue Eye spring, a 45-metre-deep pool surrounded by hazelnut trees and Ksamil Beach, a coastal village from which four uninhabited islands can be explored by boat.For me, the most unforgettable element of Kala was the venue at Gjipe, a beach and eco-campground in the next bay, a six-minute speedboat ride from Dhërmi. Just beyond the beach, surrounded by lush trees and flanked by steep, red cliffs, was a small stage and sound system, where you could dance until the sun set and it was time to take the boat back.DJs including Bjørn Torske, Nick The Record and Jenifa Mayanja took turns to play to a crowd of sunkissed, beaming faces … music bouncing down the gorge, which changed colour every hour as the light faded. A walk into the canyon led to a secret waterfall – a hint of other secrets this stretch of coast might reveal.The prime minister wasn’t kidding about what a paradise this country is. Turns out he wasn’t kidding about the free beer either. With two days to go until the end of the festival, I ran into Crofton, who was grinning wildly. “I just got a text from the prime minister,” he said. “He’s sending over a pallet of beer ... I guess everyone at the festival gets a free one.”• The trip was provided by Kala festival. Dates for 2019 tbc.

America is not only about being proud but about being brave and standing for what we believe.”Moore, who was accused of sexual misconduct by nine women, also complained that Cohen was part of a string of “vicious false political attacks” and that his art is “trickery, deception, and dishonesty”.The conservative pundit and ex-congressman Joe Walsh has revealed on Twitter that he was also duped into an interview with Cohen for the show after being told that Steven Spielberg and Rupert Murdoch also took part.“Dressing up as a wounded veteran is absolutely stolen valor, his tactics are disgusting,” he tweeted. “I totally get @SachaBaronCohen’s gig. He’s a comedian, and he can be funny, but mocking a disabled veteran to spoof @SarahPalinUSA is a serious matter. I am just telling you what I encountered – it was much of the same she experienced.”In a previously released clip, Cohen had Dick Cheney sign a “waterboard kit” while a teaser suggested a variety of characters used in the upcoming series which has been in development for over a year.Who Is America? begins on Showtime in the US and Stan in Australia on Sunday, and on Channel 4 in the UK on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2edae1f3cd1dea86959608e3a11e512dba54238b/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24f992eb1494831fc1022263a36bc233","title":"friday briefing please just play your golf and leave","story":"President also endorses Boris Johnson for PM in broadside … Japan grapples with flood devastation … and Jodie Foster returns to the screenHello, I’m Warren Murray, welcome to Friday morning – and what a morning it is.The prime minister’s decision to host a UK visit by Donald Trump has backfired against her in the worst possible fashion, with the US president bucketing her plan for Brexit in extraordinary comments that trampled all protocols of relations between world leaders. “If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,” said the president in a Sun interview. “If they do that, then their trade deal with the US will probably not be made.”Trump suggested May’s Brexit white paper – which faced a barrage of criticism from Eurosceptics as it was presented in the Commons yesterday – was not what people have voted for. “I actually told Theresa May how to do it, but she didn’t agree, she didn’t listen to me,” Trump said. That forced Downing Street to rush out a statement in which May insisted her model “absolutely delivers on the Brexit people voted for. They voted for us to take back control of our money, our law and our borders and that’s exactly what we will do.” Trump undermined May further by saying Boris Johnson was “a very talented guy” who “would be a great prime minister … I was very saddened to see he was leaving government and I hope he goes back in at some point.” In response, there has been trenchant criticism of Trump’s broadside from Labour and remainer MPs, and a notable lack of vocal support for him from Brexiteers. His limited grasp of the matters he held forth on was exemplified when he appeared to hold Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, personally responsible for immigration in the UK and Europe. “I think allowing millions and millions of people to come into Europe is very, very sad … You have a mayor who has done a terrible job in London.” Khan has nothing to do with immigration.Protests against the presidential visit continue: the use of a “major PA system” is to be allowed during a London march today but the “baby blimp” has been banned from the skies above Trump’s Turnberry golf course in Scotland. Let us know how you are marking this auspicious occasion. Presidents Club censured – Trustees of the charity behind a gala dinner failed female workers who were made to wear “sexy” clothes and then groped and propositioned for sex by attendees, the Charity Commission has found. In contrast the Presidents Club took “careful steps” to protect the identity of male guests. The report comes six months after details emerged of alleged “stomach-churning” behaviour by guests at the London dinner attended by senior business figures and politicians. In reply, the trustees pointed out that no one had come forward to complain in response to the commission’s call for evidence. The Presidents Club, which donated to good causes including Great Ormond Street hospital, announced after the scandal that it would close down.‘Felt like a criminal’ – The MP who unseated Nick Clegg at the 2017 election has quit the Labour party after being suspended over vulgar social media messages from his past. Jared O’Mara ended up being reinstated to the party but said he had been devastated at the treatment he received for “mistakes as a young man”. O’Mara, who has cerebral palsy, said he could not continue “under the pretence that I feel there is a place of acceptance and empathy for me as a working-class, underprivileged disabled man within the Labour party. I have experienced little to make me feel welcome, understood and accepted during this last year.” He will sit as an independent until the next election.‘I saw my house sink’ – Devastating floods and landslides across west and central Japan have left 10,000 people in shelters, another 250,000 in homes without water and the government facing the huge task of rebuilding. The death toll has risen to more 200, with scores more unaccounted for.As the prime minister, Shinzō Abe, visited devastated areas, questioned were being asked about Japan’s ability to withstand extreme weather events. Its towns and cities have been built to survive strong earthquakes but the floods have exposed serious flaws when it comes to heavy and prolonged rainfall. “I saw my house sink underwater and there was nothing I could do. I felt helpless,” said Fumiko Inokuchi, in the town of Kurashiki. “I got married here, and we built this house two years later. We raised our three sons here ... there are so many memories.”As the dust begins to settle on England semi-final defeat to Croatia, reflection on the progress made under Gareth Southgate has begun. The manager has been credited with masterminding a revival but greater challenges await following their campaign in Russia. “People may have had a feeling that playing for England was always misery and regret and recrimination,” Southgate said. “Now, I think, they have seen it can be enjoyable.”There is still the matter of a third-place playoff against Belgium though. Saturday’s game is unpopular with the players, but captain Harry Kane, who has declared himself fit, says England will try to play with pride and finish on a high.“Being in your 50s is a transitional period for actors – you’re not old enough to play the old characters and not young enough to play the young ones, so I felt like, OK, this is my time to direct.” But at 55, after a stint behind the lens, Jodie Foster is back in the acting game with the futuristic Hotel Artemis.The double Oscar winner, who famously came out on stage at the Golden Globes, tells Hadley Freeman: “I think you’re just born with a certain personality and some people might want to be astronauts and no matter how good they are at flying they can’t handle the zero gravity. I feel like I was blessed with a strength of character that keeps me intact. Although there are definitely parts of me that are crazy.” At the moment, Foster has no forthcoming projects. “I like to wait,” she says. “And you know, I’m super-excited to be acting in my 60s and 70s. I think the roles will be so much more interesting!”Five months after she finished her maternity leave and four tournaments into her comeback, Serena Williams is in the Wimbledon final again, having seen off the challenge of Julia Görges. In Saturday’s final the American world No 181 will face Angelique Kerber, who was at her resilient best as she repelled the power of Jelena Ostapenko. Headlining today’s play in SW19 is the 52nd meeting between Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic in the second men’s semi-final, following a battle of the big servers between John Isner and Kevin Anderson.Geraint Thomas slipped ahead of his teammate Chris Froome at the finish to stage six of the Tour de France as Ireland’s Dan Martin, one of the contenders for a top-three finish in Paris, took his first victory since 2013. Maurizio Sarri is set to be confirmed as Chelsea’s new head coach after Antonio Conte was finally relieved of his duties after two increasingly fractious years in charge. Kuldeep Yadav’s six-wicket sorcery set up a thumping win for India in the opening one-day international against England at Trent Bridge. And Phil Mickelson has conceded he does a lot of “dumb stuff”, after speaking at length for the first time about his controversial penalty during the US Open.China’s June trade grew by double digits, possibly boosted by US and Chinese traders who rushed to fill orders for soybeans, ball bearings and other goods in both directions before tariff hikes took effect. Asian shares have mostly been higher. The pound has traded at $1.317 and €1.129 overnight.Today’s Sun front page bears no surprises as the Trump interview was theirs: “May has wrecked Brexit … US deal is off!” The rest of us love the story too: the ’s version is “Soft Brexit will ‘kill’ UK hopes of US trade pact”. Very similar line taken in the  – “May’s soft Brexit will kill chance of US trade deal” – and the Times: “May’s Brexit will kill US trade deal, says Trump”. The FT sticks with the Brussels backlash: “Nato allies bridle at Trump claim of pledge to lift defence spending”.The Mail’s third edition calls it “President’s Brexit attack on May” and goes on that “he suggests Boris would make a great PM”. The Express splash is the “Tory revolt over May’s Brexit plan” but it puts the bad American house guest across the top: “Trump drops a bombshell on May by saying: ‘I want Boris as PM’”. “Donald Thump” is what the Mirror calls him, also referring to it as a “bombshell”.The i’s effort: “Trump flies into diplomatic storm”.

His victory, the first time an Indonesian has won any medals at the championships, prompted elation across the country.Congratulatory messages flooded in, with Zohri’s humble roots attracting attention. He is from a small village on the eastern island of Lombok, where he lives in a small house made of wood and woven bamboo. Even affording shoes has been difficult, with his older sister saying Zohri asked her for Rp400,000 (£21) to buy running trainers. Fazilah said her brother, the youngest of four, often trained barefoot. The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, said Zohri had made the country proud and ordered two cabinet ministers to arrange for his home to be renovated. Both Zohri’s parents are dead but emotional scenes broadcast from his village showed relatives and neighbours crowded around a tablet to watch the race. Amid loud cheers, one viewer bursts into tears, burying her face in her headscarf. In a video posted on Twitter, Zohri thanked the president and his fellow Indonesians for their support and prayers.Earlier this year, Zohri won gold in the 100m at the Asian junior athletics championships in Japan with a time of 10.27sec.He is now preparing for the Asian Games, scheduled to open in Jakarta on 18 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddeb04e2f2fcf4666287365ff9909b40bd8b31c1/64_217_3412_2047/master/3412.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b50fb0a82c5ef67d6a4dae696be23bb","title":"wakaliwood inside ugandas action movie studio","story":"When the trailer for Who Killed Captain Alex? went viral on YouTube, film-maker Isaac Nabwana’s mobile phone starting ringing with calls from around the world. One inidual went further. After seeing 40 seconds of the promo for Uganda’s first action movie, American Alan Hofmanis gave up his life in Manhattan to move to Wakaliga, Kampala, to help Nabwana, aka IGG, develop Ramon film studio – and Wakaliwood was born.The Ramon Film Studio, has produced more than 40 movies. Who Killed Captain Alex was produced in 2010 for just $200, while 2016’s Operation Kakongoliro! The Ugandan Expendables cost $2,000, the studio’s biggest production budget to date. To attract more viewers and break new ground, Nabwana wanted a female lead for Who Killed Captain Alex?Dozens of people work on Nabwana’s films, taking on all roles both in front and behind the camera: acting, doing stunts, designing props and costumes, technician duties and stage management. From the machinery to accessories and costumes, everything is homemade. Many of the actors live in the rehearsal rooms where costumes are kept.With little hope of pay for the moment, Wakaliwood members have side jobs. In a country where film piracy is common, Wakaliwood movies are mainly sold door-to-door and as quickly as possible, before pirated copies make it on to the market.That a film studio is able to flourish in a place where cinema has little history may surprise some. Yet, Wakaliwood has emerged despite what from the outside may appear to insurmountable obstacles.Wakaliwood is also lending credence to a Ugandan pop culture that some observers have linked to Quentin Tarantino for convenience. But it can only be understood by going beyond the violence that flows through the stories, the litres of food colouring that stains the fallen, and the archaic and mischievous special effects.For the bloody special effects, condoms are filled with food colouring and tied with a plastic ribbon around the chest of a stuntman. A metal ring is glued to the condom and fishing wire is attached to it, to be pulled by an assistant at the appropriate time. Cow blood was used in the past but some of crew members became ill after accidentally swallowed it.In a Wakaliwood movie, there are always tens of gangsters, hoodlums or bad guys whose main job is to be killed by the good guys. To attain the high body count, the bad guys wear balaclavas, or caps, or beards. This allows crew members to play numerous baddies destined for a bloody end.The film-maker’s half-brother Robert Kizito discovered kung fu 30 years ago through Bruce Lee’s films. Mimicking them to his brother, Kizito was bitten by the martial arts bug while inspiring Nabwana towards a love for the films. He scoured central market of Kampala for Chinese martial arts magazines to dissect the positions from the diagrams inside their pages. A kung fu master, Kizito and his followers where filmed by his brother for Wakaliwood’s first ever action scenes.Nabwana was child during the bloody rule of Idi Amin. The film-maker recalls the swollen corpses in a dumping ground near his home and the soldiers drumming at the doors of the houses, shouting: “Fungua mlango, panda gari” (“Open the door, get in the truck” in Swahili) Mixing memory and his love Bruce Lee films, Nabwana has emerged as unique film-maker.Eaten Alive is a movie inspired by a cannibalism case that happened a few years ago in western Uganda.Wakaliwood has captured the imagination of a nation, from the drivers of boda boda, (motorbike or bicycle taxi) to President Yoweri Museveni who did not hesitate to incorporate support for the industry as a campaign promise, during the 2016 presidential election.A VJ adds extra colour to a movie with their jokes, gamut of expressions,tone, rhythm, the turn of phrase and extra dialogue. Emmie is part of the Wakaliwood family. He comments on every movie and his commentary is part of the movie. Nabwana said he cannot shoot a movie without considering Emmie’s commentary. Audiences pay 500 Ugandan shillings (20p) a ticket for a US blockbuster and 1,000 shillings (42p) for a Wakaliga movie.I have been going to Wakaliwood for years, but I have not managed to unravel the mystery of Nabwana’s trajectory. It is the defiance of the impossible, like the life-size Bell Huey helicopter by the props crew in the yard of his family compound. Visitors describe him as a pop-culture prophet preaching from his slum the good word of cinema, communicating a certain idea of his country rather than basking the sun of international film festivals.All photography by Frédéric Noy."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3563202.1531424027!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"night time water restrictions to be introduced in dublin area","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish Water is to introduce the restrictions in the greater Dublin area from midnight to 5 am on Monday, July 16th.Night time water restrictions in the greater Dublin area will be introduced as early as next week to protect future supply and avoid widespread outages in the autumn. Irish Water and the local authorities are working through more than 800 district meter areas to establish where water supplies can be restricted and for how long while minimising the impact to homes and businesses.“At this point, Irish Water is to introduce the restrictions in the greater Dublin area from midnight to 5am on Monday, July 16th but the final decision will be made tomorrow,” an Irish Water spokeswoman said. There are more than 20 schemes across the country already on restrictions. Irish Water corporate affairs manager Kate Gannon said introducing restrictions was an option that Irish Water hoped could be avoided because of the inevitable impact on homes and businesses. She said positive conservation measures were being taken by the public in Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Meath.The development came as Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy told the Dáil that water levels were at an all-time low in some parts of the country.He said that of 1,000 water supply systems controlled by Irish Water, nine schemes are currently experiencing severe drought, 51 are in drought condition and a further 77 are in potential drought situations.Mr Murphy said reports “indicate that a significant number of recent wild land fires were caused by careless discarding of matches and cigarette ends”. He said that as the drought continues, flammable conditions for fire will remain. “This underlines the need for care to prevent wild land fires from starting.”Mr Murphy was speaking during a debate on the urgent need for water conservation due to the current prolonged period without rain. The Minister said that providing water for the longer term was the overriding concern and Irish Water was considering restricting supplies as it had to plan for September and October.He also called on TDs not to blame Irish Water for the country’s legacy problems as things get worse, adding that “they will get worse”.“It is managing the situation better than anyone else could to date,” he said. “We now have information, technology and oversight that we would never had if 31 or 34 local authorities were trying to manage that between themselves.”He added that “Irish Water did not break the pipes or under-invest over the decades. It inherited the system and it is fixing it.”Sinn Féin housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin said the State is the single biggest waster of water. “Some 36 per cent of water in the greater Dublin water supply area is lost in the distribution system.” "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Wicklow firefighters say fire at Bray Head has caused damage to railway infrastructureCity sees sixth successive night of trouble following Twelfth of July celebrationsGarda\u0026iacute are looking for a man in his late teens or early twenties who left scene after assaultDepartment of Justice advises that use of anti-loitering devices may constitute \u0026lsquoassault\u0026rsquoIreland\u0026rsquos Ambassador to Israel told of its annoyance over \u0026lsquoboycott initiative\u0026rsquoJason was in debt to a drug dealer and it was causing trouble for the family, father told garda\u0026iacuteData protection officer \u0026lsquoon leave\u0026rsquo when alterations made, says Social ProtectionGarda search uncovers variety of chemicals suspected of increasing mushroom potencyFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader rules out confidence and supply renewal talks until after October budgetResidential Tenancies Board had 170,000 calls in 2017, up 31 per centD\u0026aacuteil passes Bill aiming to deal with outstanding claims from Setanta Insurance collapseKilmainham Gaol exhibition marking centenary of statesman\u0026rsquos birth runs till JanuaryPublic consultation on Ireland\u0026rsquos new development policy calls for public submissionsT\u0026aacutenaiste warns absence of Executive and defence of status quo \u0026lsquonot a safe strategy\u0026rsquoMember tells High Court organisation breached its constitution regarding ballotsLegislation championed by Shane Ross has not concluded committee stage in the SeanadTechnology breakthrough comes as politicians call for further grants and reduced tax"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3563193.1531426036!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ryanair pilots announce two more one day strikes in july","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRyanair pilots, who are members of the Irish Airline Pilots’ Association, on picket duty at Dublin Airport on Thursday.  Photograph: Conor HealyRyanair faces further strikes by Irish pilots following Thursday’s one-day stoppage across the State’s airports that led to 30 flight cancellations.About 100 members of the Irish Airline Pilots’ Association (Ialpa) - part of trade union Forsa - took part in the industrial action, which was the first ever strike by the airline’s Irish pilots. The pilots say they want a transparent system for dealing with issues tied to seniority and length of service with the company.Dressed in their uniforms a group of the pilots gathered near the entrance to Dublin Airport from 1am. They stood behind a large banner erected on the roadside and were met with a steady stream of beeping horns and thumbs-up as members of the public showed support for the strike. People Before Profit TD Bríd Smith, who came to support the strikers, said she would make the case for greater protection for airline workers in the Dáil. “I’m humbled to be among them today, it’s an historic occasion”.On Thursday night Ialpa said it had notified Ryanair that it intends to hold two further one-day strikes on July 20th and July 24th, both beginning at 1am.Ialpa said it and the company had found some common ground in talks on Wednesday on a proposal that a joint working group could help them agree a system for dealing with the pilots’ grievances. However, the sides clashed over the group’s terms of reference.“On a number of occasions in recent months, there have been suggestions that third-party facilitation could assist in reaching consensus on issues of disagreement,” Ialpa added. “It is, therefore, regrettable that Ryanair management has so far rejected the suggestion of third-party assistance.”Ryanair said it had encouraged pilots to take up its offer of a working group to deal with the issues but “if they wish to hold another unsuccessful strike again, then so be it”.The company added that it would contact customers in due course when it received details of the strikes from the union.Ryanair on Thursday had to cancel 30 of its 290 flights from the State’s airports, affecting about 5,000 travellers. The airline said that 262 of its flights to and from the Republic operated normally and that it had re-accommodated or refunded the customers hit by cancellations.The company added that the strike by 25 per cent of its pilots had “achieved nothing”.Around 100 of 350 Irish-based directly-employed Ryanair pilots are members of the union. It is understood that legal difficulties prevent Ialpa recruiting those on contracts.In a memo to pilots, Ryanair argued that the issues boiled down to annual leave, command upgrades and base transfers.“On all these issue Ryanair had a written proposal, provided in advance, to which we got no response yesterday,” it said.It argued the pilots’ proposals were not suitable for an airline with 87 bases and is increasing its fleet by 50 per cent a year."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"digitalservices@telegraphHead of Digital Publishingdigitalservices@telegraphMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

And at the end, he takes the gag out of my mouth and he said, \u0027Sorry for the prophylactic.\u0027 So he had gagged me with a condom.The actress, speaking on a Hollywood Foreign Press Association podcast, added: I was too young, thank God, to know what a condom tasted like. It was so inappropriate.

The audition incident when she was a teenager did not involve Weinstein.In October she told the New Yorker magazine that Weinstein had chased her around a room after he started massaging her shoulders at a hotel in Torontoin 1995.Sir Peter Jackson, the Lord Of The Rings director, revealed recently that Weintein had waged a smear campaign against Sorvino after she rejected his advances.Weinstein told Sir Peter that Sorvino was a nightmare to work with, leading to her name being taken off his casting list.Weinstein, 66, has been charged with sexual offences including rape.

And just as with the earlier discovery, the new development\u0026nbsprelied on scientists spotting the tiniest disturbance down on Earth, and tracking it to a mysterious black hole billions of light years away.The neutrino is the first of its kind detected and its likely origin was traced\u0026nbspto a “blazar” four billion light years away. There, it was thrown out by a galaxy with a vast black hole at its centre, flung across the universe as the cosmic consumes matter.Scientists have been mystified by cosmic rays since they were found more than a century ago, pouring down onto Earth. Despite their huge number and intense power, it has been unclear where they\u0026nbspcome from.The new discovery could finally explain where cosmic rays originate. If correct, the answer would be\u0026nbspa fittingly spectacular phenomenon deep in the universe.The neutrinos appear to be spewing out of fast spinning supermassive black holes and the discovery could give us an entirely new way of looking at the universe.The particles might be a “third messenger” carrying\u0026nbspenergy from elsewhere in the cosmos, in addition to light and gravitational waves.If so, the newly observed\u0026nbspparticle would be an unprecedented new way\u0026nbspof understanding some of the most intense and mysterious phenomena in the universe. Neutrinos could be doubly helpful because they have no mass and travel in an almost entirely straight line through the universe – which makes them very difficult to detect but very easy to track, as they travel billions of light years.“Neutrinos rarely interact with matter,” said\u0026nbspProfessor Paul O’Brien, a member of the international team of astronomers at the University of Leicester. “To detect them at all from the cosmos is amazing, but to have a possible source identified is a triumph.“This result will allow us to study the most distant, powerful energy sources in the universe in a completely new way.”The discovery was reported in two new papers published in the journal Science, and was the result of work by a huge\u0026nbspglobal team of researchers.The neutrino was found on September 22 by the IceCube observatory, a huge facility a mile beneath the South Pole.A grid of more than 5,000 super sensitive sensors picked up the characteristic blue “Cherenkov” light emitted as the neutrino interacted with\u0026nbspice.Having almost no mass and passing right through planets, stars and anything else in its way, the particle travelled in a straight line from its point of origin to Earth.As a result, astronomers were able to track its trajectory back across billions of light years to its probable source.News of the detection sent astronomers into a frenzy as telescopes were pointed in the suggested direction. The search led to a “blazar”, a special class of galaxy containing a supermassive black hole four billion light years away, just to the left of the constellation Orion.The finding was the result of a global effort to track down the source, triggered by an automated alert after the intriguing detection at the South Pole.“This result really highlights the importance of taking a multimessenger approach to these searches,” said Erik Blaufuss, a research scientist in the UMD Department of Physics who led the effort – over several years – to create and deploy IceCube’s high energy event alert system. “Any one observation made alone would likely not have let us piece together what is actually going on inside this source.”A key feature of blazars is twin jets of light and elementary particles that shoot from the poles of the swirling whirlwind of material surrounding the black hole. One of those jets happened to point towards Earth and led to one of the most profound discoveries in the history of astrophysics.The neutrino detected by IceCube is thought to have been created by high energy cosmic rays from the jets interacting with nearby material.Unlike high energy neutrinos, most cosmic rays carry an electric charge that causes their trajectories to be warped by magnetic fields, making it impossible to trace their origins. By contrast, neutrinos are unaffected by even the most powerful magnetic fields.The blazar believed to have generated the neutrino – codenamed TXS 0506 + 056 – was located in less than a minute, after the IceCube team relayed coordinates for follow-up observations to telescopes worldwide.Being able to detect high energy neutrinos will provide yet another window on the universe, say\u0026nbspthe scientists.The sensational discovery of the second “messenger”, gravitational waves – ripples in space-time – was announced in February 2016.France Cordova, director of the US National Science Foundation (NSF), that manages the IceCube laboratory, said: “The era of multimessenger astrophysics is here.Cosmic rays were discovered in 1912 by physicist Victor Hess, using instruments on a balloon flight.Later research showed them to be made\u0026nbspof protons, electrons or atomic nuclei accelerated to speeds approaching that of light.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point. Beauty influencer Emily Weiss now has a cosmetic company, Glossier, and within the last couple of weeks M\u0026ampC Saatchi bought a stake in two influencer agencies.

C. to receive an award for my strong support of Israel in commemoration of her 70th anniversary as a nation. Because Alabama has always been at the forefront of support of Israel and because I share a strong belief in God as the Creator and Sustainer of all life, as does Israel, I eventually accepted the invitation. Expenses were paid, and I received no private remuneration for my time or participation. I did not know Sacha Cohen or that a Showtime TV series was being planned to embarrass, humiliate, and mock not only Israel, but also religious conservatives such as Sarah Palin, Joe Walsh, and Dick Cheney.I do not apologize for my belief in God or the common religious and cultural heritage that Israel shares with America.As an Alabamian, I believe in truth and honesty, which the shadowy media groups behind this illicit scheme do not. Obviously, people like Cohen who mock not only Israel but those who support Israel and the principles upon which America is based, do not share my beliefs.I don’t need Sacha Cohen to tell me who America is, but I can tell him that America is a proud Nation which sprang from humble beginnings and a strong belief in God, virtue, and morality.As an American, I would never hide my identity and deceive others only to mock and ridicule them as this Showtime Series is designed to do. America is not only about being proud but about being brave and standing for what we believe.I am involved in several court cases presently to defend my honor and character against vicious false political attacks by liberals like Cohen. If Showtime airs a defamatory attack on my character, I may very well be involved in another. As for Mr. Cohen, whose art is trickery, deception, and dishonesty, Alabama does not respect cowards who exhibit such traits! It’s been a long time since I fought for my country in Vietnam.

Of these, 1,014 were born in Jamaica, 207 in Barbados, 93 in India, 88 in Grenada, 85 in Trinidad and Tobago and 638 were from other countries.Some 584 people have so far been granted citizenship through the Windrush scheme.The department is only in touch with 14 people who were wrongly deported, and no details have been given about their nationalities or whether any of them had been allowed to return to the UK. Contact has not been made with the majority of those wrongly deported or removed, the Home Office has said.\u0026nbspLabour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said she was disappointed there was still no clarity about the number of people wrongly detained, and that the Home Office had “still not managed to make contact with the majority of those who were wrongfully deported or removed”.“The committee is awaiting more information from the Home Office, which is expected by the end of this week, and will be asking further questions to follow up the information in the Home Secretary’s letter,” she said.Mr Javid said officials were also reviewing cases where the Home Office has ordered other departments to deny or revoke services, or taken action to penalise a third party for employing or housing an unlawful migrant.A final figure of those affected will not be available until the review is complete, he said.\u0026nbspThe news comes after a damning report by the Home Affairs Select Committee said unless the Home Office was overhauled, the scandal “will happen again, for another group of people”.The committee expressed concern for the children of EU citizens, saying the government should ensure they are not “locked out of living a lawful life, as we have seen happen to members of the Windrush generation”.The MPs also said recent attempts by the government to rebrand its “hostile environment” policy the “compliant environment”, were “meaningless”.A Home Office spokesperson said: “It is not acceptable that people of the Windrush generation have been negatively impacted by these measures. That is why we have put in place additional safeguards and put a temporary pause in the proactive sharing of Home Office data with other organisations, including banks and building societies, for the purpose of controlling access to services.\u0026nbsp“Data on people over 30 have been excluded from sharing to make absolutely sure that members of the Windrush generation are not inadvertently affected.

UK officials in Brussels say they have now have no plans to bring forward new proposals on the border, having proposed a solution to it last month.\u0026nbspThe EU raised serious concerns about that temporary customs plan at the time, including its time-limited nature and the lack of regulatory alignment, which would lead to border checks.But on Thursday British diplomats said they believed the new white paper on the future relationship would change the “dynamic” of talks and see Brussels look at their previous proposal in a new light.Brussels officials close to talks expressed doubt that this would be the case.The European Commission is understood to be working on revising its own Northern Ireland backstop plan, which Britain has rejected. Theresa May has said that “no UK prime minister” could agree to it because it entails customs checks inside the UK, between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.As Ms May’s cabinet met at Chequers last Friday, European Commission chief negotiator Michel Barnier urged the UK government to think again\u0026nbspand suggested the issue should be “de-dramatised”. But senior cabinet sources have said that even those in favour of a softer Brexit in the PM’s inner circle would reject the plan. The DUP, on which Ms May relies for a majority in the House of Commons, has also said it would not accept the policy.The European parliament’s Brexit steering group said it welcomed the new white paper as “a step towards establishing a new relationship between the UK and the EU”.But it added: “The Brexit steering group reiterated that negotiating a new relationship with the UK post-Brexit is conditional on an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU on the basis of a withdrawal agreement.\u0026nbsp“It reconfirmed the parliament’s position expressed in its resolutions that it will not consent to a withdrawal agreement, including a transition period, without a credible ‘back-stop’ provision for the Northern IrelandIreland border to prevent a hard border and safeguard the integrity of the single market, faithfully reflecting the commitments entered into in the joint report of 8 December 2017.\u0026nbspBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspMr Afwerki then travelled across the capital in a large motorcade as people wearing T-shirts with photos of the two leaders cheered. The leaders later met one-on-one, with a smiling Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspleaning towards\u0026nbspMr Afwerki under a wall hung with their portraits.The visit comes a month after Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspsurprised people by fully accepting a peace deal that ended a two-year border war between the two countries. Ethiopia and Eritrea have not had diplomatic ties since the war began in 1998, with Mr Ahmed\u0026nbsphimself fighting in a town that remains contested today, and the countries have skirmished since then in one of Africa’s longest-running conflicts.Mr Ahmed’s chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, said on Twitter that the visit aims to “further deepen efforts to bring about lasting peace.” He shared photos of the leaders’ meeting and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas “very warmly received” by Mr Afwerki.“Our two nations share a history and bond like no other,” he said. “We can now overcome two decades of mistrust and move in a new direction.”Ethiopia’s foreign ministry called the visit “part of efforts to normalise relations with Eritrea” and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas expected to talk with Eritrea’s leadership about “how to mend fences”.One Eritrean diplomat, its ambassador to Japan Estifanos Afeworki, said on Twitter that “no leader has received such a warm welcome like today in Asmara in the history of Eritrea”.Ethiopians expressed welcome shock at the meeting, which was shown live by Ethiopia’s state TV.“Historic ... the beginning of the end. The glass ceiling has been broken,” one resident, Shewit Wudassie, wrote on Facebook. Another Facebook user, Djphat Su, wrote: “Am I dreaming or what?”The decision to fully accept the peace deal was the biggest and most surprising reform yet announced by Ethiopia’s 42-year-old prime minister, who took office in April and quickly set off a wave of reforms, freeing journalists and opposition figures from prison, opening up the state-run economy and unblocking hundreds of websites after years of anti-government protests demanding more freedoms.World news in picturesUS President Donald Trump and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg attend a bilateral breakfast ahead of the NATO Summit in BrusselsThe last four Thai Navy SEALs come out safely after completing the rescue mission inside a cave where 12 boys and their soccer coach have been trapped since June 23, in Mae Sai, Chiang Rai province, northern Thailand.

Frontex runs an operation off the coast of Italy that works closely with the local coast guard.The EU missions have helped rescue thousands of refugees\u0026nbspat sea, all of whom were disembarked in Italy. Spokespeople at Frontex and Sophia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Italy has so far refused to take back any migrants stopped at the German border.“Before receiving even one asylum seeker from another European country, we want to see a precise commitment – giving the timetable, costs, means, men and resources –\u0026nbspon how the EU plans to help us defend our external borders,” Mr Salvini said last week.Aid groups and United Nations’ agencies on Friday asked Italy open its ports to rescue ships because the policy could have a high human cost. More migrants could die at sea, or they could be trapped indefinitely in inhumane detention centres, they said.On Sunday, Mr Salvini said the previous government had agreed to welcome migrants rescued by ships participating in the EU sea missions.Mr Salvini said: “With our government, the music has changed and will change”.This comes after a rescue boat carrying 60 refugees arrived in Barcelona last week after being turned away by Italy and Malta.The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, came to the ship’s rescue when she, with permission from the Spanish government, told the crew of the vessel that it could dock.\u0026nbspThe boat, which was said to have had five women, a nine-year-old and four teenagers on board, was turned away by Mr Salvini.He said the rescue boat “can forget about arriving in an Italian port” and then suggested the boat should dock in Malta which he claimed was the nearest port.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

All French parties are entitled to money in proportion to the number of votes it receives.The party, which recently changed its name from National Front to National Rally in an attempt to distance itself from racist and antisemitic associations, has long suffered from financial problems.In 2014 it took a loan from a Russian bank, saying it had been refused credit in France.

But in practice, how does that work given that most sexual encounters are one-on-one with no witnesses?She can still say yes at the time then later pretend she didn’t and falsely accuse him of rape.And equally, he could pretend she had consented when, in fact, she had screamed no.Perhaps we are moving to an era when all young people will feel compelled to temporarily stall a moment of passion so they can film the consenting “yes” on their mobile phones? Or failing that, perhaps have a solicitor present.ACTRESS Paula Williamson wed “Britain’s most violent prisoner” Charles Bronson last November and said she looked forward to him getting out so they could enjoy a normal marriage.Yet just two months later he allegedly attacked the deputy governor of HMP Wakefield and now, just before appearing via video link at Leeds magistrates court, he tried to take his guards hostage in his cell.Hmmmm. Something tells me that – after spending 42 years inside – 65-year-old Charlie boy has become institutionalised and doesn’t actually want to come out, hence the litany of violent episodes that keep him in trouble and constantly embarrass his trusting wife.It gives a whole new meaning to the term blushing bride.NEW research shows that the ability to ward off fear and unhappiness is a skill that improves markedly with age.An American neuroscientist says the reaction of the old and the young to, say, the imminent results of an election were significantly different.That’s because, when you’ve seen a few governments come and go, we of a certain age eventually realise they’re all as useless as each other and whatever we say or do to try to change that has no effect at all.But if it turns out to be a France v England final, I may be heading home sooner than expected.FORMER Radio 1 DJ “Diddy” David Hamilton has weighed in to the #MeToo debate with his recollection of his Seventies heyday, saying: “We didn’t go around forcing ourselves on women.“It sounds conceited to say it but we didn’t have to because a lot of women were forcing themselves on us.”Meanwhile, Kinks frontman Sir Ray Davies reveals: “A world-famous groupie once threw me out because I was too kind.”A reminder, if needed, that not all men are b******s and not all women are innocent victims.And if further proof is required, look no further than some of the predatory females stalking their male prey on Love Island each night.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will we be able to sign our own trade deals? And will the UK be outside the jurisdiction of the European Court?I’m very pleased to say the answers are very simple: yes, yes and yes.First, it will mean a genuine end to freedom of movement.No longer will people be allowed to arrive here from across Europe on the off-chance that they might find a job.We will always welcome the skilled professionals who help our country thrive, from doctors and nurses to engineers and entrepreneurs but for the first time in decades, we will have full control of our borders.And it will be the UK, not Brussels, that decides who should be allowed to live and work here.Second, we will have our own completely independent trade policy, our own seat at the World Trade Organisation and the ability to set tariffs and strike trade deals with whoever we please.British goods and services are in huge demand internationally, so it’s no surprise that countries are queuing up to make trade deals with us after we leave the EU.We are having good discussions with countries we would aim to sign trade deals with, including the US, as I will discuss with President Trump when he arrives in the UK on Thursday.Third, our plan will take back control of our laws.We will no longer be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union, instead, British judges in British courts will rule on our laws.And while we will commit to have common rules with the EU on things like exhaust emissions and food safety, Parliament will have to agree these rules.Put simply, such EU rules will no longer automatically and directly apply in the UK — Parliament will have a say.It’s clear to me that this is the right Brexit deal for Britain, although there are, of course, some alternatives.The EU’s preferred option — a standard, off-the-shelf trade deal for Great Britain with Northern Ireland in the customs union and parts of the single market — would break up our country.The other option the EU suggests, a combination of EEA membership with continued membership of the customs union, would not be Brexit at all.We would have no control over immigration, no ability to strike our own trade deals, and would still be liable for vast annual payments to Brussels.And while we must prepare for the possibility of leaving without a deal, I’m clear that the best outcome — for both the UK and the EU — is a deal based on the ideas we are setting out on Thursday.As for Labour, they are opening the door to a second referendum — ignoring the decision taken by the country and making it harder to get a good deal.Only our Brexit deal for Britain truly respects the will of the British people.And, as Prime Minister, it is the Brexit I am determined to deliver.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sometimes that’s the only way to sort stuff out.That’s what the US President Donald Trump is doing right now with his Nato allies. And it’s a mighty big sledgehammer.In the firing line is Angela Merkel, of Germany. And the other countries that are backsliding on their commitment to the civilised world’s safety and security.Trump thinks — and he’s right — that for far too long Europe and Canada have not been paying their share for our military defence. The Germans pay nowhere near enough. But even worse are the Belgians.Incredibly, Canada, led by that simpering idiot Justin Trudeau, spends scarcely more than one per cent of its GDP on defence. One of the richest countries on the world. The Spanish, as you might expect, pay four fifths of sod all. LESS than one per cent.Trump is telling them all they cannot depend on America any more. The US spends 3.5 per cent of its enormous GDP on the military. Much more than any other country in Nato.And as a consequence, Western Europe (and Canada) has been safe for decades. It was US military spending which led to the end of the Cold War and ultimately the break up of the “evil empire”, the Soviet Union.So where do we stand in all this? We spend more per head than our European partners, Estonia and Greece excepted. But still just the bare minimum of two per cent of GDP.And for years now we’ve been reducing our defence budgets. Cutting our armed services to the bone. Take the Royal Navy. In the 36 years since the Falklands War the number of warships we possess has reduced by a staggering 74 per cent.We now have a Navy which is 25 per cent smaller than it was in 1650 — when we had only a tenth of our current population. We were once a great maritime power. Today we’d do well to win a naval battle against Luxembourg — and that’s landlocked.Military spending does not create wars. It does the opposite. It makes them much, much less likely.The Falklands War against Argentina occurred because we had cut our spending on the Navy to the point where we no longer defended the far-flung islands. The Argies saw their chance and invaded.Luckily we still had a big enough Navy to respond and win back the freedom for the Falklanders. We couldn’t even dream of doing the same thing now.Meanwhile, the RAF has seen its number of combat aircraft cut by more than one third in less than ten years. We now have just 149. You probably saw them during the flypast on Tuesday, if you live in London. That was the lot. That’s it.The first duty of any government is to protect its citizens. The US does that and we should do so, too — never mind the backsliding Europeans.The world is no less of a dangerous place than it was 30 or 60 years ago. Trump has got this absolutely right.NAZ SHAH is a Labour MP. Not so long ago she was suspended from the party.She had agreed with the foul and offensive idea that Israel should be “relocated” to the USA.Shah also compared the Israeli government to Adolf Hitler. Now she’s back in the party – and guess what? She’s been given a front bench role. As shadow equalities minister!They certainly take anti-Semitism seriously in Corbyn’s Labour Party. Surely there cannot be any Jewish people left in the country who would vote for this racist rabble.I’VE seen many remarkable things in my life. I’ve watched my team, Millwall, play in an FA Cup Final.I’ve seen the sun set at lunchtime in the Arctic Circle. I’ve talked to Arab terrorists, American presidents and famous pop singers. But there’s one thing I’ve never done.I have never, ever, in my entire life, met anyone who liked Danny Dyer. I was at party last week with people from all walks of life, and Danny’s name came up.The reaction was immediate. “Oh Christ, not that d**k . . .I think one woman even went behind a bush to be sick. Anyway, just thought I’d mention that.Maybe one day I will meet someone who likes Danny Dyer. And my life will be complete.IMPORTANT news story. Emily Ratajkowski is on holiday.We know this because she has very kindly sent the world some photographs of her break.But I will make sure to send back to The Sun some snaps of me lying on a sunbed with my a*se in the air, or posing in something alluring by a pool with a big pout on my chops. Enjoy.The EUS chief negotiator, Michel barnier wit Jeane-Claude Juncker - and the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel.And that, frankly, is all you need to knowBEST news of the week, maybe of the year, was the heroic rescue of those young Thai kids from a flooded cave complex.It was an enormous, dangerous and brilliantly executed plan to get them out.And now, guess what? Hollywood is going to make a film about it all.YOU know the score, I don’t.All of my Wednesday is spent in a state of mental torture.What if we don’t crock Modric early on? When’s Harry going to start scoring again?I know the World Cup has been great fun. But does anybody actually ENJOY watching England – unless they’re 3-0 up? It’s too terrifying.Anyway, apparently there is a sharp rise in the birth rate when England win important football matches.Blokes take to their beds filled with passion.Me too, as it happens. And I like to relive the match by providing a loud commentary, in the manner of Jonathan Pearce, while I’m on the job.“Oh, just look at Liddle! He’s found a way through – AND IT’S IN!”ITALY has just turned away another ship full of migrants. It had been chartered by one of the many leftie charities bobbing about in the Med.Isn’t it time these mor- ons were prosecuted for people trafficking? Migrants now set off expecting to be picked up.

Migration Watch chair Lord Green stormed: “This immigration chapter is in many respects close to what we suggested but there are some weasel words.“It’s vital that the UK should not be drawn into a negotiation over numbers.“Indeed it is not enough to ‘control the number of migrant workers from the EU. These numbers must be significantly reduced.”Tory Eurosceptic Iain Duncan Smith demanded to know why the Government had dropped any mention of work permits – let alone visas.He told the Sun: “My fear is that the detail on immigration is being held back so we can negotiate controls away in a sop to the European Union. That would be an unmitigated disaster.”Key elements of Mrs Mays proposals include: The Sun five years ago urged then-PM David Cameron to win back powers to halt unlimited EU immigration –warning voters could otherwise vote to cut ties with Brussels.Figures two months ago revealed net migration in the year to September was 244,000 –more than double the Government’s 100,000 target.New Home Secretary Sajid Javid this week signalled the target would be scrapped in the run up to the next Election in 2022.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

People in other places are allowed them in their community gardens. Theres nothing in the tenancy agreement that says we cant.Weve even said we will sign a disclaimer to take responsibility for it.I dont know what the problem is, we have got a really nice block where everyone gets on and this is a nice way for everyone to enjoy the sunshine.Neighbours clubbed together to buy the pool, which takes around three hours to fill 15,000 gallons, as a way to bring the community together around a month ago.But mhs Homes told the residents to empty the pool each day to make it safe each night.The block is made up of six flats and the pool is used by the grandchildren of residents living in the flats.Maria suffers with a spine disease and relaxing in the pool and doing some exercise helps with her condition.She added: It relaxes my body and I cant afford to go swimming so this gives me the little bit of exercise I need.We all get on really well.We sit out the back together and socialise. Its completely enclosed.Theres no way Im taking it down. Theyll have to carry me out laying in it.Maria says the problems arouse when a security gate to the communal area broke, which meant people from outside could easily get inside the back area of the flats.Colette McKenney, housing manager of mhs Homes, said the firm had to be sure that everyone who has access to that land is safe.She said: While its really lovely to see people coming together as a community, we have to be sure that everyone who has access to that land is safe.This summer were having extreme weather and its very hot. But the pool is on land owned by us and were responsible for everyones safety.Were telling residents that the pool needs to be taken down and well be speaking to them about how they can safely enjoy a paddling pool in a communal area.Pools in private gardens and small childrens paddling pools in communal gardens are fine so long as children are always accompanied and its emptied when not being used.We dont want to spoil anyones fun, which is why were going to talk to our residents about trying to make this safe.The housing association landlord has since said management will consider allowing the residents to keep the pool if it is enclosed by a locked fence."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000419888052.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ambulance parking ticket driffield yorkshire","story":"Stunned shoppers looked on in disbelief after the jobsworth slapped the fine on the emergency vehicles windscreen yesterday afternoon.The ambulance had been parked on double yellow lines near to a Thomas Cook branch on Driffield high street, East Yorks. for two hours, while paramedics helped the patient to hospital.Passersby confronted the warden while she was issuing the ticket but were told he will have to appeal it.Mum-of-three Emily Dean, 27, caught the incident on camera.Emily, who was shopping with her mum and auntie when she spotted several people huddling around the attendant, said: I was quite shocked, you dont expect to see an ambulance with a ticket on the windscreen.A few people were trying to tell the parking attendant that the paramedic had gone off in an ambulance.

Jordan seemed a decent lad, polite and well mannered, but we rarely saw him.He was shut away in the house and was never out on the streets messing around with the other kids.”The neighbour added: “You could often hear screaming and shouting and one of my mates who visited Dawn said the house was filthy, cram packed with junk and like a pig sty.”Jordan died of malnutrition, immobility and infection-riddled sores on June 30, 2016.Newly-released photos show the victim - who would have celebrated his 21st birthday last week - enjoying himself at home.In one image unveiled by West Yorkshire Police bespectacled Jordan, sporting a black beanie, appears like any other normal teen and is captured with a huge grin on his fourteenth birthday in his lounge.Another picture shows a relaxed and healthy looking Jordan, aged 16, engrossed in playing on Playstation Portable, while a third snap shows a chubby-faced Jordan, aged 14.But within several years of the images being taken Jordan had wasted away at the hands of his wicked family.In one of the last photographs taken of the teen and released by his dad Steven Burling - who is estranged from Dawn - he can be seen holding up his shirt - with his ribs clearly seen in his starved state.Another photograph reveals the squalid conditions the young man was forced to live in before his death, with the living room piled high with rubbish.But despite the young man desperately malnourished, the court was told the home had three refrigerators or freezers, all stocked with food.The family also revealed their shock at discovering Dawn Cranston had given birth to another baby boy who died - hiding his body in a rucksack at their Leeds home.Police had found the babys remains after searching the house, with Dawn admitting before the trial to concealing a birth by hiding her newborns remains in a bedroom cupboard.She told the court she was completely unaware she was pregnant until she began to feel something really heavy in her body.She gave birth within an hour and began to panic as nobody else knew she was expecting.Describing how she did not call for help despite other people being in the house, she tearfully said: If I remember rightly, I dont think its eyes were open. I heard no noise, nothing. There were no signs at all of life.She claimed that she had intended to bury the remains, but did not get round to it and was unable to as there were always other people around.She admitted a charge of endeavouring to conceal a birth at the start of her trial last month.Jordans sister Abigail Burling, 25, was cleared of manslaughter but guilty of causing or allowing the death of a vulnerable person and jailed for 18 months.During the four week trial, prosecutor Nicholas Lumley QC had told the jury: The fault lies with each of the accused.What met the eyes of the paramedics was a shocking and disturbing scene.Jordan was lying, utterly helpless, on an inflatable mattress in a cluttered living room.He was little more than skin and bones, he weighed 37kg, less than six stones.He wore a soiled nappy under some pyjamas.The expert dietitian said they had never seen such malnutrition in 26 years and likened the condition of the body to that found in WWII extermination camps.His heart stopped, his life could not be saved.He he expired in that living room.Dawn Cranston already admitted to concealing the birth of a child by secretly disposing of a body.Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Bryar, of West Yorkshire Police Homicide and Major Enquiry Team today said the teens death was completely unnecessary.She said: We are in no doubt that Jordan would still be alive today if those convicted of allowing him to literally waste away and die in front of them had sought the medical attention he so obviously needed.Why they chose to ignore the terrible state he was in has not been explained in any reasonable way and remains something only they know.It is almost beyond belief that his mother, grandmother and sister, who should have had his best interests at heart, would allow him to slowly decline towards a death that could so easily have been avoided.Today, dad Steven said he felt betrayed, having never known about the baby.The statement read: As a family, we feel we have been denied any knowledge of that baby boy’s existence.The family said they now wanted to be able to grieve in peace.In a final tribute to Jordan, his family said: Steven and the family will always remember Jordan having a bubbly and chatty personality.Jordans dad Steven had previously shared a statement in court, read out by his sister Susan Burling.In the devastating tribute, Steven told the court: I just cant understand why all these horrific things have happened to me and my family.I have lost all my children and I don’t know how I’m supposed to deal with all this trauma.I don’t know how I’m going to grieve for them or rebuild my life."},{"url":null,"title":"hannibal oceja anthony loreana martinez starved child","story":"Hannibal Oceja suffered a fatal cardiac arrest in February, weighing just five pounds.That is one pound, seven ounces less than Hannibal weighed when he was born.A coroner ruled he had died of failure to thrive, undernourishment and insufficient fluid intake.The boy’s parents Anthony Oceja, 30, and Loreana Martinez, 25, were charged with murder on Tuesday.First responders who treated Hannibal reported that his “bones could easily be seen, his spinal cord appeared as if it was about to poke out of his skin and his rib cage could easily be seen.”A paramedic who turned up at the couple’s home in Las Vegas, Nevada, even had to ask if the baby was five weeks or five months old, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported.Martinez insisted that her son was a “perfectly healthy” on multiple occasions and claimed her two other children had “developed small”, according to the report.She denied that she was asked by a doctor to supplement Hannibal’s breast milk last December, and insists she breastfed multiple times a day.The mum also disputed an arrest report which said she missed several doctor’s appointments for Hannibal in the weeks leading up to his death.Social services did not investigate the family before the boy died.Along with murder his parents have been charged with abuse of their two year-old daughter, and three year-old son, who have been taken into care.The couple also face an animal cruelty charge over alleged neglect of their two dogs."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000419568628.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"government approves 21st century fox buy sky rupert murdoch","story":"The green light comes as bidding for the broadcaster hots up.On Wednesday evening, US cable group Comcast tabled a £14.75 bid for Sky, valuing it at £26 billion.Yesterday’s UK government clearance  after a 19 month wait eliminates a critical obstacle to Fox’s pursuit of Sky -

They still had light. They looked in good health.“But of course when we departed all we could think of was how we were going to get them out.“So there was relief tempered with uncertainty.”Rick was joined at the news conference by other members of the British Cave Rescue Council who were at the “forefront of the rescue effort”.Asked about the difficulty of the mission, the experienced cave diver admitted that the extraction process was “too detailed” to explain at such short notice.However, Rick did admit that the rescue team did have doubts over whether the boys would survive the operation.He said: “This is completely uncharted unprecedented territory – nothing likes this has been done. So of course there were doubts.“But I knew we had a good team with good support from the Thai authorities and the national caving community and rescue organisations.“So we had the best that we could do to make a plan work.”Rick found the youth football team along with fellow British cave diver John Volanthen, 47.The boys were soon joined by Australian doctor Richard Harris, known as Harry, who spent days with the youngsters checking them over and reassuring them before their dramatic evacuation.And John said that Dr Harris Aussie accent helped calm the children during the terrifying ordeal, reports the Adelaide Advertiser.He said: Dr Harry, the Australian doctor, hes very good, hes got a very good bedside manner, hes got a very bouncy Australian accent, and they seemed to find that quite relaxing and reassuring.The boys and their coach planned to explore the cavern complex for only about an hour before treacherous flood waters rose to trap them for more than two weeks, one of the boys fathers said.All 12 of the boys and their 25-year-old coach were brought to safety over the course of a three-day rescue.They had gone into the Tham Luang cave in the northern province of Chiang Rai on June 23, for a quick excursion after football practice, when a rainy season downpour flooded the tunnels.He told me that as soon as they finished practice they went to play at the cave. They thought theyd only be an hour, Banpot Korncam, father of the 13-year-old captain of the Wild Boars team, told media.While they were inside the cave it rained, water flowed in and everyone took off, Banpot said."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000420084215.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"can you find the pooch perfectly hidden among the flowers in its owners garden","story":"Staffordshire Bull Terrier Eddie almost disappeared entirely from view after getting spooked - but can you spot where he is?Owner Mike Simcox took the snap at his Birmingham home.He said: Although he is a Staffie, he can be quite nervous and most of the time he has a slightly scared look on his face.He has an extreme dislike of loud noises, especially fireworks and thunder.During storms in the past he has gone upstairs and hid in the shower cubicle.On close inspection the top of Eddie’s head and eyes can be seen in the centre of the pic surrounded by potted plants.Mike added: My mum and I were watering the garden when she spotted him peeping out from behind the flowers.She said you should take a photo and see if people could spot him, so I did.There was a really threatening-looking cloud above me at the time so its possible Eddie could hear thunder and decided to hide, although why he decided to hide outside and not in the house I couldnt say.It comes as a bizarre caterpillar with the head of a mouse was captured on camera.The eye-opening sight has quickly notched up over 317,000 views on YouTube after footage of the weird larva went viral.Alexander Emelyanov, from the port city of Odessa in south-western Ukraine, witnessed the strange creature and grabbed his mobile phone to record it.He said: The surface of its skin is smooth, but not entirely, to be honest it feels a bit like the body of a snake.

It’s about celebrities improving their image.”Oh, but what record-breaking names they’d assembled.Robbie, Adele, Elton, Ed Sheeran, Coldplay and Stormzy, were just a few of those who didn’t attend.Blue, Coleen Nolan, Amber Davies, from last year’s Love Island, UB40, Kimberley Walsh and Tony Hadley, on the other hand, were all involved, as was JLS’s Aston Merrygold, right, who said, on behalf of the NHS, he was: “Happy to clear my diary.”So we thank him and whoever covered the shift at Domino’s.Job demarcation, though, among the celebs, was a bit vague. A few just seemed to have backing track duties, like Kimberley Walsh who was given the line “What would you do if I sang out of tune?” (IF?)Some were enrolled for the full, record-breaking, Abbey Road finale, while others went on recruitment drives at UK hospitals, where Tony unearthed “the singing ambulanceman”, and Sara set her sights on Debbie “who’s pouring custard on a spotted Dick” — in the staff canteen, rather than the Infectious Diseases Unit.Eulogies to the great NHS god, though, were compulsory and delivered with a glassy-eyed, lip-quivering intensity that has become a very familiar sight these past few months.Good intentions, as we know, though, pave the road to hell. And so it proved with Wednesday’s Big Singalong Live, which kicked off with a parp of a klaxon, from Ashley, and Sara screaming: “Can we now please break that record.”Perhaps we can put what followed down to the swirling p***storm, in North London, or the lack of practice time — they only had six weeks — but, dear Lord in heaven — Russell Crowe didn’t unleash this much hell in Gladiator.Missed cues, frozen screens, flat voices, Tony Hadley giving it the big ’un, on the Abbey Road zebra crossing, with his “woh-oh ohhhs”.Seven thousand drunk Millwall fans chanting: “You’re going home in a London ambulance” could not have been much less unco-ordinated, but would undoubtedly have delivered an equally powerful message about the NHS.Salvation, though, was on hand in the form of Sara Cox.“The results are in and . . . (drum roll).“We almost made it, but it looks like the weather may have rained on our parade. We didn’t break the record.” A MASTERCLASS in scheduling, editing and continuity, from Channel 5, on Thursday night, that began with the very chirpy announcement: “We’ll find out What Happened to Josef Fritzl after brand new Nando’s, A PERi PERi Big Success . . . ”Which isn’t the first thing I associate Josef with, to be perfectly honest with you.

Started off at 5.47am and finished at 7.53pm, trying to make the absolute most of the new moon spring tides.I\u0027ll be doing two swims a day and slingshotting around Land\u0027s End. The sea was kind this morning with virtually no jellyfish (although support swimmer Nicola Johnson was stung on her arm).I will be going back out at around 6pm to catch the evening tide. Meanwhile, the team and I are motoring back into Newlyn harbour for the day to rest, refuel, stock up on food and fill up on water.:: Day one - 6 miles (9.8km) Today was a day of ironing out the swim procedures. This involved working out communication between me in the water and my team, adhering to the verification protocols, working out actual distance covered versus distance swum - it\u0027s difficult to swim in an exact straight line.In total I manage to cover 6 miles (9.8km) of my journey, although this is less than the actual distance I swam.This was the first day when all nine members of the campaign were on board, and over the next few days we will learn much about the teamwork and processes that will help us get through the entire expedition.Another first today was my first jellyfish sting. It got me right on the crotch.We ended the day by sitting at anchorage just off Mousehole, finishing up dinner and getting in an early sleep before we move back to the GPS point at 4.30 am for the next swim at 6.00am.:: The eve of the swimYou are either a pioneer or a follower you can\u0027t be both. And if you are a pioneer, you know all about worry.If something has been done before, you know it\u0027s possible. If you don\u0027t know something is possible, you worry about it.I have a plan to try and swim 10km per day. But when I swim into my first bloom of jellyfish, that plan will become flexible.I know that I\u0027m going to get sunburnt. I\u0027m going to be frozen, I\u0027m going to be stung, and I\u0027m going to become mentally and physically exhausted. Have I done too much preparation, or not enough?What if we get the tides wrong, get caught in a counter eddy and find ourselves going backwards? This is a notoriously dangerous coastline, with the shipwrecks to prove it.Did I mention that half my expedition team is new, and half has no sailing experience?In those waking worry hours I also remembered the Stockdale paradox. Admiral Stockdale was an American pilot who was shot down in Vietnam and spent eight years in a POW camp. He said that the people who survived had two important qualities.First, they always believed they would be freed. Second - and this is the paradox - they had no optimism. Because the people who did have optimism - the people who hoped they would be free by Easter, then by Thanksgiving, then by Christmas, and had those hopes dashed over and over again - those people didn\u0027t survive. The people who survived were the ones who confronted the brutal reality of their situation.I have to face some brutal facts when I look at the chart of our 560km swim route. This is the longest swim anyone has ever done, adhering to Channel Rules in water this low temperature. I honestly don\u0027t know how I\u0027m going to do this. But I do believe I\u0027ll see the white cliffs of Dover. So that\u0027s the paradox that\u0027s going through my mind.The swimming is only part of the challenge. We\u0027ve also had to co-ordinate with sponsors, raise funds for the expedition, recruit the right people for the team, and deal with the media... all the while juggling private lives with unexpected domestic crises. As if all that wasn\u0027t enough, after six months of campaign planning and preparation, we learned that Donald Trump is coming to London on the day I start swimming. We certainly hadn\u0027t planned on such a big media story distracting from our message.Because the message is the reason I am doing this swim. The truth is we are failing our oceans. And it\u0027s only through bold and courageous action that we\u0027re going to be able to protect them properly. \"Piecemeal\" protection is not going to safeguard our seas. We need an enormous shift in business and government and the public to be able to do this.There are challenges ahead. But as English Channel crossing pioneer Captain Webb said, nothing great is ever easy.I\u0027ll keep that in mind as I strike out for Dover."},{"url":null,"title":"eu chief jean claude juncker","story":"NewsEU chief Jean-Claude Juncker was stumbling so much he had to be helped by leaders ahead of NATO summit dinnerThe European Union Commission President, 63, was swaying so much the presidents of Finland and Ukraine had to prop him up\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent20:51, 12 JUL 2018Updated20:57, 12 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJean-Claude Juncker was seen stumbling and losing his balance before a dinner at the NATO summit in Belgium. The European Union Commission President, 63, had to be helped by the presidents of Finland and Ukraine had to prop him up. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte also stepped in to help the stumbling Commission chief at the event in Brussels on Wednesday night. Mr Juncker has said he suffers from sciatica that sometimes affects his movements. A video of the wobbly Eurocrat emerged after it was tweeted out by a far right German politician.    Martin Reichardt, from the Alternative for Germany party, tweeted that several people needed to support the EC President. And he said that Mr Juncker was seemingly too drunk to stand.  He called Mr Juncker\u0027s appearance shameful. Dutch PM Mark Rutte, who helped Mr Juncker, told Belgian news outlet VRT: “As far as I know, he [Juncker] has no serious health problems, but he has had a back problem for a while.” The Eurocrat denied claims of alcoholism in a 2016 interview where he guzzled four glasses of champagne. He said: “You think I’d still be in office if I was having cognac for breakfast?  “It really makes me sad and it has even led my wife to question if I lie to her, as I do not drink when I’m home.” Revealing past health problems, he added: “I have a balance problem with my left leg that requires me to grab the rail when on a staircase. “This problem goes back to a serious car accident.

And rents could rocket from 2021, depending on fresh negotiations with military chiefs. The Commons Public Accounts Committee said the deal, covering 55,000 homes, has been “disastrous”, offering “no protection against the private firm making huge gains at taxpayers’ expense”.  MPs say the firm’s annual 13.4% return “is out of line with the limited risks Annington took on, fuelled by greater than forecast house price rises”.

Ceri Poulton, 31, ballooned to a size 20 by gorging on chocolate for breakfast and scoffing kebabs, crisps, chips and pizza, sending her weight rocketing to over 15st after leaving secondary school. She said: “I have always been a big girl. Throughout school I was so overweight that when the boys found out I was playing Juliet in the school play none of them wanted to play Romeo and we had to get a girl to play the role. “I was 11-years-old, in Year Six and I heard all the boys say ‘no, I’m not doing it. It was pretty embarrassing.  “Secondary school was easier for me. I used my quick wit and humour to gain popularity and my weight didn’t feel like such a big deal anymore. “I slowly gained weight through the 10 years following until I had my daughter in 2009 when I hit 15st 2.5lb. My daughter’s christening photos sent me into shock. One day I had purchased a size 20 dress from Primark because I couldn’t find anything nice in my size. At 5ft 8, I suit being a little bigger but that was beyond crazy.  “I had sunk into a pattern of eating when I was tired, using my daughter as an excuse to not exercise. “I never exercised. I ate chocolate for breakfast, and I loved kebabs, crisps, chips and pizza – all the bad carbs! “I wanted to change. My mum was unfit and overweight and as much as I adored her, I wanted something different for my own daughter. I wanted her to be healthy.  After the birth of her daughter and her mum’s terminal cancer diagnosis Ceri decided to turn her life around and embraced a healthy lifestyle. She lost more than four stone, started to exercise, retrained professionally and landed her dream job at a hospital where she met her ‘soulmate’. “I never thought anyone would want to marry me but now I’m planning my dream wedding with my perfect partner and I’m so happy, said Ceri.  Her real life Romeo, Lewis, an electrician, strode into her life one day to fix a fan in the office. “At first I thought he was grumpy but then I noticed that he was very good looking. So I glanced at his name badge and looked him up on Facebook. “I messaged him and said I thought he was very good looking, and embarrassingly he asked who I was. After a few messages I asked him out on a date and he said he’d think about it! “Then the next week he messaged me back and said he’d love to go on a date.  Recalling their first date together, Ceri said: We went to a country pub. We sat by the fire and chatted over a drink, it was amazing. When we were leaving he asked if I’d walk with him to the boot of his car. I wondered if he was going to murder me and stuff me in it! But when he opened it there was a huge bunch of flowers which he gave to me. “He told my daughter, Jasmine, months before he proposed that he was going to ask me to marry him. We’re so close it was torture for her not to tell me. Every time we passed a place she knew I wanted to get married in she’d say ‘Mummy, there’s something I really want to tell you but I can’t.’ “So I had an inkling that he might be thinking about it. Then we went on holiday together and I was sure he would ask me then. I made sure I looked proper nice every day but nothing happened. When we got home from the airport I was devastated. “Then weeks later we went to a restaurant in Dartmoor to celebrate our third year anniversary. When we got back we sat in the car for a while just chatting and enjoying the peace.  “He asked me to get him something from the glove compartment and there was a ring. He said ‘Ceri Poulton, will you marry me?’ “And I said ‘yes’ immediately before he could change his mind! “He really is amazing. If I die tomorrow I’ll die happy knowing that my daughter is well cared for. The couple will tie the knot surrounded by family and friends in a Christmas ceremony in November next year. I’ve been dress shopping but I haven’t decided exactly what I want yet. I tried on really tight fitting dresses which looked amazing but I love dancing and eating so I think I’ll go for something less restrictive like a princess style in the end.” Ceri\u0027s fairytale ending comes after months of hard work and determination to lose weight.  “In 2009 I saw a billboard outside the local church which advertised a Slimming World class. I decided to go and check it out and I’ve never looked back. “I steadily lost weight over the next two years, just by changing the way I was cooking, walking more and treating myself once a week after weigh-in so I wasn’t missing out.” Ceri found Slimming World a hugely supportive environment and the more targets she hit, the more she wanted to smash the next weight-loss goal. “Losing the first stone was slow. I still treated myself a lot and wasn’t really that bothered about it.

For the best part of the last decade the leading players on the high street use this month to highlight the best in party food, pigs in blankets and mince pies in their equivalent to fashion week. Now there is an avalanche of ‘seasonal’ food gimmicks, giving all sorts of items a festive twist to create some very unlikely - and possibly unpalatable - combinations.  It all started when experimental chef Heston Blumenthal opened the floodgates in 2010 with his bestselling ‘hidden orange’ pudding, which concealed a candied fruit. And in a world where competition has never been sharper, the shows are now a crucial battleground especially among the discount retailers like Aldi, Lidl and Iceland. Neil Nuggent, head of product development at Iceland, said: “Our show-stopping centrepieces have been given a mouth-watering makeover. “But we’re not just conscious about what we eat, we are also thinking about how our food impacts the world. We’re really proud to be totally free from palm oil this Christmas.”  Lynsey Taylor, senior director for new product development at Asda, added: “This year we’ve spent time creating extra special twists on traditional classics, whilst perfecting festive staple dishes we wouldn’t dream of changing.” Here we look at what is on the menu for you later this year... LUXURY ITEMS  The cost of a lobster and Champagne were previously the weapons retailers battled it out with at Christmas to in order to win-over customers. But this year caviar will join the list with its Yorkshire-bred ethically sourced version. A 10g tin is expected to sell for \u0026pound30. TWIST ON A CLASSIC The 1970s dinner party stable of Black Forest gateau will be hard to avoid this Christmas as the retro dessertgets a modern twist. Iceland has a Luxury Black Forest layered pavlova while Aldi has Black Forest flavoured mince pies. Tesco has gone the whole hog with 12 Finest Black Forest profiteroles decorated with red glitter, as well as a Black Forest meringue wreath. SALTED CARAMEL  Prosecco stole the show last year as the flavouring for a range of crisps, cheeses and turkeys. This year salted caramel will dominate supermarket aisles. Aldi has a Salted Caramel Christmas pudding, with accompanying salted caramel vodka which is poured over the dessert before setting it alight. Iceland has a salted caramel Christmas tree cheescake, while Tesco has packs of salted caramel and coca tortilla chips as well as a salted caramel snack mix - made up of pretezels, chocolate buttons and nuts covered in, yes you’ve guess it, salted caramel. Meanwhile, Asda has gone the whole hog with a chocolate and salted caramel Wensleydale cheese. If you are not sick of the sight of it, the chain will also sell Extra Special Belgian dark chocolate and salted caramel pots of gold. INSTAGRAM-WORTHY  Think sushi with a modern twist for Iceland’s luxury mini doughnuts - taking the frozen’s food chain a million miles away from a Kerry Katona prawn ring. Keep kids entertained with their decorate-your-own Rudolph macarons kit. Asda’s gingerbread man mouse looks too good to eat. It is sculptured out of sweet chocolate mouse, laid on a biscuit and caramel base and coated in white chocolate and bronze shimmer. The chain’s Extra Special melt in the middle chocolate and salted caramel (yes, more) pyramid pudding is worth getting your hand on if you are looking for a centrepiece showstopper. CHEESE  No longer just happy with a slap of cheese on your board, the supermarkets have has given the after-dinner staple a makeover too. Waitrose has given Wensleydale the treatment by adding caramelised orange and gin, while its white Stilton star has berries and candied orange. Tesco will sell a Christmas pudding truckle which is a white Stilton with cinnamon, raisins and rum. And Asda’s offering is a cabra al vino - a mild goats cheese bathed in red wine giving it a festive colour. PIGS IN BLANKETS  Asda has take the family favourite to place it at the centre of the table with a super-sized Extra Special ultimate pig in blanket which will serve up to 10 people. It consists of a loin of pork wrapped with rashers of British dry cure oak smoked streaky bacon. Aldi has its own foot-long version. SUPER-SIZE BOOZE  Aldi will sell a methuselah of Prosseco - that is the equivalent of eight normal bottles but might be slightly impractical to pour though. Iceland has Magnums of Colossal Reserva, a Portuguese red bursting with red fruit with a smooth oaky vanilla finish. ADVENT CALENDARS Aldi will release a beauty version full off its candles and body creams that closely resemble the upmarket brand Jo Malone. They will arrive in store in November but be warned - each brand will only stock 10 calendars each.

Albert and Phyllis Twinley, 95 and 91, met in 1946 while serving together with the Royal Corps of Signals. After leaving the Army the couple, who have two children, four grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren, ran a butchers \u0026shybusiness together. The Twinleys celebrated their platinum wedding anniversary this week with family and friends. Phyllis said: “There’s no secret. We’re just happily married.

He added: “Bear with one another when things go a little bit wrong.” Radio communications expert Albert served in the Far East during the Second World War and Phyllis was a telephonist. They met in North London while working as company quartermaster sergeants. They lived in Kent and Sussex before retiring 30 years ago to Essex, where they live in Kirby Cross. Their daughter Caroline Gard, of nearby Frinton, said: “They still live at home and my father was driving until two years ago.

The police watchdog is investigating claims Andre Moura was kneed in the head \u0027several times\u0027 by an officer before his death. Ten officers are on restricted duties and mobile phone footage of the incident has been seized as part of the probe. Mr Moura, 30, was detained on suspicion of breaching the peace following reports of a domestic disturbance at his home on Seventh Avenue in Oldham, Manchester.  Greater Manchester Police said officers used CS spray to restrain Mr Moura outside his house before he was taken to Ashton-under-Lyne police station. The force said that ‘on arrival’ at the station, Mr Moura was ‘found unresponsive in the back of the police van’, the Manchester Evening News reported. He was then taken to Tameside hospital, where he was declared dead at 1.30am. A post-mortem was ‘inconclusive’. Further tests will be carried out to determine the cause of Mr Moura’s death.  Police arrived at the scene at around 11.30pm last Friday (July 6). Footage of the arrest was captured by a resident. In it, Mr Moura can be heard screaming and telling officers they had ‘hurt’ him. One of Mr Moura’s neighbours, who shot the video, is heard asking police: “Is he alright? “You just kneed him about... several times [sic].”  An officer replies: “Yeah, I know pal.” The resident, Barry Lee Martin, is then heard saying: “It was a little excessive him kneeing him then.”  An officer replies: “Yeah, you stood here scrapping with him? No. Go back in your house, pal.” Earlier in the video, an officer can be heard shouting: “Put your hands behind your back. Stop resisting or you’re gonna get sprayed again.” Mr Moura is heard shouting ‘help me, help’.

Gone were the steelworks and factories which had seen the area thrive at the heart of the industrial revolution. The train station, which had once seen thousands of workers on its platform every day, was run down and dilapidated, and the high street was filled with rows of boarded up shops. Now, it is a very different place – almost every shop is open for business, colourful hanging baskets adorn each shop front and the railway station has a bustling cafe and function room which would look good on a picture postcard. So how have these once dead-on-their-feet towns on the outskirts of Salford managed to pick themselves up and buck the trend of the struggling British high street to thrive again?  Their success is thanks in part to local lad and wealthy businessman Neil McArthur who launched his firms in the area and wanted to give something back. But, he says, the community itself has been instrumental in stopping the rot and transforming its own fortunes. “It is restoration of pride – that is the key to regeneration, getting people in the area to believe in the area,” he says. “You have to have a plan, a drive. The community have to get themselves together and organise. We have officers at the council who help enormously, but we drive it as a community.”  When Neil was born in 1955, Irlam was booming. Slap in the middle of the rail network and the ship canal, it was the perfect location for the steelworks and factories making everything from soap, to rope and margarine. But in the early 70s the steelworks closed, and in the space of eight years the other factories went too. “We lost the lot,” Neil says. “About 10,000 jobs. It decimated the area – it went from a place where thousands of people travelled in to the station everyday from places like Wigan to work in the steelworks, to nothing going on. You lose all that industry and disposable income, and then our shops slowly lost their income.” Part of Salford, it had a lower crime rate and was wealthier than its neighbours so went unnoticed by the authorities who left Irlam and Cadishead out on a limb. “The problem was it was never poor enough or deprived enough to get attention” says Neil, 63.  He launched his telecoms business, Opal, in 1996 – based in Irlam – and by 2002 it was bought by Carphone Warehouse and became TalkTalk. He had made enough money to put his feet up, but chatting to him in the railway station he has spent \u0026pound1.1million revamping, you get the impression that just isn’t his style. He’s a do-er. So he turned his attention to his home town. He ploughed \u0026pound12million into his charity, the Hamilton Davies Trust, and a further \u0026pound11million into a regeneration company that bought empty properties – including almost the whole high street – and giving them a lease of life. “We realised we just weren’t going to get any money out of the Government so we started this process called community-led regeneration.” He explains: “You start thinking about what you have got, not what you haven’t got. You start to stop the rot. We did a bit of a stocktake on what we had and the challenges. The thing that jumped out was that the housing stock was quite good. But the shopfronts and the road really let the area down.  “There was still quite a good community spirit here, but the image was poor. “An outsider coming in saw a boarded-up derelict station with weeds growing out of it, shops boarded up, and other things that tell you you are in a tired area. It started getting a reputation that wasn’t right. People who lived here loved it, but people who didn’t couldn’t understand why people wanted to live here. The first thing we did was our regeneration business would buy a derelict shop, do it up. “If you buy a couple of them then your neighbours start looking at theirs because it looks a bit tatty. “When you have done 30 of them people start to notice. We got rid of all the derelict shops.”  There is a \u0026pound3million leisure centre built with \u0026pound1million from the McArthur Trust, plus funding from the council and Sport England. There are green spaces and huge tubs filled with flowers in the high street. Each shop that spruces itself up gets a plaque and a hanging basket from the trust and Rotary Club. The town is thriving – but not like a high street in the traditional sense of the word. To survive, Irlam and Cadishead had to diversify. There is a huge Tesco and a Lidl right in the town centre, so the high street itself is focused on the service industry with everything from tattoo parlours to dog grooming salons, accountants, sandwich shops and hairdressers. Florist Luana Saycell has had her shop, Green Orchid, for six years and says everyone in the town pulls together to foster pride and success.  “The Hamilton Davies Trust has tried to help Irlam in a big way,” she says. “But we are all trying to work together. It is a team effort. I sell the local honey that is made by a beekeeper who keeps his hives on local farmland. It is hard in business, you have to diversify to survive.” Louise English, 64, started outside catering business Festival of Food from her house in 1999 and then expanded to open a sandwich shop in Irlam. Business is booming. “The town is improving, there is a lot of money being put in. The Rotary Club provided hanging baskets for the shops. The industrial estate keeps us going – we get phone orders all day. The businesses thrive off each other.” The railway station which was once dingy and uninviting is now the hub of the community and within a year of its refurbishment it saw passenger numbers increase by 50,000.

Maria Young and her neighbours clubbed together and bought the 12ft pool and cover for \u0026pound64 during the heatwave last month.  Their children and grandkids have enjoyed cooling off in the sweltering 30C temperatures. But this week killjoy housing officials told them it must go — because it is not safe for intruders. Mrs Young, 47, said: They said if someone breaks in they might drown in the pool.  A team of them came and said initially we\u0027d have to get rid of it. They then changed their mind and said we had to put it down each night for health and safety issues. I don\u0027t understand. People in other places are allowed them in their community gardens. There\u0027s nothing in the tenancy agreement that says we can\u0027t. We\u0027ve even said we will sign a disclaimer to take responsibility for it. I don\u0027t know what the problem is, we have got a really nice block where everyone gets on and this is a nice way for everyone to enjoy the sunshine.  She added: We all get on really well. We sit out the back together and socialise. It\u0027s completely enclosed. There\u0027s no way I\u0027m taking it down. They\u0027ll have to carry me out laying in it. The residents of the six flats in Strood, Kent, bought the paddling pool to bring the community together. It takes around three hours to fill and holds up to 15,000 gallons of water. But mhs Homes, which manages the properties, said it had to be sure that everyone who has access to that land is safe. The problems arouse when a security gate to the shared garden broke recently, which meant people from outside could easily get inside the back area of the flats.

Paul Jones, 50, wrote the moving letter days after son Michael Jones, 21, is understood to have fallen over railings at an apartment block in Benidorm. In the note he tells other parents to cherish your children, tell them that you love them deeply - you never know if and when they will be taken from you.

Promising young footballer Michael, from Little Lever, Bolton, was on the academy books of both Manchester United and Manchester City as a child and went on to play semi-professionally and at a high amateur level. He was enjoying a holiday with friends when tragically on July 4, at around 11pm, he is belueved to have fallen to his death from Apartamentos Vina Del Mar hotel, just outside central Benidorm. Michael’s father Paul Jones, 50, shared his heartbreak and announced his son\u0027s death in a moving Facebook post this week, reports the Manchester Evening News . He said the family were ‘broken’ over Michael’s passing and revealed the friends he was with on holiday all returned home immediately afterwards.  Paul and his family have flown out to Spain to organise his repatriation and speak with the authorities. The former Little Lever High School pupil had been playing in the first team at Bolton-based Little Lever Sports Club in the Lancashire Amateur League. A match between the club and Walshaw Sports Club has been scheduled for this Saturday at Little Lever’s Mytham Road ground and a GoFundMe campaign to help the family has also been launched. Michael leaves parents Paul and Kath, step-mum Janet, brothers Joseph and Robert and two sisters, Elisabeth and Sarah. Funeral or repatriation details haven’t yet been announced.

I ask that those of you who see this and that were close to ‘Mike’ share this so that it reaches all of the rest of his friends.  On the 16th October 1996 I was given the first of two gifts, gifts of life, Michael my eldest son was born at Bolton Hospital. Earlier this week my beautiful baby boy died whilst on a ‘lads holiday’ in Benidorm, he died alone from injuries sustained from a horrific accident that no one could have foreseen, understand that there is no blame to lay at anybody’s feet. We met with Mike\u0027s friends on Saturday, they returned early from the holiday, devastated by the loss of a close friend. We met with the boys and their parents to fill in the gaps of the last hours of Mikes last day, to get a better understanding of the events of the day leading up to his death, to search for a better understanding and help to get some sort of closure.  I thank the boys with all my heart for their time with us, they helped me enormously, I take solace in their words, they need each other now along with their families and must not blame themselves for something totally out of their control. My wife Janet, son Joseph, family, friends and colleagues have been a massive support over the nightmare of the past few days, thank you all for your kind words. I am broken and feel so alone, I can’t see the pain ending, a part of me died with Michael, never to be replaced or healed, no parent should have to bury their child, it’s just not right, it’s not fair. I told Mike I loved him with every opportunity I had and meant every word, I hope he understood just how much he meant to me. I cannot explain how much this hurts. As you can imagine Kathryn, Sarah, Robert, Joseph and Elisabeth are struggling through these sad sad times, collectively, all we can do is look to get through each day as best we can.

Megan Bassett was travelling home from Weston-super-Mare\u0027 s beach with her family when she discovered a massive lump on her neck, the Bristol Post reports  Concerned by its size, the 26-year-old sought medical advice and after scans she was eventually diagnosed with Stage 4 Hodgkins Lymphoma which had spread to various parts of her body. It was only when Megan looked back at photos taken at the beach that she noticed a picture of her daughter Marnie, aged 22 months, holding her neck with an anxious expression on her face. Megan said: “This photo was taken only a couple of hours before I found the lump. I find it really strange how she was holding my neck exactly where the lump was with a slightly concerned look on her face, it’s as if she was trying to give me a little sign…”   In her own words on the JustGiving page , Megan said: “When the day arrived to discuss my results I was so scared we arrived at the hospital earlier than our appointment and we were called in straight away -never a good sign - and a doctor was sat waiting for me.  I felt like I was going to faint I can’t really remember what he first said but all I heard was I’m afraid to say that you have the Hodgkins lymphoma. It’s cancer and you will need chemo for your treatment.” “I broke down, it felt like my whole world around me was crashing and all I had in my head was my daughter Marnie, I need to be strong for her I need to get better for her. The journey home from the hospital was a blur I just went into some kind of strange daze and was hoping I would wake up soon and it all be a nightmare.  “I just kept thinking about how the hell am I supposed to look after a very energetic toddler whilst going through chemo, I want to be the best mum I can be to Marnie but how am I supposed to do that whilst trying to fight cancer? Another major concern of mine was how ugly I was going to look without my hair. I love my long hair and now that will be taken away from me as well. Megan had another devastating blow when she found out the cancer had spread to her neck, chest and liver. She said: I burst out in tears all I kept thinking was why me? I had so hoped in my head that it wouldn’t have gone to a stage 4 and then bang yet again more bad news. The reality of it all really sunk in then I was seen my one of the chemotherapy nurses and we had a long discussion. On the way out of the hospital I walked passed the chemotherapy suite and I just felt sick.  “I’m going to continue to blog throughout my chemotherapy treatment as I want to share my story and help raise awareness. when I was diagnosed I was constantly searching the internet to look at other people’s experience with going through chemo and fighting cancer in a way it gave me some hope and comfort that you are not alone so I want to do the same on my page. I want to document my battle so I can also look back on it and remember that I am a stronger person then I ever thought I could be.” "},{"url":null,"title":"small detail meghan markle prince","story":"NewsSmall detail in Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0027s royal tour photo which has people baffled - and concernedDuring their visit to Ireland, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex paid a visit to the Taoiseach\u0027s office\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor12:08, 12 JUL 2018Updated23:47, 12 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA royal tour may, at times, just look like a glorified taxpayer-funded jolly, but a LOT of work goes in to them.

In the astonishing clip, the pensioner even sits on the other passenger in a desperate bid to get her own way. The pair were filmed on the number 78 bus in London travelling from Shoreditch High Street to Peckham. The video begins with the pensioner – who carries a walking stick – standing over the woman who is sitting in ‘her’ seat on the bus. She yells: “You move!” but the seated woman calmly responds saying: “I’m not getting off here.” The pensioner angrily retorts back: “What do you mean you’re not gonna get off!”  Then shockingly, the furious old lady sits on the woman to force her to leave the seat.

Samantha Mulcahy, 32, from Folkestone, died suddenly earlier this month. Her family and friends say they have been overwhelmed by the support they have received over the past few weeks. Samantha lived in Hawkinge with her husband Ryan and died at the William Harvey Hospital on Wednesday, July 4. She had given birth to her daughter Thea just a week before.  Samantha worked at the Apples Nursery at the Saga Pavillion in Sandgate for around six years and had been much loved by her family, friends, colleagues and even the children she cared for at the nursery.  Close friend Thom McGarry, who spoke to Kent Live on behalf of the family, said: Sam was very well thought of.  Ryan will be an amazing dad and will really do Sam proud, and at the moment, everyone has been banding together. Everyone was shocked by Sam\u0027s death, but there is a real sense of support for Ryan to honour her memory. Mr McGarry along with Ryan\u0027s cousin Simon Kemp and Rob Laing set up a Just Giving page as a place for people to leave their memories and donate money in support of both Mr Mulcahy and newborn Thea. The initial target was \u0026pound6,000 which has been exceed by more than \u0026pound5,000 in just 48 hours. Alongside the donations, there have been countless messages of condolences from many people who knew Mrs Mulcahy, and others who have been affected by the tragic circumstances. Mr Kemp, one of the page admins, posted on Wednesday: Ryan and myself are completely overwhelmed at the love and support from everyone.  Sam touched so many people\u0027s lives, its been hard but lovely to read all the comments. We have all lost a special person.

But that does not mean we have to bow and scrape in his presence. The office of President of the United States deserves recognition, not the wayward personality who occupies it. Theresa May talked of shared values and mutual respect.  She should have reminded him that our values do not include retweeting posts by far-right groups, apologising for white supremacists and mocking the disabled. And she should have told him that mutual respect does not involve smearing your allies, attacking the NHS or starting a trade war that threatens British jobs and livelihoods.

While they can’t help with the first two, Halfords thankfully has a range of products to help keep your pride and joy gleaming in the sunshine. H2-No! Water is certainly a good way to wash a car. Hosepipe bans don\u0027t prevent you from filling a bucket but we also know that any frivolous water use is making the problem worse for everyone. According to Uswitch, washing a car with a hosepipe uses between 400 and 480 litres of water, whereas completing the same activity using a faithful bucket draws around 32 litres. But there are risks involved with using a bucket and sponge, too. Sponges can pick up harmful foreign objects which can damage the layers of laquer on the panels of the car. With that in mind, let\u0027s look at other options.  The ArmorAll Waterless Wash \u0026amp Spray, \u0026pound10, is designed to clean your car of light dirt and dust. Simply spray the sections of the car that you want to clean and then wipe them clean with a microfibre cloth. The spray helps lift the dirt from your bodywork and allows you to wipe it off without risking damage to the paintwork. It\u0027s a much more high-tech solution than using water and it\u0027s helping to save water during our heatwave too. You may need more than one bottle if your car is large, so bear that in mind before you start. Careful wiping    The first thing you\u0027ll need to remember is that dirt causes scratches if you\u0027re not careful. Make sure that you have a decent amount of microfibre cloths before you start. Halfords sell a five-pack for \u0026pound3, so you may want to pick up a couple. When you\u0027re wiping the spray off it\u0027s important to use a cloth only until it gets dirty. So fold your cloth in half and use it four times before putting it aside for washing later. It\u0027s also important to only wipe in one direction. This will help keep the dirt from scratching the paintwork. Take precautions  Once your car is clean it\u0027s a good idea to wax it. A coat of wax puts a barrier between the paint and the outside world to protect it from rainwater, spray and debris.

Archaeologists believe the woman was willingly entombed alive in order to accompany her husband to the next world. The extraordinary burial sees the couple clasped together since the Bronze Age. The pair, from the prehistoric Vysotskaya - or Wysocko - Culture were found near Petrykiv village, south of the city of Ternopil in western Ukraine. Professor Mykola Bandrivsky - who conducted a study of ‘loving couple burials’ - said: “It is a unique burial, a man and a woman lying there, hugging each other tight.  “Both faces were gazing at each other, their foreheads were touching. “The woman was lying on her back, with her right arm she was tenderly hugging the man, her wrist lying on his right shoulder. “The legs of the woman were bent at the knees - lying on the top of the men’s stretched legs. “Both the dead humans were clad in bronze decorations, and near the heads was placed some pottery items - a bowl, a jar and three bailers.” This ancient culture was known for the “tenderness” of its burials, said Dr Bandrivsky, Director of the Transcarpathian branch of the Rescue Archaeological Service of the Institute of Archeology of Ukraine.  But this example is very striking as autopsy experts say it would not be possible to place the woman’s body in such a loving position if she was already dead. The experts say it is likely the woman chose to die and be buried with her husband and drank poison as she climbed into the grave and embraced her recently dead husband. In other cases, burials from this culture have revealed “a man holding the hands of a woman, the lips of a man touching forehead of a woman, or arms of both dead people hugging each other”.  Dr Bandrovsky - who has carried out an analysis of such burials - said: “From our point of view, this women did it voluntarily. “Maybe, the woman did not want to live with some other man, and get used to some new way of life. “So she preferred to pass away with her husband. “We suppose such a decision was dictated only by her own desire, and her attempt to stay with her beloved one.” He added: “She may, for example, have drunk a chalice of poison to make joining her husband easy and painless.” Marriage was well developed in the Vysotskaya Culture, with husbands and wives having clearly defined responsibilities, he said. A tenet of their beliefs was the idea that thew woman preferred to die with her man.

The pair were seen with their mum and the unsettling find on remote Arctic island Svalbard. Despite a human population of only 2,500, outnumbered by polar bears, researchers found plastic waste everywhere. Claire Wallerstein, of Sail Against Plastic, said: “It was very sobering to see just how much plastic is making its way to this incredibly remote, apparently pristine environment.” The group of 15 Cornish scientists and campaigners spent 10 days examining air, sea and beaches around the Norwegian archipelago, some 600 miles from the North Pole, for microplastics and larger pieces.  Claire said: “The saddest thing was just how much of the waste blighting the Arctic is the same old disposable detritus of our daily lives – plastic bottles, cotton bud sticks, cigarette ends, wet wipes, polystyrene and food packaging.” With currents reaching Svalbard from both the Atlantic and Siberia, local beach cleaners have reportedly found plastic waste traceable even to Florida.  Flora Rendell-Bhatti, of the University of Exeter, said: “As plastic pollution breaks down it is harder to identify the sources of fragments and fibres by eye. “Once samples are analysed in the UK, this will indicate the microplastic pollution levels in Arctic waters around Svalbard.” "},{"url":null,"title":"alan gilzean wont be forgotten says dundee boss neil mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee manager Neil McCann says Alan Gilzean’s death is a “sad loss for the club” but the impact he made at Dens will never be forgotten.The club’s all-time top goalscorer and league- winning striker sadly passed away on Sunday at the age of 79.Speaking from the club’s training camp in Portugal, Neil said: “First of all, I would like to offer my condolences to the family.“Sometimes the word legend is thrown around too easily but Alan Gilzean is a legend in the true sense of the word.“I know first-hand about how important goalscorers are to clubs now I am a manager and, my goodness, could we have been doing with someone of his quality.“So, yes, it is a sad loss for the football club.“From when I first came into Dundee as a young boy from 12 years old and then after going full-time, you were always aware of the club’s history.“I never actually got to meet Gillie but when you know the history of the club you can see, clearly, the pride running through the place.“He will be forever remembered at Dundee, that’s for sure.“He won’t be forgotten and we know he made his mark as a footballer.“You don’t play football – well most of us don’t – for the fame and riches.

He was always the same nice lad.“I think that was one of the strengths of the Dundee team that won the championship – we were all good friends. There were no cliques in the dressing-room and none of us let our success go to our heads.“I remember when Alan was at Spurs and I was manager at Hearts, we played them in a friendly. He was a big star, but he was exactly the same as he was when we were at Dens.”“Gillie” scored a club record 169 goals in 190 appearances in dark blue and, after leaving for London in 1964, went on to earn similar legendary status at White Hart Lane, where he formed lethal striking partnerships with Jimmy Greaves and Martin Chivers. None of that came as a surprise to Seith, who rates him as one of the best ever.He said: “Alan was exceptional and a great header of the ball. His timing in the air was the thing and when he jumped he seemed to hang in the air. We knew that if we could get the ball to his head he would score goals.“At Dundee he had a fine partnership with Alan Cousin and he would have been the first to say Alan Cousin’s donkey work was responsible for him scoring as many goals as he did.“With Alan, though, it was not just about his heading, he had two very good feet as well. In fact, I was never sure whether he was left or right-footed.“He had the knack of being in the right place at the right time. He always seems to know where to be, that’s why he scored so many goals.”Former Dundee director and long-time friend, Dave Forbes, also paid tribute. Organiser of a number of events down the years to honour the 1961/62 team, he knew Gillie well.He said: “I knew he wasn’t well and I’m just glad it all seems to have been quite quick and he didn’t suffer for too long.”Particularly after spending 10 years in the limelight at Spurs, where he was dubbed the King of White Hart Lane, Gilzean was famous for valuing his privacy.For a long time after he retired, the native of Coupar Angus did not make many public appearances but, over the past decade or so, was a familiar figure at White Hart Lane on match days and made regular visits back to Dundee.“Gillie was a private man, but he was a gentleman.“I remember when we were organising Dundee’s centenary celebrations he was a big help,” added Forbes.“I am proud, honoured and privileged to have known him as a good friend.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4485911d088-685x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fans in portugal an inspiration for keeper jack hamilton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDens Park new boy Jack Hamilton says the sight of Dundee fans making the trip all the way to Portugal to watch their side is an inspiration.The Dark Blues have been in the Algarve since last Wednesday, playing a training game with Sunderland and another with Portuguese top-flight side Portimonense on Sunday before finishing things off with a friendly clash with local side SC Farense last night.That game is expected to draw some away support after a handful of supporters showed up for the 4-0 training game loss on Sunday at the Estadio Municipal de Albufeira.And that dedication to their team is something Hamilton wants to repay in the coming season.He said: “It says a lot for the fans to come out here.“They could have gone anywhere on holiday to be fair but they’ve come here to show the boys a bit of support and we really appreciate that.“It’s fantastic and, hopefully, we can repay them for coming to places like this with good results.”For Hamilton, as a new signing, the trip to Portugal has been a great way for him to get to know his team-mates a lot better. And he is eager to get going when the competitive games finally get under way this weekend away at Stirling Albion in the Betfred Cup.“It’s been good, I’m really enjoying it,” he added.“It’s a fantastic club, fantastic fanbase as well. Everyone has made me feel welcome, the boys are brilliant with me and the manager and staff are really good.“I’m enjoying it and just desperate to get back out on the park and get playing again.“The facility is brilliant, the hotel is nice, food and everything is good – it’s everything you want and it’s good to get the boys all together.“Being a new boy as well, it’s good to be able to get to know everybody that wee bit better and getting a better understanding with everybody, I’m really enjoying it.”Hamilton started Sunday’s game against Portimonense in Albufeira before being replaced halfway through by Elliott Parish with the score at 1-0.The final scoreline of 4-0 flattered the Portuguese side a little and Hamilton insists there was plenty of good work done to help their preparations for the coming campaign.“It wasn’t the result we wanted, it was disappointing in that way but it was good to get back on the park again.“It was difficult conditions, absolutely roasting, playing against a good side but I felt there were times we played well and are starting to look like a good team.“They were a good side, the effort from the boys was there, we lost a few bad goals but, other than that, the boys worked hard.“We’re all gearing up for Saturday.“It was good to get back playing two 45 minute halves, a full 90 minutes as well. It’s a game we’re looking forward to.”Former Hearts goalie Hamilton has a rival for the gloves at Dens Park, with last season’s No 1 Parish having done well in the Dundee goal following the departure of Scott Bain.The 28-year-old has already issued a challenge to his new pal Hamilton ahead of the campaign that he’ll have a battle on his hands.It’s not one the new man is likely to shirk away from, however.He added: “I don’t think there’s anywhere there isn’t a battle for the gloves but it’s a fight I’m really up for and I want to be playing.“I got a good run at Hearts, 60-odd games but I’m here now to further that and I’m desperate to get more games and make myself better.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee martial arts club hoping to kick on with teles community chest cash","story":"\t\t\t\t\tYoungsters at Team Extreme Kickboxing Club are busy getting ready to take part in an international competition, and they are hoping our own contest helps get them there.The group has signed up to take part in the Tele’s Community Chest, and are trying to collect at least 50 tokens before Saturday July 28 to be in with a chance of winning a share of £10,000.The group has been running for almost eight years, and is a family-run martial arts club and fitness gym based in Charleston.Jimmy Cavanagh, chief instructor at the club, said: “It’s for kids from primary one right through to adults.“I saw the competition in the paper.

However, it wasn’t to be as while he rummaged in his bag to find the ring, he was interrupted by a group of German tourists.With the mood killed, they went to the beach, but after sunbathing for just 10 minutes, Craig said they should go back to the hotel because he was too hot.He chose the balcony of their room which overlooked the lake to ask Aimee to become his wife.Aimee couldn’t even answer and instead simply burst into tears of happiness.After careful planning by the couple, the morning of the wedding arrived and the sun was shining.Aimee said: “When I woke up and saw the sun I was so happy that I was getting my outdoor wedding.“It made the photos taken by Burfly Photography from the day look really green and beautiful.“We had a flower wall created by Celebre which was stunning and it would have been a beautiful backdrop for the ceremony too.”The bride was accompanied down the aisle by stepdad Graham and the ceremony conducted by humanist Neil Anderson was the highlight of the day.“We made sure that the ceremony wasn’t boring and it was very personal,” said Aimee.“Neil was absolutely incredible and delivered our story in a fun way.“The night-time reception was brilliant but the day-time was our highlight.”The pair took to the floor to have their first dance as a married couple to The Verve’s hit song Lucky Man, which was performed by band Paper Tiger.Craig and Aimee would like to thank their wedding planners Katy and Fiona, videographers I Do, bridal shop Annarose and all their family and friends.Aimee added: “I wouldn’t change a thing about my wedding.

It’s really quite surreal,” she said. “It’s such a big responsibility because it isn’t one of my own series but I’m happy with it because I write for me and I write what I think is enjoyable to read.”The Mystery of the Skull is set in the same time and world as the previous 15 Secret Seven novels, which are also being re-released.It sees the gang attempt to solve the mystery of a skull that appears from nowhere in Peter’s bedroom.More than 50 excited fans packed into the shop – some to see Pamela, others excited to pick up the Seven’s next adventure.Among them was Craigowl pupil Jessie Gray, 9, who got Pamela to sign both her copy of the novel and her handmade autograph book.She said: “I’ve got all of her books and I’ve read one of the Secret Seven ones.

But these days the high street is packed full of ’90s throwbacks.“Celebrating Shout’s 25th year has given us all the chance to take that, often cringe-worthy, walk down memory lane. But it turns out we were all style icons of our time. It’s been amazing to see all the trends and reminisce about the music we were listening to and the programmes we were watching.”So just what were we all wearing back in 1993?All Saints, the girl band who formed that very year and are making their comeback in 2018, managed to make combat trousers look edgy yet girly by pairing them with crop tops and halternecks.Grunge was all the rage with tartan shirts – often worn tied around the waist – loose fit, ripped mom jeans and lots and lots of black proving popular.Doc Marten boots worn with oversized jumpers, denim shorts and tights, indie bucket hats as made iconic by the likes of The Stone Roses and Oasis, and the rise of chunky trainers – including the rather fabulous Reeboks Pumps where you could actually increase the cushioning around your ankles by inflating them yourself were also on people’s shopping lists.Now in 2018, it’s tough being a teenage girl – navigating social media and the pressure of perfection that comes with it, thinking about the future, juggling school work and friendships.But Shout has embraced this new digital age.

I’m not surprised if some of the posties were a bit concerned because they’re pretty menacing creatures at the best of times.”Royal Mail said deliveries were still being carried out as normal in the area, despite the change in personnel.Royal Mail spokeswoman Sally Hopkins said: “The safety of our people is paramount to Royal Mail.“Our postmen and women can experience difficulties out on delivery in some areas due to swooping attacks by gulls.“These kinds of attacks can occur at this time of year as the gulls are nesting and rearing their chicks.“Fortunately we have not had any instances of gulls attacking our people in the Douglas area of Dundee and mail deliveries have been taking place as usual.“We are monitoring the situation to ensure we can continue to deliver safely to customers in the area.”Gulls have proved to be a menace for people throughout the city in recent years.The Tele reported on Tuesday that wheelchair-bound Kim Ferguson, 36, had a burger stolen by a bird when it landed on her arm.Last month, 73-year-old Christine Kerr was taken to hospital after being smacked on the head by a gull in the city centre.Meanwhile, signs emblazoned with the words “beware the gulls” have been placed on bins in the city in a bid to deter people from feeding the animals.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"project to convert 1970s double decker bus in to refuge for dundees needy","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCrafty Dundee folk have been urged to come forward and help transform a 1974 double-decker bus into a refuge for some of the city’s most vulnerable residents.St Luke’s pioneer minister Stuart Budden and the Rev Canon Kerry Dixon aim to use the old Daimler Fleetline to engage with some of the most isolated and lonely people living in Dundee.The pair are already well-known across the city for hosting weekly events offering food and friendship to people with difficult life circumstances, including the homeless and those with substance abuse issues.Captain Budden hopes to fit the vehicle with a working kitchen and seating area to help build long-lasting relationships with the city’s destitute through cooking, eating and meaningful conversations shared over teas and coffees.He said: “We would like the bus to be used by community groups, churches and schools for educational purposes, to gain new life skills and to be used to signpost people that use the bus to other support networks.“I have a total budget of just £4,000 to make this dream a reality.“I have never attempted anything like this before.

He has also raised concerns at Westminster about such firms on several occasions.He said: \"People should not be charged inflated fees when they have paid for parking in good faith.\"The British Parking Association confirmed to me in person it is their view that people should not be charged if they have made an error inputting their registration.\"This guidance must be heeded by parking operators and, where it is not, there needs to be greater enforcement.\"He added: \"It is high time that operators like Smart Parking were removed from our city centres once and for all.\"The MP was responding to the case of Roger High, from Nottinghamshire, who failed to persuade Smart Parking to overturn a charge issued to him and will now have to cough up \u0026pound100.He said: \"In my appeal I explained that I had transposed two of the letters [in my registration number] and the fact that the registration number was so similar to my postcode that it was easy to make such a small slip.\"I was appalled and livid to receive an email rejecting my appeal, even though they acknowledged that I had purchased a car parking ticket, on the grounds that I had not purchased it for the correct registration number.\"Visiting the area frequently to see family, Mr High insisted Smart Parking\u0027s actions \"would not change\" his love of this part of the world.However, he revealed the experience had left him \"miserable and depressed as well as outraged\".Highland Council trading standards officer William Paul, who has been involved in long-running discussions with Smart Parking, said he was surprised to hear about Mr High\u0027s problems, believing there had been positive changes at the site.It is understood ticket machine key pads have been made bigger to reduce the chance of errors and new software aims to eliminate charges being issued when easily detectable genuine mistakes are made.\"We are encouraged by recent improvements in the operating procedures of the car park and to be fair to the company, these improvements do seem to be making a difference,\" he said.\"We are assured that these improvements are based on a firm commitment to resolve the previous reported issues, including incorrect vehicle registration mark (VRM) entries.\"He encouraged any drivers affected by charge notices to follow Smart Parking\u0027s appeals system and, if necessary, report the matter via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 or at www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumerA spokesman for Smart Parking said: \"It is a contractual requirement for motorists to input their correct registration mark when parking at Strothers Lane Car park and failure to do so is a breach of the terms and conditions of parking there which can result in a Parking Charge Notice being issued.\"However Smart Parking acknowledges that motorists can make minor mistakes when entering their registration and as such working closely with Highland Trading Standards, has put in place measures to try to identify genuine mistakes against actual registration marks using the car park. Where the mistake is minor and the actual registration mark can be cross referenced Smart parking will endeavour to identify this and not issue the Parking Charge notice.\"Motorists are encouraged to double check their registration number before entering it and if those using the car park have entered a registration mark and subsequently received a Parking Charge Notice they are encouraged to engage with Smart Parking through our British Parking Association accredited appeals process.\"Friday 13 Jul 2018 10:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/03971000/03971780.jpg","title":"New air control system to be based at Inverness","story":"\u0026nbspThe board has also committed to undertaking a communities impact assessment as part of it Air Traffic Management 2030 project which will run all activities covering seven Scottish airports \u0026ndash Sumburgh, Dundee, Inverness, Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats, Kirkwall, Stornoway and Benbecula \u0026ndash from one centralised tower and surveillance centre.Hial managing director Inglis Lyon said: \"The scoping study identifies Inverness as having the most compelling case to support Hial\u0027 continued delivery of its core activities.\"We have also taken the views of our staff into account and Inverness was their preferred option should relocation be required.\"Inverness is best suited from a technical, operational and staffing perspective.

He didn’t attend the hearing at all.”Mr Adam said the fishermen faced a “bit of a dilemma” in removing their vehicles.He said: “We need to get some lifting equipment in there but he’s got all these boulders in place.“He doesn’t own all the land, there’s a narrow strip of land which he doesn’t own. There are boats there already but we can maybe squeeze a couple of boats there.”The sheriff has indicated the boulder obstructing the pier should be removed.However, Mr Kolhe is entitled to keep boulders or other obstructions along the verges of the private road to prevent cars parking on his land.Sheriff Miller’s judgment said it appears boats have been kept on the land by fishermen “extending throughout and beyond living memory” until the present day and had been “generally a matter of informal local practice”.A letter issued to the fishermen from the landowner in 2014 said he wished to improve the land for “amenity use”.Mr Kolhe could not be reached for comment.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/5b4840f1917e4-940x552.jpg ","title":"hotel bidding to use the hamilton school site for major expansion","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew plans have been lodged to extend an Aberdeen hotel by transforming a former private school.It was revealed in November last year that Graham and Gillian Wood, who own the Chester Hotel on Queen’s Road, had purchased the Hamilton School buildings, which have lain vacant for the past four years.The hotel has submitted an application to Aberdeen City Council to provide an additional 22 guest rooms on the site, in addition to its existing 50 bedrooms, and the hotel’s bar area will also double in size.At the time of buying the site, it had planning permission for an extension to provide 90 bedrooms in total but the new plans seek permission to build a smaller extension which the business believes to be more in keeping with the character of the Category B listed buildings.Stephen Gow, general manager at The Chester Hotel, said: “We’re seeking to replace what we considered to be a disproportionately sized extension for the footprint of the site with a minimal extension to the original building.“The plans are sympathetic to the stature and scale of buildings in Queen’s Road and will, with minimal intervention, knit the fabric of the existing Chester Hotel into the new properties.“We’re sympathetic to the architectural integrity of all of our Chester properties and have a track record of restoring listed buildings considerately, retaining their character and providing our guests, both here in Aberdeen and in Edinburgh, with a luxurious experience.“By removing some inappropriate building additions, which we believe are out of scale with the buildings at 55 – 57 Queen’s Road, we’ll hugely reduce what was the proposed developed area of the site.“Our new plans will remain sheltered in the existing footprint and will be in keeping with our West End location.“We have confidence in the market in Aberdeen and remain positive that our business will continue to grow.“This major investment cements our position as one of the city’s – and Scotland’s – leading independent hotels.”The owners previously said they were looking at a “number of options” for the West End site.The new plans will see the demolition of an existing large extension, which formerly housed the nursery of the Hamilton School, which will be replaced by a new addition with a footprint of 14m by 4m.This will form part of the new access link to the existing Chester Hotel and will also be used as part of an extended bar area.The design statement added: “This element will serve as part of a social hub for the new guest areas, and will use a similar architectural vocabulary to the formerly extended rear areas to the adjacent Chester Hotel – in particular The Granite Suite conference and wedding facility.“Smooth light-coloured render will be used for lower storey which shelters a small external terrace, with dark granite for the upper floor.“The part-glazed roof will admit light to the internal ‘terrace’ area.“This extension while deliberately modest in scale, will greatly improve the links between the existing villas and also provide a new sun-filled south-facing bar space.”Hamilton School was forced to shut its doors in 2014 when the Scottish Government and Care Inspectorate moved to shut it down amid safety concerns.In July last year Status Properties Limited submitted plans to convert the former B-listed school building into a hotel and restaurant complex, attracting objections from angry West End residents.The Queens Cross and Harlaw Community Council objected to the move, saying it would result in conflict with the amenity of the householders, but the application was later approved by councillors although not pursued.The hotel currently comprises a fine dining restaurant, lounge bar, spa and 50 bedrooms and the planned development would represent a significant expansion.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"one lane closed on busy aberdeen road for

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

Thanks also to everyone at MacPool, Argyll Cafe, Bargain Zone, Danny\u0026#8217s, Ferguson\u0026#8217s Butcher, The Archway, Crinan Cycles, Argyll Pharmacy, Square Peg, The Sweetie Jar, Dalriada Home Hardware, the Post Office and Maureen Roy for donating the great raffle prizes and Councillor Dougie Philand for being an excellent quiz master.And, of course, my appreciation to everyone who came along and took part.The event raised £120 which will help Lochgilphead Community Council put on this year\u0026#8217s festival on Saturday August 4 on Lochgilphead front green.Thank you everyone.Brian MacLennan, Lochgilphead Community Council.Sir,I have been working hard to address issues raised by my constituents. I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

On a lovely summer evening the rafters of Strachur Memorial Hall dirled to the sound of pipers showing off skills learned during the week in front of proud family members. John Kelly of Dunoon performed his master of ceremony duties with his usual wit and dexterity.An award, presented by his family in memory of the late Niall Campbell, is presented each year to the pupil who has shown the biggest improvement in the eyes of the tutors.

The biggest cheer of the day was reserved for this year’s Queen Chloe Macdonald, who together with her Princesses Caitlyn Prentice and Cara Mackie were introduced to the crowd by Rev Robert Macleod and Councillor Anne Horn.Tarbert’s new Royal Family then led the famous festival parade where locals and visitors alike dressed up and joined in with this year’s Heroes and Villains theme.  Pirates and superheroes watched on as Cruella De Vil and her dogcatcher tried to capture more Dalmatian puppies. And the Batmobile was hot on the trail of the Joker who was seen heading through the village with Poison Ivy.One of the festival’s most eagerly anticipated events is the cookery demonstrations, once again led by Mike Leslie of Kilsyth’s Coachman Hotel. The market area was packed as cooks got some professional tips on how to prepare and cook seafood.While the adults tucked into some of Tarbert’s finest fish and shellfish, younger festival-goers were being wowed by the gravity defying Clan Stunt Bike Team, before learning new skills in the circus workshop.Highland dancing displays plus performances by festival regulars Mid Argyll Pipe Band ensured there was something for everyone, before Sunday’s Beer on the Pier, where party people of all ages packed Tarbert’s quay, ready to be entertained.Girl band Feeva promised and delivered ‘cheesy tunes’ and were closely followed by Scotland’s number one Take That cover band, Could It Be Take That, to keep the party atmosphere going. Local band The Democrats brought the curtain down on this year’s festival in style.With just three people in the festival committee it fell to organiser Margaret MacNeill to comment on this year’s event saying: \u0026#8216Thank you to everyone who came and joined in with this year\u0026#8217s Seafood Festival. This weekend is about celebrating the heart of Tarbert and we’re delighted so many people came to join us.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12468674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_240218grant_07JPG.jpg","title":"maybole super school one step","story":"NewsMaybole super-school is one step closer to being builtCouncillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:27, 10 JUL 2018NewsNew Carrick Academy artist impression (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0026pound42million super-school has taken a step closer to being built in Maybole. Councillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy. Plans will see Cairn and Gardenrose Primaries merge to become a new school located at the purpose-built campus. Nurseries for both schools would also merge to be ready for August 2021. St Cuthbert’s Primary – where parents responding to the consultation issued a rejection of the move – would also relocate but operate as a stand-alone school. A bid for funding will now be made to the Scottish Government. A total of 87 written responses were received during the council’s consultation that officials noted was “low considering the size of Maybole with a population of 4,700 people”.  Council schools spokesman William Grant said: “There is a general agreement of all schools to come together. “Where we had a more mixed response regarded the possible move of the swimming pool. “It is important as we progress the design that too much is not crammed in to this new campus. “It must be open and spacious.” Maybole Tory councillor Ian Campbell hailed the project as a “wonderful step forward”.

Nicola, 28-year-old classical singer married 30-year-old shipbuilding engineer John Hunter. The pair now live in Shawlands, Glasgow, but were both originally from Ayr. One Friday night back in 2009 John walked in to Harley’s Pub in Ayr to wish his cousin a happy birthday, and his sister told him to say hello to Nicola – her workmate at the time. “Nobody knows if it was the brown eyes, the sweet perfume or the six pints, three vodkas and the shot of Midori that caused him to steal my cardigan but steal it he did,” joked Nicola. She added: “A few days later, cardigan in hand, John returned it to H Samuel where I worked at the time. And that moment was the beginning of something special.” Since then both have enjoyed years of happiness and in October 2016 – seven years after meeting – John asked Nicola to marry him at Loch Lomond.  John and Nicola tied the knot on Thursday, June 7, at The Cruin at Loch Lomond. The couple said: “It was relaxing, elegant and absolutely perfect. “We can’t thank the staff enough. The weather, setting and scenery were breath-taking.” The bride wore a Vera Wang dress from David’s Bridal, Braehead, the bridesmaids also wearing gowns from David’s Bridal. The kilts were the Spirit of Lochearn tartan from Kilts 4 U. The wedding party consisted of Best man Mark Cosgrove, Groomsmen Niall Carney, Paddy McCurdie and Ryan Glass (nephew, aged 8), Maid of honour sister Jennifer Cassells, Bridesmaids Laura Dickson, Heather Armstrong and Aimee Trainer, Groom’s parents John Hunter and Hazel Hunter and the Bride’s parents Brian Cassells and Julie Cassells. The pair are currently celebrating being newlyweds in Bangkok, Thailand, and will be heading to Koh Samui, Thailand, then on to the Atlantis in Dubai.  3D Cakes created the couples wedding cake. The couple said: “We were inspired by the Scottish theme and used the same tartan ribbon that was on the kilts.” Kev Moulds Photography captured Nicola and John’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to look back on. The bouquets were arranged by Narcissus Flowers by Susan Hair and make-up was styled and created by Anna Wade (hair) and Lynn Brown (make-up). The couple added: “We would like to thank everyone who made the day possible, especially our parents Brian Cassells, Julie Cassells, John Hunter and Hazel Hunter. “And to our guests who contributed to an amazing day.” For more photos of the couple\u0027s big day, pick up your copy of this week\u0027s Ayrshire Post.

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included. Agents Christie \u0026amp Co and Galbraith said the plot offered “potential for development under a new owner”. It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit.

Andrew Power, club captain of Royal Troon, said: “We chose to donate to the Acute Stroke Unit as three of our members were in this unit over the last year and are all now recovering well. The word from them is that they got the best of care and were delighted we chose to donate to the unit” During the event, Stroke and TIA (Transient Ischaemic Attack) information packs were handed out, making it a great opportunity to spread awareness of how to act when someone is suffering from a stroke.  Andrew added: “We had a great day, great weather and we were glad we made a good amount for a good cause. We’d like to say from all at Royal Troon that you (staff at Ward 3E) do a great job and hope this cheque can help out in any way it can”. Senior charge nurse, Christine Sommerville, said: “Patients are admitted from all over Ayrshire to the ASU. Stroke happens with no warning, but with specialised care and input, outcomes are improved. “We are delighted to hear the members are recovering well and that they had a positive experience in the ASU. “On behalf of the ASU team, a big thank you.

That’s the shock ultimatum delivered by warring SNP councillors to their embattled leader. Douglas Campbell has been ordered to regain control of his split ranks during the council’s summer break. It comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track. A racism storm and failed coup on Councillor Campbell has plunged the SNP into crisis. And the Post understands another plot to oust the leader is now brewing. It follows all SNP group members signing a declaration of support for their under-fire boss just two weeks ago. But a party insider has revealed growing disquiet is threatening to tear the group apart.  Within hours of the public show of support, Cllr Campbell was being placed under increasing pressure to step down of his own accord, rather than face another bruising challenge from within, the Post has learned. A senior source said: “People agreed to fall in line and sign the declaration for the sake of the bigger picture. “But it’s widely accepted that a change is required and this can’t go on. “The group is in a position where people will fight like rats to get what they want. “However, the even bigger concern is trying to keep the administration intact.” Worries over a potential walkout from Labour colleagues has, until now, ensured enough SNP support behind Cllr Campbell. A potential change in the their leadership is thought that have strained relations with administration partners, who have indicated they are happier working with Cllr Campbell.  But the Post understands that Cllr Campbell’s Labour past is forming a big part of the problem for the SNP leader as he battles factions within his new party. And a new warning – issued as councillors left for their summer break – stressed that he must crack the whip among his troubled ranks. The source added: “It was made very clear that if he doesn’t, the matter will be taken out of his hands. “The party is being crucified every week and it cannot be allowed to continue. “Some see Douglas as being far too close to Labour and that is undoubtedly a big issue for him. “Either way, he’s been given the message in clear terms that he needs to get everyone behind him and on the same page.” When asked about the warning, the group’s depute leader, William Grant, insisted: “This is news to me.” Cllr Campbell added: “Cllr Grant responded to your enquiry that ‘This is news to me’ and I have nothing to add.” "},{"url":null,"title":"pool-at-hawicks-teviotdale-leisure-centre-to-reopen-after-co2-delivery","story":"HAWICK swimming pool will reopen later this afternoon (Thursday, July 5) following a delivery of CO2.\nA shortage of the gas, which is used to control PH levels of the water, forced Live Borders to close the facility at Teviotdale Leisure Centre this morning.\nBut, since the delivery, it is planned to open at 3.45pm this afternoon to cater for lessons.\nLive Borders are confident other pools won\u0027t have to close if scheduled deliveries of CO2 are made over the next week or so.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"travel-a68-cleared-after-lorry-sheds-load-of-hay-on-road","story":"THE A68 has reopened to traffic after a lorry shed a load of hay on the road this afternoon.\nThe accident covered\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspA68 in both directions at the A697, near Carfraemill at around 1.10pm.\nA cleanup operation swiftly launched to remove the hay from the road.\nTraffic Scotland\u0026nbspconfirmed at\u0026nbsp3.10pm today (Thursday, July 5) that the hay has since\u0026nbspbeen cleared off the carriageway.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch-see-inside-abandoned-galashiels-church","story":"A YOUTUBE video highlighting safety fears over an abandoned historic church in Galashiels is creating an online storm.\nThe video, filmed within the last fortnight, shows Galashiels resident Ian Macey jumping onto a flat roof and entering the 138-year-old St Aidan\u0026rsquos Church in Gala Park Road through an open window.\nIan highlights a lack of security at the building \u0026ndash which contains precious war memorials \u0026ndash vandalism, rotting floorboards and exposes its hidden health hazards such as asbestos.\nThe scenes have drawn criticism from some of the hundreds who have viewed the footage.\nIan told the \nBorder \n: \u0026ldquoThis is the second time I\u0026rsquove had a look around the church, after entering it earlier in the year.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre.

Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

They were sitting lined up in their cars looking to see what was going on.  \u0026ldquoI have sat outside with my breakfast some mornings and have had to lift my bowl of cereal and walk back in the house.  Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p. We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.  Another resident, who declined to be named agreed, saying: \u0026ldquoWe are getting no privacy and I can\u0026rsquot even sit out in the back garden for people looking in.  Alan Glasgow, Dunedin Canmore housing director, said: \u0026ldquoWe are aware there are a small number of residents at Eskmills Road who have concerns about the garden fence.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to work with the community and local partners to see what can be done to help further increase privacy when people are using the nearby car park.

Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7991066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"vandals-force-nursery-to-end-term-early","story":"  Staff at Pinkie St Peter\u0027s nursery, in Musselburgh, said the damage had been extensive and the building would have to undergo a deep clean to ensure all the glass was cleared from it before any of its youngsters could be allowed back in.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.

The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.  Mrs Paul said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had bottles thrown into the garden \u0026ndash they are loud and they get up to all sorts. It\u0026rsquos been going on five or six years.

Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.

Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.

Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.

The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park. That would require special funding applications.  Stuart Gibb, area manager of Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership (DELAP), said that consultation had already taken place with groups such as DELAP and the town\u0026rsquos community council, as well as various departments of East Lothian Council.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe area partnership is supporting the acknowledgement that the town is getting bigger.  \u0026ldquoFacilities and amenities need to be on the ball in terms of that growth to ensure that we have suitable and sustainable facilities moving forward."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8055467.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scottish-open-the-renaissance-club-to-stage-2019-tournament","story":"  This year\u0027s tournament is due to get under way tomorrow (Thursday) at Gullane Golf Club and, in 12 months\u0027 time,\u0026nbspwill move just three miles along the coast as it is played at the Renaissance Club, at Archerfield.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064714.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  He and fellow countryman\u0026nbspLee Westwood had both joined overnight leader Luke List at the top of the leaderboard, but Hatton\u0027s good form has continued and he is now one stroke clear of the chasing pack, on nine-under-par.

The remaining nine per cent were don\u0026rsquot knows.  The findings increase the pressure on Ms Sturgeon as she considers her next move in the escalating constitutional fight with Westminster over Brexit.  The First Minister called a second referendum in March 2017, then \u0026ldquoreset her plan three months later after the SNP lost a third of its MPs in the general election.  She had promised to update MSPs on a \u0026ldquoprecise timescale on a second referendum this autumn, once the shape of the final Brexit deals becomes clear.  Earlier this week, her Brexit Secretary Michael Russell suggested a second EU referendum could double as an independence vote if the 2016 result was repeated and Scotland backed Remain and the UK voted Leave.  There is fight between the UK and Scottish governments at the Supreme Court between now and the autumn, which could end in Westminster trampling over Holyrood\u0026rsquos alternative Brexit Bill, a huge moment the SNP would add to their case for independence.  But the lack of popular support for a second plebiscite will be a concern for the First Minister.  Nevertheless, the poll also found support for independence slightly higher than in the 55-45 No vote of 2014, with 53 per cent opposed and 47 per cent in favour, excluding don\u0026rsquot knows.  The Scottish Parliament voted last year in favour of Westminster transferring the power to hold a referendum, but the request for a \u0027Section 30 order\u0027 was rebuffed by Theresa May.  If Ms Sturgeon pushed again for a referendum, the Prime Minister would almost certainly refuse again, but the SNP could cite the snub in the 2021 Holyrood election as evidence of Westminster arrogance, as they try to win a clear-cut mandate for a new vote.  Professor Sir John Curtice of Strathclyde University said the poll showed that, despite SNP hopes of a shift in opinion, Brexit was still having little impact on the independence question.  He said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the SNP have had somewhat the better of the argument in the row about the impact of Brexit Withdrawal Bill on the powers of the Scottish Parliament, there\u0026rsquos still no sign of any significant change in the level for support for independence \u0026ndash or much evidence of enthusiasm for an early ballot among the party\u0026rsquos supporters.  The Unionist parties said Ms Sturgeon should drop an idea the public didn\u0026rsquot clearly want.  Scottish Labour Leader Richard Leonard said: \"The people of Scotland want the government focused on jobs, schools and hospitals, not another referendum campaign that creates false divisions between working class people when the real divide is between the richest and the rest of us.  \"The chaos at the heart of the Tory government has focused people\u0026rsquos minds on the extreme challenges of leaving a political and economic union, and it is clear that there is not strong support for Nicola Sturgeon to try and force another referendum onto the agenda.\"  A Scottish Tory spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThis poll again shows the majority of people do not want a second referendum - and they overwhelmingly don\u0026rsquot want one any time soon.  \u0026ldquoNicola Sturgeon should use this research as motivation to take the threat of another divisive vote off the table.  The SNP highlighted the narrowing between the Yes and No sides on independence compared to 2014.  MSP Derek Mackay, the party\u0026rsquos business convener, said support for independence remained at historically high levels, \"with a Yes majority within the margin of error and well within touching distance\".  Dropping a hint that Ms Sturgeon was minded to push for a second vote, he said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore not - yet - in the heat of an independence campaign.  \u0026ldquoBut as Westminster moves from chaos to utter shambles, proving beyond doubt it is incapable of protecting our interests, the case for independence becomes ever stronger.  \u0026ldquoLittle wonder that since last year there has been a marked rise in the number of people who back giving the people of Scotland that choice over their future.  \u0026ldquoWith the full powers of independence we could make better choices in Scotland\u0026rsquos interests and avoid the damage of a Tory Brexit.  Scottish Green MSP Patrick Harvie added:\u0026nbsp\"It\u0026rsquos remarkable that support for independence remains so high given that the Yes movement hasn\u0026rsquot done a single bit of formal campaigning.  \"The status quo will no longer exist in March 2019 and I suspect that voters in Scotland will come to demand a say on whether we should be dragged along with this Brexit mess.\"  Survation interviewed 1002 Scots online between July 5 and 10."},{"url":null,"title":"sketch-new-boy-raab-caught-with-his-trousers-down-metaphorically","story":"  The well-scrubbed minister rose to deliver his first Commons dispatch box speech in a calm and considered manner when, after a minute or so, the chamber descended into uproar.  The only thing missing in this Whitehall farce was an MP in his pyjamas chasing a semi-naked woman through the chamber.  Labour MPs stood up, sat down and stood up again, pointing this way and that to complain they had not yet seen sight of the Government\u0026rsquos two-years-in-the-making White Paper on Brexit. Julian Smith, the wide-eyed Government Chief Whip, started mumbling in colleagues\u0026rsquo ears as a ripple of concern spread along the front bench.  The words \u0026ldquodisgrace and \u0026ldquoshame bounced around the chamber. Comrades Ben Bradshaw and Angela Eagle were looking up at the press gallery, gesticulating to members of the fourth estate to helpfully lob down their copies.  MPs\u0026rsquo indignation had been increased because HM Press had preferentially been given sight of the controversial document hours before MPs had.  As the tumult rose, so did the Speaker, crying: \u0026ldquoOrder. Order.  Referring to MPs\u0026rsquo \u0026ldquoconsiderable unhappiness, John Bercow, in his usual non-patronising way, asked if the minister would rather stop so MPs could get sight of the missing document. Mr R caused more uproar when he suggested it was on its way.  When the Speaker pointed out how some copies had been made available to \u0026ldquosome people, MPs began pointing furiously at the hacks up in the gallery.  Mr Bercow repeated his nudge-nudge, wink-wink suggestion to the minister but the penny still did not drop. MPs anger intensified when Mr R nonchalantly noted how the paper was available on the Government website.  Seething Labour MPs started to walk out while others began shouting \u0026ldquoPoint of Order, at which the Speaker finally gave in and suspended the sitting until MPs could get a copy of the document they were supposed to be debating.

Now the photographic archive of Mrs Fay Shaw\u0026rsquos collection of more than 9,000 negatives has been digitally remastered and chronicled or the first time and brings to life a long lost way of life for islanders.  The internationally important archive was shot entirely by her as she travelled across the islands.  Unlike most documentaries which are taken over a relatively short period of time, the Fay Shaw collection was created over more than 70 years and captures a way of life that has virtually disappeared.    The MacRae sisters\u0026nbsp  It starts in 1929, when Margaret left her home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and moved to Lochboisdale on South Uist and lived with the Campbell family.  The opportunity to immerse herself more fully in Gaelic culture came one night after dinner at Boisdale House.  Her host, Donald Ferguson, encouraged his cousins M\u0026agraveiri and P\u0026egraveigi Anndra (M\u0026agraveiri and P\u0026egraveigi MacRae) \u0026ndash two sisters who worked at the house \u0026ndash to sing for the guests after the meal.  To Margaret \u0026lsquotheir songs were golden\u0026rsquo and asked the sisters if they would teach her their songs.  A week later she travelled to their small blackhouse in the village of North Glendale and the MacRae sisters agreed to take her in as a lodger.  She would live with them for the next six years and never again returned to the United States full-time.  Now her fascinating journey is being digitised by the National Trust for Scotland through funding by the Morton Charitable Trust.  Lily Barnes is the documentation officer carrying out the work and has being embarking on detective work to track down who and what is in all of the 9,000 images which are not captioned.    A South Uist islander  She said: \"It is a really strange experience looking at people and a lifestyle that no longer exists and bring them into the modern day.  \"This is a unique and extremely important collection as it is people going about their daily business, taken by one of their own who is living within them as part of their community.  \"I then get to spend time exploring the images themselves, identifying people, places and activities, and writing their descriptions for our digital catalogue, so that they can be discovered by future users.  \"I have also listened to the Gaelic tapes which were also recorded and through these I can place certain people in places at a given time even if they have their back to the camera. It is a fascination insight into what life was like almost 100 years ago\".  Rheumatism in her finger joints made sustained piano playing impossible, but Margaret felt that she could still serve music by collecting Gaelic songs, scrupulously, at source.

He had gone to Barra to learn colloquial Gaelic and record local singers and he and Margaret were married in Glasgow in 1935 and settled on Barra.  In 1938, she and John moved to the Isle of Canna after he bought it and it is here she would live for the rest of her life.  He divided his day between cultivating the land, and transcribing the hundreds of Gaelic songs and stories he had recorded on Barra, South Uist and in Nova Scotia.  Margaret accompanied him and recorded it all for posterity by taking photographs and cine films to capture every moment that he met and recorded Gaelic communities.    American heiress Magret Fay Shaw outside the MacRae sisters house  One of the films is of Margaret returning to Glendale in 1955, bearing as a gift for the MacRae sisters her newly published Folksongs and Folklore of South Uist, which she had collected and would not have been possible without the encouragement and knowledge of the sisters.  But while some of the cine films have been seen and some of the pictures published, this is the first time the entire collection will be chronicled, labelled and produced in chronological order from 1929 to her death in 1996.  The National Trust for Scotland intend to make it available online for future generations to enjoy.

Everyone knew what needed to be done and all mucked in, no questions asked.  \"But they also capture how everyone had an individual role too and listening to the Gaelic tapes provides a fascinating soundtrack. There are songs to collect the kelp to, shear the sheep and to cut the peat, each with their own sounds and tempo.  \"This is a truly unique archive and chronicles a unique way of life.

But it comes after Comcast increased its offer for Sky to  \u0026pound26 billion, just hours after Fox raised its bid to \u0026pound24.5 billion.  All eyes will now turn to Fox to see if it will increase its offer for the 61 per cent of Sky it does not already own.  In a written statement, Mr Wright said: \u0026ldquoThe publication of the undertakings marks the final stage of the public interest consideration of this case.  \u0026ldquoIt is now a matter for the Sky shareholders to decide whether to accept 21st Century Fox\u0026rsquos bid.  Mr Wright only took over as Culture Secretary on Tuesday after the latest Cabinet reshuffle, replacing Matt Hancock, who became Health Secretary.  He said amended guarantees had been made over Sky News to address concerns over media plurality, as well as changes to the associated brand licensing agreement following responses to the Government\u0026rsquos consultation.  Under its plans to appease Government concerns, Fox has pledged to offload Sky News to Walt Disney, which is separately bidding to buy a major chunk of Fox assets, including the Sky stake.  Fox has also vowed to provide a Disney-owned Sky News channel with funding of at least \u0026pound100 million a year for 15 years.  The Government had been concerned over the impact that Fox\u0026rsquos takeover of Sky could have on UK media, given that the Murdoch family also owns News Corp - the publisher of a raft of newspapers including The Sun and The Times.  Mr Hancock had told Parliament that if terms of a sale of Sky News could not be agreed, the \u0026ldquoonly  effective remedy now would be to block the merger altogether.  Sky\u0026rsquos shares were trading 3% higher as investors were betting on a higher bid from Fox to see off Comcast.  Comcast turned up the heat overnight with a new \u0026pound14.75-a-share proposal, up from \u0026pound12.50 previously.  It came after Fox raised its bid to \u0026pound14 a share on Wednesday from the \u0026pound10.75 a share offered when it first made a bid for Sky 18 months ago.

The firm wanted judges Lord Carloway, Lord Menzies and Lord Malcolm to block moves to publish paperwork, saying the information contained was \u0026ldquocommercially sensitive and could help competitors.  Lord Tyre refused to allow the company permission to stop the inquiry publishing the documents, which includes monthly reports made during the tram project to the firm\u0026rsquos German HQ.  Lawyers acting for the company argued Lord Tyre had incorrectly nterpreted the law.  But in a judgment published yesterday, the appeal judges ruled Lord Tyre had acted correctly.  In a ruling written by Lord Carloway, Scotland\u0026rsquos most senior judge, the appeal judges concluded the documents didn\u0026rsquot contain sensitive information that could damage the business\u0026rsquos interests.  Lord Carloway wrote: \u0026ldquoThe Lord Ordinary had some sympathy for the view that the respondent\u0026rsquos reference to the information being available to individuals who were no longer employed by the petitioner\u0026rsquos group, was an irrelevant consideration\u0026nbspgiven that such employees\u0026nbspwould be the subject of contractual restraints.  \u0026ldquoHe held, however, it was not a material one. Whilst the court agrees with that reasoning, in fact the respondent was correct in its view, that the information would be available to those no longer employed by the petitioner\u0026rsquos group.  \u0026ldquoIt is not an unreasonable assumption that there will be many former group employees who will have been involved in many projects involving similar information and reports, who have moved on to work for other concerns.  \u0026ldquoWhatever the contractual restraints, historical information on the petitioner\u0026rsquos working estimates and margins of the type under consideration would likely to be held by many working elsewhere in the civil engineering field.  The Edinburgh trams project, which caused massive disruption to the capital, was delivered years late and more than \u0026pound400 million over budget.  The inquiry into what went\u0026nbspwrong has run for three years and cost \u0026pound7 million.  Bilfinger handed over the documents to the inquiry. But it didn\u0026rsquot want the documents to be made public.  The inquiry\u0026rsquos chairman Lord Hardie decided to publish the material because he thought it was in the public interest for it to be made available.  He ruled that Bilfinger hadn\u0026rsquot shown exactly why the information contained within the documents was commercially sensitive.  This prompted Bilfinger to go to the Court of Session. Lord Tyre concluded that the inquiry acted correctly.  The firm then appealed to the Inner House of the Court of Session. But their bid there has also been rejected.

Also, the Government\u0026rsquos proposed customs solution \u0026ndash the facilitated customs arrangement - will have a \"phased\" implementation Whitehall sources have suggested this will not be completed until mid-2022, two years after the end of the transition period.  Jacob Rees-Mogg, who leads the 60-strong group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, unleashed a fierce attack on the Government paper, saying: \"The overall consequence is that we will be a rule-taker, de-facto subject to the European Court of Justice and it\u0027s hard to believe that there is even a tinge of pink left in Mrs May\u0027s red line on this.  Suggesting the PM had broken her promises given in her earlier keynote speeches, he declared: \u0026ldquoWe have not known such vassalage to the continent since King John paid homage to the King of France in 1200.  The Somerset MP insisted his party leader\u0026rsquos policy on immigration meant nothing as it kept open the \u0026ldquooption of free movement by another name and added: \u0026ldquoThis White Paper has not needed age to turn yellow.  In a Commons statement, Dominic Raab, the new Brexit Secretary, said the paper set out a vision for \"a bold, ambitious and innovative new partnership with the EU, principled and practical, faithful to the referendum it delivers a deal that is good for the UK and good for our EU friends.  The Government, he explained, wanted to maintain parts of a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook for goods to maintain \"frictionless trade at the border\" after Brexit and so avoid a hard Irish border.  While the European Court will shape the trade rules, Mr Raab sought to reassure MPs, saying control of laws would be taken back by means of a \u0026ldquoparliamentary lock on the process and that MPs would have \u0026ldquoproper democratic oversight.  A new governing body would police the new institutional arrangements through which, the paper said, the UK Government \"will represent the interests of all parts of the UK in this forum, ensuring the interests of the devolved administrations are taken into account.  But Fiona Hyslop for the Scottish Government said the paper offered \u0026ldquolittle reassurance for those worried about the impact that leaving the EU will have on our economy quite simply, these plans fall short and will harm our economy.  The SNP administration\u0026rsquos External Affairs Secretary said it would \u0026ldquoargue for much greater engagement with the UK Government to ensure Scotland\u0027s interests are protected\".  In the Commons chamber, Mr Raab\u0026rsquos first appearance at the dispatch box in his new role descended into chaotic scenes as Labour MPs erupted in uproar, shouting \u0026ldquodisgrace, because they had not had prior sight of the paper when the Secretary of State rose to his feet.  To make the MPs\u0026rsquo sense of outrage worse, it was pointed out how journalists had been briefed by Whitehall officials and had had sight of the policy document before parliamentarians got to see it.  Such was the tumult on the green benches that John Bercow, the Speaker, had to suspend the sitting until MPs were able to get copies, which were handed out by their colleagues from boxes obtained from Westminster officials.  Labour\u0026rsquos Sir Keir Starmer, denounced the Government\u0026rsquos handling of the launch, telling MPs: \"The utter shambles of the last 20 minutes that led to the suspension of the House during a statement is clear evidence of why the Government is in such a mess.\"  The SNP\u0026rsquos Pete Wishart said the incident summed up the \u0026ldquowhole chaotic and clueless Brexit as prosecuted by this shambles of a Government.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe White Paper was supposed to deliver Cabinet unity, but all it has done, as we have seen, is demonstrate the divisions. Scotland did not vote for any of this, so can the Secretary of State perhaps suggest a way that Scotland might be spared this madness?  Mr Raab, to Conservative cheers, replied: \u0026ldquoWe voted in the referendum as one country and we need to respect it as one country.  Earlier, Donald Trump, who is in Britain for, among other things, a working lunch with Mrs May, when they will discuss Brexit, appeared to question the PM\u0026rsquos Brexit strategy.  He told reporters \"I would say Brexit is Brexit. The people voted to break it up so I would imagine that\u0027s what they would do but maybe they\u0027re taking a different route.

The plan, which also advocates more cycle and walking networks and helping children play outside safely, aims to cut physical inactivity in adults and teenagers by 15 per cent by 2030.  This equates to around 250,000 people becoming more active through sports, walking, cycling and informal physical activity such as gardening.  Other steps include more community sports hubs in the most deprived areas, more sport for pupils before and after school, doubling the budget for cycle and walking infrastructure to \u0026pound80m a year, and encouraging more women and girls to participate in physical activity.  The government also recommends getting rid of the warning notice beloved of park-keepers and council jobsworths down the ages.  \u0026ldquoWe will promote a supportive approach to physical activity, play and sport in public spaces, and encourage removal of signs which discourage this, e.g. \u0026lsquono ball games\u0026rsquo signs, it said.  Only eight per cent of Scots play football at least once a month.  Launching the plan at an Edinburgh school that is also a community sports hub, Mr Fitzpatrick said: \u0026ldquoBeing physically active is one of the best things we can do for our physical and mental health. It can also transform communities by helping people connect and come together in shared activities.  \u0026ldquoCutting the level of physical inactivity by 15 per cent by 2030 means addressing all of the factors involved. This includes relatively large action such as investing in our active travel infrastructure so people can easily walk and cycle, and supporting initiatives such as Health Walks for those who need help to become active, to small acts such as encouraging removal of \u0026lsquoNo Ball Games\u0026rsquo signs.  Professor Fiona Bull from the World Health Organisation said: \"Regular physical activity is one of the best things you can do for your health. It can contribute to a healthier and more sustainable future for our children.  Tory MSP Brian Whittle said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad the Scottish Government has adopted my idea of removing \u0026lsquono ball games\u0026rsquo signs. That will help create more open spaces, and just allow children to play again without fear of being told otherwise by authorities.  \u0026ldquoBut this in itself will not be enough. The SNP is far too piecemeal in its approach \u0026ndash ideas on physical activity need to be done in tandem with diet and education.  LibDem MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton said a \u0026ldquonational falls strategy was also needed, to persuade the elderly that walking activities would be safe.  He said: \u0026ldquoFear of falling vastly reduces the orbit of your social universe and for many older people having no confidence in the safety of pavements and footpaths can lead to the double whammy of isolation and inactivity.  Green MSP Alison Johnstone said an Active Nation Commissioner was needed to help fix \u0026ldquodecades of underinvestment in our walking and cycling routes.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need urgent, stronger action if we really want to get people active, and address health conditions like obesity and diabetes.  \u0026ldquoWe clearly need better opportunities for young people to take part in sport in school, all too often pupils have a very limited choice of sports and activities."},{"url":null,"title":"pilots-strike-achieved-nothing-says-ryanair","story":"  The comments came after a number of the company\u0026rsquos pilots took part in a 24-hour strike over their conditions of employment.

The Club argues that reducing the rate will remove a destructive disincentive for owners to improve their homes and to apply for listed building consent. This disincentive was introduced when the Government removed the zero rate of VAT for pre-authorised alterations to listed buildings in 2012.  The Club is mobilising the UK\u0026rsquos 1.5 million listed property owners to press the case for change. If the petition achieves 10,000 signatures, the Government will have to respond. If more than 100,000 sign, the issue could be debated in Parliament. The petition has been launched and can be viewed at www.lpoc/vatpetition  Martin Anslow of The Listed Property Owners\u0026rsquo Club said: \u0026ldquoIn 2012 the Government dealt a huge blow to listed property owners \u0026ndash most of whom are very far from being the wealthy home owners they are perceived to be.  \u0026ldquoRemoving the zero rate has been a significant double whammy. Since 2012 there has been a noticeable decline in the number of applications for listed building consent.  \u0026ldquoOwners either cannot afford to carry out vital repairs leading to more crumbling buildings and greater risks to safety, particularly as owners put off expensive re-wiring projects and other renovations, or they are carrying out alterations without consent.  \u0026ldquoWe speak to many owners each day and it is very clear that they no longer have an incentive to seek formal listed building consent for interior or out-of-sight changes. This not only poses a risk to our built heritage, it is helping to stagnate the market for listed properties. Many owners tell us they cannot sell their homes because potential buyers are put off by the costs or because previous owners have made alterations without consent.  The Club argues that providing VAT support to listed property owners would be a modest cost to the Treasury but would reap benefits to the economy.  \u0026ldquoA report by Experian in 2015 made the case that a reduction in the rate of VAT on housing renovation and repair would have a stimulus effect on the economy of more than \u0026pound15.1billion between 2015 and 2020, and would create an extra 42,050 construction jobs by the end of 2020, said Mr Anslow.  \u0026ldquoThe Club believes there would be a significant benefit to the economy even if the VAT reduction were limited to listed properties. In our survey, 91% of owners said that if VAT was reduced to 5% for repairs and approved alterations they would be more likely to undertake work, even if it meant formally applying for listed building consent. It seems only fair to reduce the VAT when building new homes is zero rated.  \u0026ldquoWe know there is pressure for change \u0026ndash just recently shadow Scottish Minister Paul Sweeney called for the restoration of VAT relief to protect listed properties after two fires in just three months destroyed three listed buildings in Glasgow.  \u0026ldquoThe Club intends to keep up the pressure until the November Budget. This petition is an opportunity to say to Ministers that the voices of 1.5 million listed property owners can no longer be ignored. It\u0026rsquos a chance to say to MPs that they should take our views seriously because the votes of listed property owners may make a difference at the next election.  Craig Mackinlay, Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Listed Properties, said: \"Reducing VAT on alterations to listed properties from the standard rate of 20% to 5%, or even zero post-Brexit once the ability to set our own sales tax rules return to our Parliament, would signal a clear indication from the Government that they are listening to those who are at the front line of maintaining our nation\u0026rsquos historic buildings.  \u0026ldquoAs 98% of listed buildings in the UK are privately owned, I cannot stress enough how much of a positive impact this reduction on VAT would provide to owners who are already struggling with complicated planning guidelines and high costs.\""},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-which-previous-presidents-have-met-the-queen","story":"              Donald Trump will be the 12th US president to meet the Queen when the pair have tea at Windsor Castle later on Friday."},{"url":null,"title":"airport workers vote for strike action over pay","story":"        Workers at Aberdeen International Airport have voted for strike action after 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.

Blair Nimmo commented: “Deveron Homes and Deveron Construction are well-known businesses in the North East and provide a significant source of employment in Huntly through the construction supply chain. Disappointingly, market conditions and contract delays have required both businesses to cease trading. \"We will do everything we can to seek a buyer who may be able to protect the businesses and maximise recoveries for creditors.“The firms have an integrated infrastructure together with a property portfolio and various ongoing contracts. We would encourage any party who has an interest in acquiring both the businesses and assets to contact us as soon as possible.“We will be working with employees and relevant government agencies to ensure the full range of support is available to all those affected.”                                                                                                        Anyone with an interest in buying the assets of the company should contact Geoff Jacobs on 01224 591000 or write to KPMG LLP, 37 Albyn Place, Aberdeen, AB10 1JB.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Friday 13 Jul 2018 10:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116574.jpg","title":"High calibre medical staff recruited in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbspNHS Highland yesterday confirmed the full and part-time appointments, which include two advanced nurse practitioners and a physiotherapist.Bill Fernie, chairman of Caithness Health Action Team, said: \u0026ldquoIt is definitely good news that the posts which were empty for a long time are being filled and that is welcomed by us.\u0026ldquoThis is a success for NHS Highland but it has been a long time coming. They still have some way to go with other vacant posts but it is good to see GPs being recruited.\u0026ldquoHaving locums all the time means patients don\u0026rsquot see the same person, but with GPs you have a better chance of continuity.Dr David Carson and Dr Mike Ruse are set to join advanced nurse practitioner (ANP) Colin Armer \u0026ndash a recent recruit \u0026ndash at the Riverbank Medical Practice in Thurso.Dr Herjit Sutherland is to join the Riverview Medical Practice in Wick along with new ANP appointment Vicki Kelly.Mike Flavell, who is giving up his post as NHS Highland\u0026rsquos Caithness district manager, is an advanced physiotherapist and is to begin weekly clinics shortly in the Riverbank and Riverview practices as well as in the Lybster medical practice. He will leave his present post in September, although he will be replaced.Mr Flavell thinks his clinics will provide a number of benefits for patients and practices alike.He said: \u0026ldquoTwenty-five per cent of appointments at GP practices are for muscular skeletal problems. So, in theory, my physiotherapy clinics could help to take 25 per cent off the GP\u0026rsquos workload.\u0026ldquoAnd for people aged over 75, that figure goes up to 38 per cent, so I may be able to provide even more support.Kath Jones, NHS Highland\u0026rsquos associate medical director north and west, said: \u0026ldquoThree Caithness GP practices run by NHS Highland have recently attracted six new clinicians to permanent posts including three GPs, two ANPs and a physio practitioner.\u0026ldquoThe appointment of so many high-calibre clinicians within such a short time is a credit to the quality of the teams working in these practices. The recruitment of three GPs is particularly remarkable considering a quarter of GP practices across Scotland have vacancies.\u0026ldquoThe recruitment of all the clinicians will improve the continuity of care provided by the practices while introducing access to a specialist primary care physio at the three sites.\u0026ldquoReducing the reliance on temporary locums will enable NHS Highland to save money while improving care. With two of the clinicians moving into the district to take up post, this will be good for the local economy too.Mr Armer has already taken up his post at the practice on Janet Street, Thurso.

He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Friday 13 Jul 2018 10:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Subsea 7 order hailed as very good news for Caithness","story":"A MULTIMILLION-pound order that has been won by Subsea 7 and will create up to 130 jobs was described yesterday as \u0026ldquovery good news for Caithness.The company has been awarded a contract by Shell for a development at its Penguins field which lies 150 miles north east of Shetland.Subsea 7, which has yards at Wester and Hastigrow, will build two pipeline bundles in Caithness as part of the deal.

I found countless deserted and remote beaches piled high with it \u0026ndash plastic bottles, cotton-bud sticks, fishing gear, plastic bags, she said.\u0026ldquoThe worst-affected beaches in Scotland were on the west coast.

Pupils at Wick High could also miss out on extracurricular activities, it was stated.At present, Stagecoach runs a service to Gills Bay three times a day, Monday to Saturday, but from next month it will operate twice a day, Monday to Friday. There are additional journeys between Wick and John O\u0026rsquoGroats but they vary according to school hours.A Stagecoach spokeswoman said the company recognised the feedback from the community over its plans. \u0026ldquoThe revised proposals represent a significant investment by Stagecoach, and work will continue to promote these links to encourage a sustainable level of demand. A review will take place 12 months after the start of the new timetable in order to establish the long term future of the bus service to Gills Bay.Trudy Morris, who chairs the Caithness Transport Forum, said: \u0026ldquoWe are very pleased to see that Stagecoach has listened to the local community and agreed to secure the bus link to Gills Bay for a further 12 months. Not only will this bring benefit to local bus users, who would otherwise be isolated in their communities, but it also has potential to benefit the tourist market, providing services to link with the Gills Bay ferry.However, she is concerned about the review in 12 months time and said: \u0026ldquoWe will be working with Stagecoach and the local community to see what can be done to promote usage of the route, and will also be discussing with public sector partners such as Highland Council to see what might be done to secure the route on a non-commercial basis in future.Bill Mowat, the chairman of Gills Harbour Ltd, claimed public pressure had an impact on Stagecoach and pointed out there was strong opposition to the plan.Friday 13 Jul 2018 10:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 12, 2018 at 4:28 pmNo roads surface dressing work is planned for Friday or Monday, July 13 and 16.

Last November, Loganair flew Teddy over 200 miles back to Kirkwall for a tearful homecoming with his young owner.Officially launched to mark Teddy Bear Picnic Day, this Tuesday, July 10, the furry keepsakes come with their very own Loganbear luggage tags as well as outfits mirroring the tartan look and feel of the airline’s own uniforms. Throughout the summer months, children will be able to pick between a Logie or Lotti bear once they come onboard a Loganair aircraft, distributed by the airline’s flight crew.The airline is running a number of social media competitions and promotional activity featuring the bears throughout July and August and will also be launching its Instagram channel to showcase the two toys.Kay Ryan, Commercial Director at Loganair said: “We’re very much looking forward to giving some of our youngest passengers a special memory of their trip with Loganair and what better day to unveil the two newest members of our crew than Teddy Bear Picnic day.“Logie and Lotti will be flying with us all summer and our crew can’t wait to introduce them onboard.“Last year the airline did everything it could to reunite a young girl with her lost teddy so this summer we thought we’d try and share some of that joy with children travelling with us.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will help reduce the initial barrier of connection for a defined period of time.Two events are planned at the St Magnus Centre in Kirkwall, from 6pm to 8pm on Wednesday July 11 then from 10am to 12pm on Thursday July 12 with a further event at the Doubletree by Hilton, Glasgow Central, from 10.30am to 12.30noon on Friday July 13 and finally, a webinar will take place on Tuesday July 17 from 10am to 12pm.Registration is required for the Alternative Approach consultations via the following link: https://www.ssen-transmission/news-views/articles/2018/6/solving-orkney-s-catch-22/Commenting on the Alternative Approach consultation events, Lauren Milligan, commercial policy manager, said: “As a customer-driven initiative, stakeholder engagement has shaped the Alternative Approach proposal to date.“We want to ensure that we develop a solution that not only works for network companies but also the wider industry and other connection customers and would therefore encourage anyone with an interest in our proposed Alternative Approach trial to register for one of our consultation events.”The final stage of consultation is planned to take place in Autumn on the various components of the transmission reinforcement project in advance of submitting planning applications to the relevant planning authorities, the Scottish Government, Marine Scotland and Orkney Islands Council.The progression of the project is subject to all necessary planning consents and securing regulatory approval from industry regulator Ofgem, with the Alternative Approach trial also subject to regulatory approval.For more information on the proposed Orkney transmission reinforcement, including links to both consultation documents, click here.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4768111.1531420726!/image/image.jpg","title":"jim duffy where is bono in the world s hour of need","story":"        Once the world had a superhero ready to jump on his private jet at a moment\u0026#8217s notice, writes Jim Duffy.                There was a time when all we needed to do was click our fingers and great things would happen. In times of world crises, when the politicians couldn’t quite manage to pull things off in a timely and seamless fashion, we could turn to one trusted soul to sort it all out.            From The Troubles in Ireland to the townships of Soweto, this man could make things happen. He had the ear of British Prime Ministers and US presidents. He had more super-human strength than Christopher Reeves and more cunning than Batman. But, he’s gone now. And we need him even more. Yes, it’s time to bring back Bono...            I recall in my early 20s listening to the U2 album, Live at Red Rocks. The frontman of this soon-to-be super group was Bono. At the time, he had all the makings of an Expendable and Incredible, all in one small package. But this super-hero could sing! He would knock out powerful tones with cogent lyrics designed to make us think. Supported by his fellow band members, Bono grew to international stardom. This was epitomised by his fabulous and haunting appearance at Bob Geldof’s Live Aid. Or was Midge Ure involved there also? Yes, I’m pretty sure that Midge played a key role there Bob. But, he seems to have been whitewashed from the credits. Not for us Scots though.Anyway, back to superheroes. Bono stole the show with his rendition of the U2 song, Bad. He came into the crowds, just like Jesus and the early prophets did. He hugged some wee lassie plucked from obscurity. He broke the risk management and crowd control rules to be “at one with people”. It was just brilliant to watch. And despite my nervousness about his prophetic actions, I do enjoy banging it on on YouTube every now and then. Yes, Bono was on his way to world saviour.READ MORE: U2 singer Bono says sorry over claims charity staff were bullied            He made damn sure that he used his superpowers well. He had the ear of the people and the they loved him and his music. A bit like Russell Crowe in the movie Gladiator, where he won the hearts and minds of those in the Coliseum, causing the young empower some angst. Winning hearts and minds always works well and Bono knew this.He had massive global reach and could sing about anything he wanted. If I’m not mistaken, it was Bono and Jim Kerr from Simple Minds who got Nelson Mandela freed right? Maybe not that simple, but I don’t know who else did. Do you? But, alas, after all his caped-crusader efforts to free us from tyranny and the forces of evil, Bono has going missing.At a time when one of the most decisive leaders of the Western world lands in Scotland and the UK, I have to ask the question. Where in God’s name is Bono when you need him? Only Bono could release us from the grip of this Western oligarch. Only Bono could be strong enough to stand up to President Trump and say: “No way!” Only Bono could have us – the proletariat – hanging on his every word as he tells, no demands, politicians do the right thing.            But, he is nowhere to be found and perhaps he does not want to be found. Has this superhero gone forever?In the USA, another live wire and actor superhero has had a go at President Trump. Robert De Niro has been vocal pre- and post-Trump’s election.De Niro has stood on platforms and denounced Trump, stating he would like to “punch him on the face”. Powerful words from one of the best-known (fictional) gangsters in the movie world. But, on this occasion, I do not see this particular “luvvie” making any real impact. It takes more than making an impassioned speech with the f-word thrown in to have an effect at red-carpet dinners. De Niro has failed, but he gets points for trying. This now makes the reappearance of Bono so much more of an issue.READ MORE: Paradise Papers: Bono and Mrs Brown’s Boys star in offshore tax have claims            Only Bono knows that a superhero has to get off his ass and on a plane, albeit a private jet, to make an impact.  After all, no point in Bono queuing at Stanstead airport waiting for a Ryanair flight that may be cancelled due to pilot industrial action this month. And Bono was willing to jet across the globe with the likes of Slick Willy Clinton to get that “money shot”.  When Bono hit the tarmac, he made it count. No politician was safe. Any God-fearing politico that refused an audience with Bono to discuss the s*** that was occurring in their country under their watch was doomed.Wee Bono would be giving speeches, hugging babies and sitting down with rival politicians to make you feel bad. So, why endure the Bono treatment when you should just meet him and acquiesce to him?  This world feels like it is in tatters right now. Never before have we needed a character like Bono to get behind. He was fearless and knew how to knit it all together to create some form of outcome. But I don’t think old Bono will be coming out of retirement all that soon. He has fought enough fights and has the scar tissue to prove it. So we need another superhero who can gel us together. And it can’t be Gareth Southgate – yet.  We need a new superhero to coalesce around as he or she or they hold Trump and others to account. The problem is right now, I cannot think of anyone suited to the role. Let’s keep praying in the meantime..."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4768117.1531420811!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment may s brexit plan is a bit like charge of light brigade","story":"        The Government\u0026#8217s Brexit White Paper has come under attack from all sides but at least provides hope of avoiding a disastrous \u0026#8216no-deal\u0026#8217 divorce from the EU.                “Cannon to right of them, Cannon to left of them, Cannon in front of them, Volleyed and thundered Stormed at with shot and shell, Boldly they rode and well, Into the jaws of Death, Into the mouth of hell, Rode the six hundred.”            The Charge of the Light Brigade was an infamous military mistake, but it is sometimes forgotten that the near-suicidal cavalry charge actually succeeded in taking the Russian guns during the Battle of Balaclava in 1854.            In finally spelling out the detail of what “Brexit means Brexit” actually means with the publication of a White Paper, Theresa May has sounded the charge.Tory backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg – along with assorted other hard Brexiteers – was quick to open fire from the right, declaring May’s plan to be the “greatest vassalage since King John paid homage to Phillip II at Le Goulet in 1200”. And, from the left, Labour said the Government was in “a mess”, Len McCluskey, of the Unite union, said the proposals were a “fudge which pleases no one”, and the SNP’s Fiona Hyslop warned May’s plan would “harm our economy”.Directly ahead lies the European Union, whose big guns have yet to start firing but may well do if they conclude the White Paper would undermine the principles that hold the EU together.READ MORE: Brexit White Paper plans ‘will harm Scotland’s economy’            With some politicians viewing May’s Brexit as too soft and others too hard, opinion further divided by party affiliations, and Labour looking for any chance to bring down the Government, it is difficult to see how the Prime Minister can win a vote in the Commons.And, if the UK cannot agree its position, it appears there will be a “no-deal” Brexit in March next year with severe economic consequences for Britan and the real risk of disaster – companies relocating or going bust, mass job losses and social unrest. That must not happen. Perhaps May and her supporters will manage to make it through their own metaphorical Valley of Death, but if they do not, there needs to be a plan for what happens next.Earlier this week, Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, called for cross-party talks “with a view to establishing a government of national unity” and for a second referendum. If the UK is to avoid a no-deal Brexit, both suggestions – met with scorn in the Commons – may need to be seriously considered.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve.

And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations.

Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities.

Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s

the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nFriday 13 Jul 2018 10:38

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve.

Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27403  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The family of Aidan McAnespie have waited over 30 years for truth and justice and they are commended for their persistence.
